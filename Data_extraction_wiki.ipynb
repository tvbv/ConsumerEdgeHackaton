            "Texts: ['Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland (also known as  Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 English children\\'s novel by Lewis Carroll, a mathematics don at the University of Oxford. It details the story of a girl named Alice who falls through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world of anthropomorphic creatures. It is seen as an example of the literary nonsense genre. The artist John Tenniel provided 42 wood-engraved illustrations for the book. \\n It received positive reviews upon release and is now one of the best-known works of Victorian literature; its narrative, structure, characters and imagery have had a widespread influence on popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.[1][2] It is credited as helping end an era of didacticism in children\\'s literature, inaugurating an era in which writing for children aimed to \"delight or entertain\".[3] The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children.[4] The titular character Alice shares her name with Alice Liddell, a girl Carroll knew—scholars disagree about the extent to which the character was based upon her.[5][6]\\n The book has never been out of print and has been translated into 174 languages. Its legacy includes adaptations to screen, radio, visual art, ballet, opera, and musical theatre, as well as theme parks, board games and video games.[7] Carroll published a sequel in 1871 entitled Through the Looking-Glass and a shortened version for young children, The Nursery \"Alice\", in 1890.\\n Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland was conceived on 4 July 1862, when Lewis Carroll and Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed up the river Isis with the three young daughters of Carroll\\'s friend Henry Liddell:[8][9] Lorina Charlotte (aged 13; \"Prima\" in the book\\'s prefatory verse); Alice Pleasance (aged 10; \"Secunda\" in the verse); and Edith Mary (aged 8; \"Tertia\" in the verse).[10]\\n The journey began at Folly Bridge, Oxford, and ended 5 miles (8\\xa0km) upstream at Godstow, Oxfordshire. During the trip, Carroll told the girls a story that he described in his diary as \"Alice\\'s Adventures Under Ground\", which his journal says he \"undertook to write out for Alice\".[11] Alice Liddell recalled that she asked Carroll to write it down: unlike other stories he had told her, this one she wanted to preserve.[12] She finally received the manuscript more than two years later.[13]\\n 4 July was known as the \"golden afternoon\", prefaced in the novel as a poem.[14] In fact, the weather around Oxford on 4 July was \"cool and rather wet\", although at least one scholar has disputed this claim.[15] Scholars debate whether Carroll in fact came up with Alice during the \"golden afternoon\" or whether the story was developed over a longer period.[14]\\n Carroll had known the Liddell children since around March 1856, when he befriended Harry Liddell.[16] He had met Lorina by early March as well.[17] In June 1856, he took the children out on the river.[18] Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, who wrote a literary biography of Carroll, suggests that Carroll favoured Alice Pleasance Liddell in particular because her name was ripe for allusion.[19] \"Pleasance\" means pleasure and the name \"Alice\" appeared in contemporary works, including the poem \"Alice Gray\" by William Mee, of which Carroll wrote a parody; Alice is a character in \"Dream-Children: A Reverie\", a prose piece by Charles Lamb.[19] Carroll, an amateur photographer by the late 1850s,[20] produced many photographic portraits of the Liddell children – and especially of Alice, of which 20 survive.[21]\\n Carroll began writing the manuscript of the story the next day, although that earliest version is lost. The girls and Carroll took another boat trip a month later, when he elaborated the plot of the story to Alice, and in November, he began working on the manuscript in earnest.[22] To add the finishing touches, he researched natural history in connection with the animals presented in the book and then had the book examined by other children—particularly those of George MacDonald. Though Carroll did add his own illustrations to the original copy, on publication he was advised to find a professional illustrator so that the pictures were more appealing to his audience. He subsequently approached John Tenniel to reinterpret his visions through his own artistic eye, telling him that the story had been well-liked by the children.[22]\\n Carroll began planning a print edition of the Alice story in 1863.[23] He wrote on 9 May 1863 that MacDonald\\'s family had suggested he publish Alice.[13] A diary entry for 2 July says that he received a specimen page of the print edition around that date.[23] On 26 November 1864, Carroll gave Alice the manuscript of Alice\\'s Adventures Under Ground, with illustrations by Carroll, dedicating it as \"A Christmas Gift to a Dear Child in Memory of a Summer\\'s Day\".[24][25] The published version of Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland is about twice the length of Alice\\'s Adventures Under Ground and includes episodes, such as the Mad Hatter\\'s Tea-Party (or Mad Tea Party), that do not appear in the manuscript.[26][23] The only known manuscript copy of Under Ground is held in the British Library.[23] Macmillan published a facsimile of the manuscript in 1886.[23]\\n Alice, a young girl, sits bored by a riverbank and spots a White Rabbit with a pocket watch and waistcoat lamenting that he is late. Surprised, Alice follows him down a rabbit hole, which sends her into a lengthy plummet but to a safe landing. Inside a room with a table, she finds a key to a tiny door, beyond which is a garden. While pondering how to fit through the door, she discovers a bottle labelled \"Drink me\". Alice drinks some of the bottle\\'s contents, and to her astonishment, she shrinks small enough to enter the door. However, she had left the key upon the table and cannot reach it. Alice then discovers and eats a cake labelled \"Eat me\", which causes her to grow to a tremendous size. Unhappy, Alice bursts into tears, and the passing White Rabbit flees in a panic, dropping a fan and two gloves. Alice uses the fan for herself, which causes her to shrink once more and leaves her swimming in a pool of her own tears. Within the pool, Alice meets various animals and birds, who convene on a bank and engage in a \"Caucus Race\" to dry themselves. Following the end of the race, Alice inadvertently frightens the animals away by discussing her cat.\\n The White Rabbit appears looking for the gloves and fan. Mistaking Alice for his maidservant, he orders her to go to his house and retrieve them. Alice finds another bottle and drinks from it, which causes her to grow to such an extent that she gets stuck in the house. Attempting to extract her, the White Rabbit and his neighbours eventually take to hurling pebbles that turn into small cakes. Alice eats one and shrinks herself, allowing her to flee into the forest. She meets a Caterpillar seated on a mushroom and smoking a hookah. During the Caterpillar\\'s questioning, Alice begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by her inability to remember a poem. Before crawling away, the Caterpillar says that a bite of one side of the mushroom will make her larger, while a bite from the other side will make her smaller. During a period of trial and error, Alice\\'s neck extends between the treetops, frightening a pigeon who mistakes her for a serpent. After shrinking to an appropriate height, Alice arrives at the home of a Duchess, who owns a perpetually grinning Cheshire Cat. The Duchess\\'s baby, whom she hands to Alice, transforms into a piglet, which Alice releases into the woods. The Cheshire Cat appears to Alice and directs her toward the Hatter and March Hare before disappearing, leaving his grin behind. Alice finds the Hatter, March Hare, and a sleepy Dormouse in the midst of a tea party. The Hatter explains that it is always 6\\xa0p.m. (tea time), claiming that time is standing still as punishment for the Hatter trying to \"kill it\". A conversation ensues around the table, and the riddle \"Why is a raven like a writing desk?\" is brought up. Alice impatiently decides to leave, calling the party stupid.\\n Noticing a door on a tree, Alice passes through and finds herself back in the room from the beginning of her journey. She takes the key and uses it to open the door to the garden, which turns out to be the croquet court of the Queen of Hearts, whose guard consists of living playing cards. Alice participates in a croquet game, in which hedgehogs are used as balls, flamingos are used as mallets, and soldiers act as hoops. The Queen is short-tempered and constantly orders beheadings. When the Cheshire Cat appears as only a head, the Queen orders his beheading, only to be told that such an act is impossible. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, Alice prompts the Queen to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter. When the Duchess ruminates on finding morals in everything around her, the Queen dismisses her on the threat of execution.\\n Alice then meets a Gryphon and a Mock Turtle, who dance to the Lobster Quadrille while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) a poem. The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\", during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for a trial, in which the Knave of Hearts stands accused of stealing the Queen\\'s tarts. The trial is conducted by the King of Hearts, and the jury is composed of animals that Alice previously met. Alice gradually grows in size and confidence, allowing herself increasingly frequent remarks on the irrationality of the proceedings. The Queen eventually commands Alice\\'s beheading, but Alice scoffs that the Queen\\'s guard is only a pack of cards. Although Alice holds her own for a time, the guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice\\'s sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be leaves from Alice\\'s face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\\n The main characters in Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland are the following:\\n In The Annotated Alice, Martin Gardner provides background information for the characters. The members of the boating party that first heard Carroll\\'s tale show up in chapter 3 (\"A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\"). Alice Liddell is there, while Carroll is caricatured as the Dodo (Lewis Carroll was a pen name for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson; because he stuttered when he spoke, he sometimes pronounced his last name as \"Dodo-Dodgson\"). The Duck refers to Robinson Duckworth, and the Lory and Eaglet to Alice Liddell\\'s sisters Lorina and Edith.[27]\\n Bill the Lizard may be a play on the name of British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.[28] One of Tenniel\\'s illustrations in Through the Looking-Glass— the 1871 sequel to Alice— depicts the character referred to as the \"Man in White Paper\" (whom Alice meets on a train) as a caricature of Disraeli, wearing a paper hat.[29] The illustrations of the Lion and the Unicorn (also in Looking-Glass) look like Tenniel\\'s Punch illustrations of William Ewart Gladstone and Disraeli, although Gardner says there is \"no proof\" that they were intended to represent these politicians.[30]\\n Gardner has suggested that the Hatter is a reference to Theophilus Carter, an Oxford furniture dealer, and that Tenniel apparently drew the Hatter to resemble Carter, on a suggestion of Carroll\\'s.[31] The Dormouse tells a story about three little sisters named Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie. These are the Liddell sisters: Elsie is L.C. (Lorina Charlotte); Tillie is Edith (her family nickname is Matilda); and Lacie is an anagram of Alice.[32]\\n The Mock Turtle speaks of a drawling-master, \"an old conger eel\", who came once a week to teach \"Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils\". This is a reference to the art critic John Ruskin, who came once a week to the Liddell house to teach the children to draw, sketch, and paint in oils.[33][34] The Mock Turtle sings \"Turtle Soup\", which is a parody of a song called \"Star of the Evening, Beautiful Star\", which the Liddells sang for Carroll.[35][36]\\n Carroll wrote multiple poems and songs for Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland, including:\\n Carroll\\'s biographer Morton N. Cohen reads Alice as a roman à clef populated with real figures from Carroll\\'s life. Alice is based on Alice Liddell; the Dodo is Carroll; Wonderland is Oxford; even the Mad Hatter\\'s Tea Party, according to Cohen, is a send-up of Alice\\'s own birthday party.[5] The critic Jan Susina rejects Cohen\\'s account, arguing that Alice the character bears a tenuous relationship with Alice Liddell.[6]\\n Beyond its refashioning of Carroll\\'s everyday life, Cohen argues, Alice critiques Victorian ideals of childhood. It is an account of \"the child\\'s plight in Victorian upper-class society\", in which Alice\\'s mistreatment by the creatures of Wonderland reflects Carroll\\'s own mistreatment by older people as a child.[43]\\n In the eighth chapter, three cards are painting the roses on a rose tree red, because they had accidentally planted a white-rose tree that the Queen of Hearts hates. According to Wilfrid Scott-Giles, the rose motif in Alice alludes to the English Wars of the Roses: red roses symbolised the House of Lancaster, and white roses the rival House of York.[44]\\n Alice is full of linguistic play, puns, and parodies.[45] According to Gillian Beer, Carroll\\'s play with language evokes the feeling of words for new readers: they \"still have insecure edges and a nimbus of nonsense blurs the sharp focus of terms\".[46] The literary scholar Jessica Straley, in a work about the role of evolutionary theory in Victorian children\\'s literature, argues that Carroll\\'s focus on language prioritises humanism over scientism by emphasising language\\'s role in human self-conception.[47]\\n Pat\\'s \"Digging for apples\" is a cross-language pun, as pomme de terre (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and pomme means apple.[48] In the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun declensions \"in her brother\\'s Latin Grammar, \\'A mouse – of a mouse – to a mouse – a mouse – O mouse!\\'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin\\'s six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: mus (nominative), muris (genitive), muri (dative), murem (accusative), (O) mus (vocative). The sixth case, mure (ablative) is absent from Alice\\'s recitation. Nilson suggests that Alice\\'s missing ablative is a pun on her father Henry Liddell\\'s work on the standard A Greek-English Lexicon, since ancient Greek does not have an ablative case. Further, mousa (μούσα, meaning muse) was a standard model noun in Greek textbooks of the time in paradigms of the first declension, short-alpha noun.[49]\\n Mathematics and logic are central to Alice.[50] As Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church, it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and Through the Looking-Glass.[51][52] Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserts in the New Scientist magazine that Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland in its final form as a satire on mid-19th century mathematics.[53]\\n Carina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice\\'s frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her \\'Curious Appetites\\'.[54] Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images. After the riddle \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\", the Hatter claims that Alice might as well say, \"I see what I eat…I eat what I see\" and so the riddle\\'s solution, put forward by Boe Birns, could be that \"A raven eats worms; a writing desk is worm-eaten\"; this idea of food encapsulates idea of life feeding on life itself, for the worm is being eaten and then becomes the eater—a horrific image of mortality.[55]\\n Nina Auerbach discusses how the novel revolves around eating and drinking which \"motivates much of her [Alice\\'s] behaviour\", for the story is essentially about things \"entering and leaving her mouth.\"[56] The animals of Wonderland are of particular interest, for Alice\\'s relation to them shifts constantly because, as Lovell-Smith states, Alice\\'s changes in size continually reposition her in the food chain, serving as a way to make her acutely aware of the \\'eat or be eaten\\' attitude that permeates Wonderland.[57]\\n Alice is an example of the literary nonsense genre.[58] According to Humphrey Carpenter, Alice\\'s brand of nonsense embraces the nihilistic and existential. Characters in nonsensical episodes such as the Mad Hatter\\'s Tea Party, in which it is always the same time, go on posing paradoxes that are never resolved.[59]\\n Wonderland is a rule-bound world, but its rules are not those of our world. The literary scholar Daniel Bivona writes that Alice is characterised by \"gamelike social structures.\"[60] She trusts in instructions from the beginning, drinking from the bottle labelled \"drink me\" after recalling, during her descent, that children who do not follow the rules often meet terrible fates.[61] Unlike the creatures of Wonderland, who approach their world\\'s wonders uncritically, Alice continues to look for rules as the story progresses. Gillian Beer suggests that Alice looks for rules to soothe her anxiety, while Carroll may have hunted for rules because he struggled with the implications of the non-Euclidean geometry then in development.[62]\\n The manuscript was illustrated by Carroll, who added 37 illustrations—printed in a facsimile edition in 1887.[24] John Tenniel provided 42 wood-engraved illustrations for the published version of the book.[63] The first print run was destroyed (or sold in the US)[64] at Carroll\\'s request because Tenniel was dissatisfied with the printing quality. There are only 22 known first edition copies in existence.[63] The book was reprinted and published in 1866.[24] Tenniel\\'s detailed black-and-white drawings remain the definitive depiction of the characters.[65]\\n Tenniel\\'s illustrations of Alice do not portray the real Alice Liddell,[6] who had dark hair and a short fringe. Alice has provided a challenge for other illustrators, including those of 1907 by Charles Pears and the full series of colour plates and line-drawings by Harry Rountree published in the (inter-War) Children\\'s Press (Glasgow) edition. Other significant illustrators include: Arthur Rackham (1907), Willy Pogany (1929), Mervyn Peake (1946), Ralph Steadman (1967), Salvador Dalí (1969), Graham Overden (1969), Max Ernst (1970), Peter Blake (1970), Tove Jansson (1977), Anthony Browne (1988), Helen Oxenbury (1999),[66] and Lisbeth Zwerger (1999).\\n Carroll first met Alexander Macmillan, a high-powered London publisher, on 19 October 1863.[13] His firm, Macmillan Publishers, agreed to publish Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland by sometime in 1864.[67] Carroll financed the initial print run, possibly because it gave him more editorial authority than other financing methods.[67] He managed publication details such as typesetting and engaged illustrators and translators.[68]\\n Macmillan had published The Water-Babies, also a children\\'s fantasy, in 1863, and suggested its design as a basis for Alice\\'s.[69] Carroll saw a specimen copy in May 1865.[70] 2,000 copies were printed by July, but Tenniel objected to their quality, and Carroll instructed Macmillan to halt publication so they could be reprinted.[24][71] In August, he engaged Richard Clay as an alternative printer for a new run of 2,000.[72] The reprint cost £600, paid entirely by Carroll.[73] He received the first copy of Clay\\'s edition on 9 November 1865.[73]\\n Macmillan finally published the new edition, printed by Richard Clay, in November 1865.[2][74] Carroll requested a red binding, deeming it appealing to young readers.[75][76]  A new edition, released in December 1865 for the Christmas market but carrying an 1866 date, was quickly printed.[77][78] The text blocks of the original edition were removed from the binding and sold with Carroll\\'s permission to the New York publishing house of D. Appleton & Company.[79] The binding for the Appleton Alice was identical to the 1866 Macmillan Alice, except for the publisher\\'s name at the foot of the spine. The title page of the Appleton Alice was an insert cancelling the original Macmillan title page of 1865 and bearing the New York publisher\\'s imprint and the date 1866.[2]\\n The entire print run sold out quickly. Alice was a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike.[2] Oscar Wilde was a fan;[80] Queen Victoria was also an avid reader of the book.[81] She reportedly enjoyed Alice enough that she asked for Carroll\\'s next book, which turned out to be a mathematical treatise; Carroll denied this.[82] The book has never been out of print.[2] Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland has been translated into 174\\xa0languages.[83]\\n The following list is a timeline of major publication events related to Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland: \\n Alice was published to critical praise.[100] One magazine declared it \"exquisitely wild, fantastic, [and] impossible\".[101] In the late 19th century, Walter Besant wrote that Alice in Wonderland \"was a book of that extremely rare kind which will belong to all the generations to come until the language becomes obsolete\".[102]\\n No story in English literature has intrigued me more than Lewis Carroll\\'s Alice in Wonderland. It fascinated me the first time I read it as a schoolboy. F. J. Harvey Darton argued in a 1932 book that Alice ended an era of didacticism in children\\'s literature, inaugurating a new era in which writing for children aimed to \"delight or entertain\".[3] In 2014, Robert McCrum named Alice \"one of the best loved in the English canon\" and called it \"perhaps the greatest, possibly most influential, and certainly the most world-famous Victorian English fiction\".[2] A 2020 review in Time states: \"The book changed young people\\'s literature. It helped to replace stiff Victorian didacticism with a looser, sillier, nonsense style that reverberated through the works of language-loving 20th-century authors as different as James Joyce, Douglas Adams and Dr. Seuss.\"[1] The protagonist of the story, Alice, has been recognised as a cultural icon.[104] In 2006, Alice in Wonderland was named among the icons of England in a public vote.[105]\\n Books for children in the Alice mould emerged as early as 1869 and continued to appear throughout the late 19th century.[107] Released in 1903, the British silent film Alice in Wonderland was the first screen adaptation of the book.[108]\\n In 2015, Robert Douglas-Fairhurst wrote in the Guardian,\\n Since the first publication of Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland 150 years ago, Lewis Carroll\\'s work has spawned a whole industry, from films and theme park rides to products such as a \"cute and sassy\" Alice costume (\"petticoat and stockings not included\"). The blank-faced little girl made famous by John Tenniel\\'s original illustrations has become a cultural inkblot we can interpret in any way we like.[7] Labelled \"a dauntless, no-nonsense heroine\" by the Guardian, the character of the plucky, yet proper, Alice has proven immensely popular and inspired similar heroines in literature and pop culture, many also named Alice in homage.[109] The book has inspired numerous film and television adaptations, which have multiplied, as the original work is now in the public domain in all jurisdictions. Musical works inspired by Alice include the Beatles\\'s song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", with songwriter John Lennon attributing the song\\'s fantastical imagery to his reading of Carroll\\'s books.[110] A popular figure in Japan since the country opened up to the West in the late 19th century, Alice has been a popular subject for writers of manga and a source of inspiration for Japanese fashion, in particular Lolita fashion.[111][112]\\n The first full major production was Alice in Wonderland, a musical play in London\\'s West End by Henry Savile Clarke and Walter Slaughter, which premiered at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1886. Twelve-year-old actress Phoebe Carlo (the first to play Alice) was personally selected by Carroll for the role.[113] Carroll attended a performance on 30 December 1886, writing in his diary that he enjoyed it.[114] The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the Globe Theatre in 1888, with Isa Bowman as Alice.[115][116]\\n As the book and its sequel are Carroll\\'s most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English pantomimes. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. Eva Le Gallienne\\'s stage adaptation of the Alice books premiered on 12 December 1932 and ended its run in May 1933.[117] The production was revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. A community theatre production of Alice was Olivia de Havilland\\'s first foray onto the stage.[118]\\n Joseph Papp staged Alice in Concert at the Public Theater in New York City in 1980. Elizabeth Swados wrote the book, lyrics, and music based on both Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the New York Shakespeare Festival. Meryl Streep played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty.[119] The cast also included Debbie Allen, Michael Jeter, and Mark Linn-Baker. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. \\n The 1992 musical theatre production Alice used both books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Carroll, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan writing the music.[120][121] Although the original production in Hamburg, Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album Alice in 2002.[122]\\n The English composer Joseph Horovitz composed an Alice in Wonderland ballet commissioned by the London Festival Ballet in 1953. It was performed frequently in England and the US.[123] A ballet by Christopher Wheeldon and Nicholas Wright commissioned for the Royal Ballet entitled Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland premiered in February 2011 at the Royal Opera House in London.[124][125] The ballet was based on the novel Wheeldon grew up reading as a child and is generally faithful to the original story, although some critics claimed it may have been too faithful.[126]\\n Unsuk Chin\\'s opera Alice in Wonderland premiered in 2007 at the Bavarian State Opera[127] and was hailed as World Premiere of the Year by the German opera magazine Opernwelt.[128] Gerald Barry\\'s 2016 one-act opera, Alice\\'s Adventures Under Ground, first staged in 2020 at the Royal Opera House, is a conflation of the two Alice books.[129] In 2022, the Opéra national du Rhin performed the ballet Alice, with a score by Philip Glass, in Mulhouse, France.[130]\\n Characters from the book are depicted in the stained glass windows of Carroll\\'s hometown church, All Saints\\', in Daresbury, Cheshire.[131] Another commemoration of Carroll\\'s work in his home county of Cheshire is the granite sculpture The Mad Hatter\\'s Tea Party, located in Warrington.[132] International works based on the book include the Alice in Wonderland statue in Central Park, New York, and the Alice statue in Rymill Park, Adelaide, Australia.[133][134] In 2015, Alice characters were featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of the book.[135]', 'Peter Pan is a fictional character created by Scottish novelist and playwright J. M. Barrie. A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures on the mythical island of Neverland as the leader of the Lost Boys, interacting with fairies, pirates, mermaids, Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.\\n Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and escapism. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie, The Little White Bird (1902, with chapters 13–18 published in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens in 1906), and the West End stage play Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn\\'t Grow Up (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel Peter and Wendy), the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie\\'s works. These include several films, television series and many other works.\\n Barrie commissioned a statue of Peter Pan by the sculptor George Frampton, which was erected overnight in Kensington Gardens on 30 April 1912 as a surprise to the children of London.[1] Six other statues have been cast from the original mould and displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail on the centenary of Barrie\\'s creation of the character.[2]\\n Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie\\'s The Little White Bird (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters 13–18, titled \"Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens\", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to Kensington Gardens in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as \"betwixt-and-between\" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of his stage play titled Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn\\'t Grow Up, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the Duke of York\\'s Theatre in London.[3] Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie\\'s publishers, Hodder and Stoughton, extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, with the addition of illustrations by Arthur Rackham.[4] Barrie later adapted and expanded the 1904 play\\'s storyline as a novel, which was published in 1911 as Peter and Wendy.\\n J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.[5]\\n Barrie never described Peter\\'s appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the reader and the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play, Peter\\'s outfit is made of autumn leaves and cobwebs. In the book and the play, he also carries a dagger for cutting and a sword for fighting, although in some versions he only has one of the two. [6] His name and playing the flute or pan pipes suggest that he is based on the Greek god and mythological character Pan. Barrie mentions in Peter and Wendy that Peter Pan still had all his \"first teeth\".[7] He describes him as a \"lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees\".[7] In The Little White Bird (1902) and Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens (1906), he is seven days old.[8]\\n Traditionally, the character has been played on stage by a female, but can also be played by a male.[9] In the original productions in the UK, Peter Pan\\'s costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tights, such as that worn by Nina Boucicault in 1904. This costume is exhibited at Barrie\\'s Birthplace.[10] The similar costume worn by Pauline Chase (who played the role from 1906 to 1913) is displayed in the Museum of London. Early editions of adaptations of the story also depict a red costume [11][12] but a green costume (whether or not made of leaves) becomes more usual from the 1920s,[13] and more so later after the release of Disney\\'s animated movie.\\n In the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights apparently made of cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed elf-like ears, brown eyes, and reddish hair.\\n In Hook (1991), the character is played as an adult by Robin Williams, with blue eyes and dark brown hair; in flashbacks to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. His ears appear pointed only when he is Peter Pan, not as Peter Banning. His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap) and he wields a gold bladed sword.\\n In the live-action 2003 Peter Pan film, he is portrayed by Jeremy Sumpter, with blond hair, green eyes, bare feet and a costume made of leaves and vines.\\n In the prequel to the main story 2015 Pan film, he is portrayed by Levi Miller, a young boy who was left as a baby by the orphanage until he gets captured by Blackbeard\\'s pirates and taken to Neverland. Here he wears just simple clothes.\\n Peter is an exaggerated stereotype of a boastful and careless boy. He claims greatness, even when such claims are questionable (such as congratulating himself when Wendy re-attaches his shadow). In the play and book, Peter symbolises the selfishness of childhood, and is portrayed as being forgetful and self-centred.\\n Peter has a nonchalant, devil-may-care attitude, and is fearlessly cocky when it comes to putting himself in danger. Barrie writes that when Peter thought he was going to die on Marooners\\' Rock, he felt scared, yet he felt only one shudder. With this blithe attitude, he says, \"To die will be an awfully big adventure.\" In the play, the unseen and unnamed narrator ponders what might have been if Peter had stayed with Wendy, so that his cry might have become, \"To live would be an awfully big adventure!\", \"but he can never quite get the hang of it\".[14]\\n Peter\\'s archetypal quality is his unending youth. In Peter and Wendy, it is explained that Peter must forget his own adventures and what he learns about the world in order to stay childlike.\\n Peter\\'s ability to fly is explained, but inconsistently. In The Little White Bird, he is able to fly because he is said to be part bird, like all babies. In the play and novel, he teaches the Darling children to fly using a combination of \"lovely wonderful thoughts\" and fairy dust. In Barrie\\'s Dedication to the play Peter Pan, The Boy Who Wouldn\\'t Grow up,[15] the author attributes the idea of fairy dust being necessary for flight to practical needs:\\n ...after the first production I had to add something to the play at the request of parents (who thus showed that they thought me the responsible person) about no one being able to fly until the fairy dust had been blown on him; so many children having gone home and tried it from their beds and needed surgical attention.  – J. M. Barrie\\n Peter has an effect on the whole of Neverland and its inhabitants when he is there. Barrie states that although Neverland appears different to every child, the island \"wakes up\" when Peter returns from his trip to London. In the chapter \"The Mermaids\\' Lagoon\" in the book Peter and Wendy, Barrie writes that there is almost nothing that Peter cannot do. He is a skilled swordsman, rivalling even Captain Hook, whose hand he cut off in a duel. He has remarkably keen vision and hearing. He is skilled in mimicry, copying the voice of Hook and the ticking of the clock in the crocodile.\\n Peter has the ability to imagine things into existence and he is able to sense danger when it is near.\\n In Peter and Wendy, Barrie states that the Peter Pan legend Mrs. Darling heard as a child, was that when children died, he accompanied them part of the way to their destination so they would not be frightened.\\n In the original play, Peter states that no one must ever touch him (though he does not know why). The stage directions specify that no one does so throughout the play. Wendy approaches Peter to give him a \"kiss\" (thimble), but is prevented by Tinker Bell. However, John Caird and Trevor Nunn\\'s introduction to the script for the 1997 Royal National Theatre production, states that this was never Barrie\\'s original intention, and was only added for a production in 1927, where Jean Forbes-Robertson took the title role, and played the part with a lighter, more fairy-like, physicality. Robertson was to play the part almost every year until 1939.\\n Peter Pan is a free spirit, being too young to be burdened with the effects of education or to have an adult appreciation of moral responsibility. As a \"betwixt-and-between\", who can fly and speak the language of fairies and birds, Peter is part animal and part human. According to psychologist Rosalind Ridley, by comparing Peter\\'s behaviour to adults and to other animals, Barrie raises many post-Darwinian questions about the origins of human nature and behaviour. As \"the boy who wouldn\\'t grow up\", Peter exhibits many aspects of the stages of cognitive development seen in children and can be regarded as Barrie\\'s memory of himself as a child, being both charmingly childlike and childishly solipsistic.[16]\\n Peter Pan ran away from his parents when he was a baby as told in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens and Peter and Wendy. Finding the window closed and seeing a new baby boy in the house when he returned some time later, he believed his parents no longer wanted him and never came back. This younger sibling is referred to in the chapter \"Lock-Out Time\" in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens but is not mentioned again.\\n While in Kensington Gardens, Peter meets a lost girl named Maimie Mannering and the two quickly become friends. Peter proposes marriage to Maimie. While Maimie wants to stay in the Gardens with Peter, she comes to realise that her mother is so worried that she must return to her. Maimie promises to always remember Peter and goes back to her mother. When Maimie grows up, she continues to think of Peter, dedicating presents and letters to him. To remember Maimie, Peter rides the imaginary goat that Maimie created for him. She is considered to be the literary predecessor of Wendy Darling.[17]\\n It is hinted that Wendy may have romantic feelings for Peter, but unrequited because of his inability to love.\\n In the original novel, Peter later befriends Wendy\\'s daughter Jane (and her subsequent daughter Margaret), and it is implied that this pattern will go on forever. From time to time, Peter visits the real world, and befriends children. Wendy Darling, whom he recruited to be his \"mother\", is the most significant of them; he also brings her brothers John and Michael to Neverland at her request. It is mentioned that Wendy was the only girl who captured his attention.\\n In the 1991 film Hook, an older Wendy implies that she used to (and perhaps, still does) have feelings for Peter, saying that she was shocked that he did not prevent her wedding day. In the 2002 sequel to the 1953 Disney film, Return to Neverland, Peter and a grown-up Wendy are briefly, but happily, reunited after many years and continue to show feelings for each other. In the 2003 film Peter Pan, the feeling is mutual. Captain Hook can only take away Peter\\'s ability to fly by thoughts of Wendy leaving him, growing up, and replacing him with a husband. Wendy saves Peter by giving him her hidden kiss which gives him the will to live, signifying she is his true love. In some versions, he marries her or her grandaughter Moira.\\n John is the middle child of the Darlings, and plays father and mother with Wendy. On the Neverland, he serves as the boldest of the Lost Boys and the only one who is not entirely convinced by Peter\\'s games. \"\\'Do be more polite to him,\\' Wendy whispered to John...\\'Then tell him to stop showing off,\\' said John.\"[18] Michael, the youngest of the Darlings, is the least prepared for the bloodthirsty life on the Neverland. When Michael kills a pirate in Act V, Wendy is mortified because he is so happy about it.[14] Peter Pan In Scarlet reveals that Michael died in World War I.\\n The parents of Wendy, John and Michael. Mr. Darling works as a clerk in the City, and is named after George Llewelyn Davies. Mrs. Darling is named after Mary Ansell, Barrie\\'s wife.\\n Tiger Lily is the daughter of Great Big Little Panther, the chief of the Native American tribe that resides in Neverland. Barrie refers to her as \"a princess in her own right\", and she is often described as such. She is kidnapped by the pirates and left to die on Marooners\\' Rock but is rescued by Peter. It is hinted later that she may have romantic feelings for Peter but he does not return them, as he is completely oblivious to other people\\'s feelings. In the Disney film, Tiger Lily shows her gratitude by performing a dance for Peter and kissing him. The kiss makes him turn bright red and makes Wendy jealous of Tiger Lily.\\n Tinker Bell is a common fairy who is Peter Pan\\'s best friend and is often jealously protective of him. He nicknames her \"Tink\".  She is the friend who helps him in his escapades. Tink\\'s malicious actions are usually caused by her jealousy; these lead to the Lost Boys shooting arrows at Wendy, and eventually revealing Peter\\'s hideout to Captain Hook, in the hope that Wendy will be captured rather than Peter. When Tink realises her serious mistake, she risks her own life by drinking the poison Hook has left for Peter. Her extreme loyalty and dedication to Peter are everlasting.\\n Peter is the leader of the Lost Boys, which include Tootles, Nibs, Slightly, Curly, and The Twins. The Lost Boys is a band of boys who were lost by their parents after they \"fall out of their perambulators\" and came to live in Neverland. In Barrie\\'s novel Peter and Wendy (but not the original play Peter Pan), it is stated that Peter \"thins them out\" when they start to grow up.\\n In the song \"I Won\\'t Grow Up\" from the 1954 musical, the boys sing \"I will stay a boy forever\", to which Peter replies \"And be banished if I don\\'t\".\\n In Peter Pan in Scarlet (2006), the official sequel to Barrie\\'s Peter and Wendy, what happens to the Lost Boys when they begin to grow up is revealed when Slightly starts to grow older, as Peter banishes him to Nowhereland (which means that he and all his allies will ignore the banished person\\'s existence), the home of all the Long Lost Boys whom Peter has banished in times past.\\n The crocodile is Captain Hook\\'s nemesis. After Peter Pan cut off Captain Hook\\'s hand in a fight and threw it into the sea, the crocodile swallowed it and got a taste for Hook, so it now seeks to consume him whole. It also swallowed a ticking clock, which alerts Hook of its presence.\\n Captain Hook, whose right hand was cut off in a duel, is Peter Pan\\'s arch-enemy who leads a large group of pirates. Captain Hook\\'s two principal fears are the sight of his own blood (which is supposedly an unnatural colour) and one saltwater crocodile. His name plays on the iron hook that replaced his hand cut off by Peter Pan and eaten by the aforementioned crocodile, which continues to pursue Hook. In the 1991 film Hook Captain Hook kidnaps the children of Peter Banning (the adoptive identity of  Peter Pan) when he left Neverland to grow up and married Moira Darling (the Granddaughter of Wendy Darling) with whom he would have the two children whom Hook would kidnap: Maggie and Jack. Hook in this film is also shown to questioning his existence due to the fact Banning/Pan has been away from Neverland  so long does not remember anything when he first returns to Neverland . At Smee\\'s suggestion Hook conjures up plan to defeat plan Pan by having his own children turn against him. Although Maggie is never swayed by this plan Jack initially sides with the pirates due to the prior broken promises of his father . However upon realising that his dad is Peter Pan Jack has a change of heart and betrays Hook .  Hook is eventually defeated by Pan eaten by the crocodile which the pirate himself had killed in Pan\\'s prior absence and had converted into clock.\\n Mr. Smee is Captain Hook\\'s boatswain (\"bo\\'sun\") and right-hand man in J. M. Barrie\\'s play Peter Pan and the novel Peter and Wendy. Mr. Smee is Captain Hook\\'s direct confidant. Unlike the other pirates, Smee is often clumsy and incapable of capturing any of the Lost Boys. Rather than engaging in Hook\\'s evil schemes, Smee finds excitement in bagging loot and treasures.\\n The name Peter Pan has been adopted for various purposes over the years:\\n Barrie commissioned a statue of Peter Pan by the sculptor George Frampton, which was erected overnight in Kensington Gardens on 30 April 1912 as a May Day surprise to the children of London. Seven statues have been cast from the original mould.[35] The other six are located in:\\n Other statues are:', 'Robin Hood is a legendary heroic outlaw originally depicted in English folklore and subsequently featured in literature, theatre, and cinema. He stole from the rich and gave to the poor. According to legend, he was a highly skilled archer and swordsman.[1] In some versions of the legend, he is depicted as being of noble birth, and in modern retellings he is sometimes depicted as having fought in the Crusades before returning to England to find his lands taken by the Sheriff. In the oldest known versions, he is instead a member of the yeoman class. He is traditionally depicted dressed in Lincoln green.\\n Through retellings, additions, and variations, a body of familiar characters associated with Robin Hood has been created. These include his lover, Maid Marian; his band of outlaws, the Merry Men; and his chief opponent, the Sheriff of Nottingham. The Sheriff is often depicted as assisting Prince John in usurping the rightful but absent King Richard, to whom Robin Hood remains loyal. He became a popular folk figure in the Late Middle Ages, and his partisanship of the common people and opposition to the Sheriff are some of the earliest-recorded features of the legend, whereas his political interests and setting during the Angevin era developed in later centuries. The earliest known ballads featuring him are from the 15th century.\\n There have been numerous variations and adaptations of the story over the subsequent years, and the story continues to be widely represented in literature, film, and television media today. Robin Hood is considered one of the best-known tales of English folklore. In popular culture, the term \"Robin Hood\" is often used to describe a heroic outlaw or rebel against tyranny.\\n The origins of the legend as well as the historical context have been debated for centuries. There are numerous references to historical figures with similar names that have been proposed as possible evidence of his existence, some dating back to the late 13th century. At least eight plausible origins to the story have been mooted by historians and folklorists, including suggestions that \"Robin Hood\" was a stock alias used by or in reference to bandits.\\n The first clear reference to \"rhymes of Robin Hood\" is from the alliterative poem Piers Plowman, thought to have been composed in the 1370s, followed shortly afterwards by a quotation of a later common proverb,[2] \"many men speak of Robin Hood and never shot his bow\",[3] in Friar Daw\\'s Reply (c. 1402)[4] and a complaint in Dives and Pauper (1405–1410) that people would rather listen to \"tales and songs of Robin Hood\" than attend Mass.[5] Robin Hood is also mentioned in a famous Lollard tract[6] dated to the first half of the fifteenth century[7] (thus also possibly predating his other earliest historical mentions)[8] alongside several other folk heroes such as Guy of Warwick, Bevis of Hampton, and Sir Lybeaus.[9]\\n However, the earliest surviving copies of the narrative ballads that tell his story date to the second half of the 15th century, or the first decade of the 16th century. In these early accounts, Robin Hood\\'s partisanship of the lower classes, his devotion to the Virgin Mary and associated special regard for women, his outstanding skill as an archer, his anti-clericalism, and his particular animosity towards the Sheriff of Nottingham are already clear.[10] Little John, Much the Miller\\'s Son, and Will Scarlet (as Will \"Scarlok\" or \"Scathelocke\") all appear, although not yet Maid Marian or Friar Tuck. The friar has been part of the legend since at least the later 15th century, when he is mentioned in a Robin Hood play script.[11]\\n In modern popular culture, Robin Hood is typically seen as a contemporary and supporter of the late-12th-century king Richard the Lionheart, Robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of Richard\\'s brother John while Richard was away at the Third Crusade. This view first gained currency in the 16th century.[12] It is not supported by the earliest ballads. The early compilation, A Gest of Robyn Hode, names the king as \\'Edward\\'; and while it does show Robin Hood accepting the King\\'s pardon, he later repudiates it and returns to the greenwood.[13][14] The oldest surviving ballad, Robin Hood and the Monk, gives even less support to the picture of Robin Hood as a partisan of the true king. The setting of the early ballads is usually attributed by scholars to either the 13th century or the 14th, although it is recognised they are not necessarily historically consistent.[15]\\n The early ballads are also quite clear on Robin Hood\\'s social status: he is a yeoman. While the precise meaning of this term changed over time, including free retainers of an aristocrat and small landholders, it always referred to commoners. The essence of it in the present context was \"neither a knight nor a peasant or \\'husbonde\\' but something in between\".[16] Artisans (such as millers) were among those regarded as \\'yeomen\\' in the 14th century.[17] From the 16th century on, there were attempts to elevate Robin Hood to the nobility, such as in Richard Grafton\\'s Chronicle at Large;[18] Anthony Munday presented him at the very end of the century as the Earl of Huntingdon in two extremely influential plays, as he is still commonly presented in modern times.[19]\\n As well as ballads, the legend was also transmitted by \\'Robin Hood games\\' or plays that were an important part of the late medieval and early modern May Day festivities. The first record of a Robin Hood game was in 1426 in Exeter, but the reference does not indicate how old or widespread this custom was at the time. The Robin Hood games are known to have flourished in the later 15th and 16th centuries.[20] It is commonly stated as fact that Maid Marian and a jolly friar (at least partly identifiable with Friar Tuck) entered the legend through the May Games.[21]\\n The earliest surviving text of a Robin Hood ballad is the 15th-century \"Robin Hood and the Monk\".[22] This is preserved in Cambridge University manuscript Ff.5.48. Written after 1450,[23] it contains many of the elements still associated with the legend, from the Nottingham setting to the bitter enmity between Robin and the local sheriff.\\n The first printed version is A Gest of Robyn Hode (c. 1500), a collection of separate stories that attempts to unite the episodes into a single continuous narrative.[24] After this comes \"Robin Hood and the Potter\",[25] contained in a manuscript of c. 1503. \"The Potter\" is markedly different in tone from \"The Monk\": whereas the earlier tale is \"a thriller\"[26] the latter is more comic, its plot involving trickery and cunning rather than straightforward force.\\n Other early texts are dramatic pieces, the earliest being the fragmentary Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham[27] (c. 1475). These are particularly noteworthy as they show Robin\\'s integration into May Day rituals towards the end of the Middle Ages; Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham, among other points of interest, contains the earliest reference to Friar Tuck.\\n The plots of neither \"the Monk\" nor \"the Potter\" are included in the Gest; and neither is the plot of \"Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne\", which is probably at least as old as those two ballads although preserved in a more recent copy. Each of these three ballads survived in a single copy, so it is unclear how much of the medieval legend has survived, and what has survived may not be typical of the medieval legend. It has been argued that the fact that the surviving ballads were preserved in written form in itself makes it unlikely they were typical; in particular, stories with an interest for the gentry were by this view more likely to be preserved.[28] The story of Robin\\'s aid to the \\'poor knight\\' that takes up much of the Gest may be an example.\\n The character of Robin in these first texts is rougher edged than in his later incarnations. In \"Robin Hood and the Monk\", for example, he is shown as quick tempered and violent, assaulting Little John for defeating him in an archery contest; in the same ballad, Much the Miller\\'s Son casually kills a \"little page\" in the course of rescuing Robin Hood from prison.[29] No extant early ballad actually shows Robin Hood \"giving to the poor\", although in \"A Gest of Robyn Hode\" Robin does make a large loan to an unfortunate knight, which he does not in the end require to be repaid;[30] and later in the same ballad Robin Hood states his intention of giving money to the next traveller to come down the road if he happens to be poor.\\n Of my good he shall haue some,\\nYf he be a por man.[31]\\n As it happens the next traveller is not poor, but it seems in context that Robin Hood is stating a general policy. The first explicit statement to the effect that Robin Hood habitually robbed from the rich to give the poor can be found in John Stow\\'s Annales of England (1592), about a century after the publication of the Gest.[32][33] But from the beginning Robin Hood is on the side of the poor; the Gest quotes Robin Hood as instructing his men that when they rob:\\n loke ye do no husbonde harme\\nThat tilleth with his ploughe.\\nNo more ye shall no gode yeman\\nThat walketh by gren-wode shawe;\\nNe no knyght ne no squyer\\nThat wol be a gode felawe.[13][14]\\n And in its final lines the Gest sums up:\\n he was a good outlawe,\\nAnd dyde pore men moch god.\\n Within Robin Hood\\'s band, medieval forms of courtesy rather than modern ideals of equality are generally in evidence. In the early ballad, Robin\\'s men usually kneel before him in strict obedience: in A Gest of Robyn Hode the king even observes that \"His men are more at his byddynge/Then my men be at myn.\" Their social status, as yeomen, is shown by their weapons: they use swords rather than quarterstaffs.[further explanation needed] The only character to use a quarterstaff in the early ballads is the potter, and Robin Hood does not take to a staff until the 17th-century Robin Hood and Little John.[34]\\n The political and social assumptions underlying the early Robin Hood ballads have long been controversial. J. C. Holt  influentially argued that the Robin Hood legend was cultivated in the households of the gentry, and that it would be mistaken to see in him a figure of peasant revolt. He is not a peasant but a yeoman, and his tales make no mention of the complaints of the peasants, such as oppressive taxes.[35] He appears not so much as a revolt against societal standards as an embodiment of them, being generous, pious, and courteous, opposed to stingy, worldly, and churlish foes.[36] Other scholars have by contrast stressed the subversive aspects of the legend, and see in the medieval Robin Hood ballads a plebeian literature hostile to the feudal order.[37]\\n By the early 15th century at the latest, Robin Hood had become associated with May Day celebrations, with revellers dressing as Robin or as members of his band for the festivities. This was not common throughout England, but in some regions the custom lasted until Elizabethan times, and during the reign of Henry VIII, was briefly popular at court.[38] Robin was often allocated the role of a May King, presiding over games and processions, but plays were also performed with the characters in the roles,[39] sometimes performed at church ales, a means by which churches raised funds.[40]\\n A complaint of 1492, brought to the Star Chamber, accuses men of acting riotously by coming to a fair as Robin Hood and his men; the accused defended themselves on the grounds that the practice was a long-standing custom to raise money for churches, and they had not acted riotously but peaceably.[41]\\n It is from the association with the May Games that Robin\\'s romantic attachment to Maid Marian (or Marion) apparently stems. A \"Robin and Marion\" figured in 13th-century French \\'pastourelles\\' (of which Jeu de Robin et Marion c. 1280 is a literary version) and presided over the French May festivities; \"This Robin and Marion tended to preside, in the intervals of the attempted seduction of the latter by a series of knights, over a variety of rustic pastimes.\"[42] In the Jeu de Robin and Marion, Robin and his companions have to rescue Marion from the clutches of a \"lustful knight\".[43] This play is distinct from the English legends,[38] although Dobson and Taylor regard it as \\'highly probable\\' that this French Robin\\'s name and functions travelled to the English May Games, where they fused with the Robin Hood legend.[44] Both Robin and Marian were certainly associated with May Day festivities in England (as was Friar Tuck), but these may have been originally two distinct types of performance. Alexander Barclay in his Ship of Fools, writing in c. 1500, refers to \\'some merry fytte of Maid Marian or else of Robin Hood\\' – but the characters were brought together.[45] Marian did not immediately gain the unquestioned role; in Robin Hood\\'s Birth, Breeding, Valor, and Marriage, his sweetheart is \"Clorinda the Queen of the Shepherdesses\".[46] Clorinda survives in some later stories as an alias of Marian.[47]\\n The earliest preserved script of a Robin Hood play is the fragmentary Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham[27] This apparently dates to the 1470s and circumstantial evidence suggests it was probably performed at the household of Sir John Paston. This fragment appears to tell the story of Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne.[48] There is also an early playtext appended to a 1560 printed edition of the Gest. This includes a dramatic version of the story of Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar and a version of the first part of the story of Robin Hood and the Potter. (Neither of these ballads is known to have existed in print at the time, and there is no earlier record known of the \"Curtal Friar\" story.) The publisher describes the text as a \\'playe of Robyn Hood, verye proper to be played in Maye games\\', but does not seem to be aware that the text actually contains two separate plays.[49] An especial point of interest in the \"Friar\" play is the appearance of a ribald woman who is unnamed but apparently to be identified with the bawdy Maid Marian of the May Games.[50] She does not appear in extant versions of the ballad.\\n James VI of Scotland was entertained by a Robin Hood play at Dirleton Castle produced by his favourite the Earl of Arran in May 1585, while there was plague in Edinburgh.[51]\\n In 1598, Anthony Munday wrote a pair of plays on the Robin Hood legend, The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington (published 1601). These plays drew on a variety of sources, including apparently \"A Gest of Robin Hood\", and were influential in fixing the story of Robin Hood to the period of Richard I. Stephen Thomas Knight has suggested that Munday drew heavily on Fulk Fitz Warin, a historical 12th century outlawed nobleman and enemy of King John, in creating his Robin Hood.[52] The play identifies Robin Hood as Robert, Earl of Huntingdon, following in Richard Grafton\\'s association of Robin Hood with the gentry,[18] and identifies Maid Marian with \"one of the semi-mythical Matildas persecuted by King John\".[53] The plays are complex in plot and form, the story of Robin Hood appearing as a play-within-a-play presented at the court of Henry VIII and written by the poet, priest and courtier John Skelton. Skelton himself is presented in the play as acting the part of Friar Tuck. Some scholars have conjectured that Skelton may have indeed written a lost Robin Hood play for Henry VIII\\'s court, and that this play may have been one of Munday\\'s sources.[54] Henry VIII himself with eleven of his nobles had impersonated \"Robyn Hodes men\" as part of his \"Maying\" in 1510. Robin Hood is known to have appeared in a number of other lost and extant Elizabethan plays. In 1599, the play George a Green, the Pinner of Wakefield places Robin Hood in the reign of Edward IV.[55] Edward I, a play by George Peele first performed in 1590–91, incorporates a Robin Hood game played by the characters. Llywelyn the Great, the last independent Prince of Wales, is presented playing Robin Hood.[56]\\n Fixing the Robin Hood story to the 1190s had been first proposed by John Major in his Historia Majoris Britanniæ (1521), (and he also may have been influenced in so doing by the story of Warin);[52] this was the period in which King Richard was absent from the country, fighting in the Third Crusade.[57]\\n William Shakespeare makes reference to Robin Hood in his late-16th-century play The Two Gentlemen of Verona. In it, the character Valentine is banished from Milan and driven out through the forest where he is approached by outlaws who, upon meeting him, desire him as their leader. They comment, \"By the bare scalp of Robin Hood\\'s fat friar, This fellow were a king for our wild faction!\"[58] Robin Hood is also mentioned in As You Like It. When asked about the exiled Duke Senior, the character of Charles says that he is \"already in the forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England\". Justice Silence sings a line from an unnamed Robin Hood ballad, the line is \"Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John\" in Act 5 scene 3 of Henry IV, part 2. In Henry IV part 1 Act 3 scene 3, Falstaff refers to Maid Marian, implying she is a by-word for unwomanly or unchaste behaviour.\\n Ben Jonson produced the incomplete masque The Sad Shepherd, or a Tale of Robin Hood[59] in part as a satire on Puritanism. It is about half finished and his death in 1637 may have interrupted writing. Jonson\\'s only pastoral drama, it was written in sophisticated verse and included supernatural action and characters.[60] It has had little impact on the Robin Hood tradition but earns mention as the work of a major dramatist.\\n The 1642 London theatre closure by the Puritans interrupted the portrayal of Robin Hood on the stage. The theatres would reopen with the Restoration in 1660. Robin Hood did not appear on the Restoration stage, except for \"Robin Hood and his Crew of Souldiers\" acted in Nottingham on the day of the coronation of Charles II in 1661. This short play adapts the story of the king\\'s pardon of Robin Hood to refer to the Restoration.[61]\\n However, Robin Hood appeared on the 18th-century stage in various farces and comic operas.[62] Alfred, Lord Tennyson would write a four-act Robin Hood play at the end of the 19th century, \"The Forrestors\". It is fundamentally based on the Gest but follows the traditions of placing Robin Hood as the Earl of Huntingdon in the time of Richard I and making the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John rivals with Robin Hood for Maid Marian\\'s hand.[63] The return of King Richard brings a happy ending.\\n With the advent of printing came the Robin Hood broadside ballads. Exactly when they displaced the oral tradition of Robin Hood ballads is unknown but the process seems to have been completed by the end of the 16th century. Near the end of the 16th century an unpublished prose life of Robin Hood was written, and included in the Sloane Manuscript. Largely a paraphrase of the Gest, it also contains material revealing that the author was familiar with early versions of a number of the Robin Hood broadside ballads.[64] Not all of the medieval legend was preserved in the broadside ballads, there is no broadside version of Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne or of Robin Hood and the Monk, which did not appear in print until the 18th and 19th centuries respectively. However, the Gest was reprinted from time to time throughout the 16th and 17th centuries.\\n No surviving broadside ballad can be dated with certainty before the 17th century, but during that century, the commercial broadside ballad became the main vehicle for the popular Robin Hood legend.[65] These broadside ballads were in some cases newly fabricated but were mostly adaptations of the older verse narratives. The broadside ballads were fitted to a small repertoire of pre-existing tunes resulting in an increase of \"stock formulaic phrases\" making them \"repetitive and verbose\",[66] they commonly feature Robin Hood\\'s contests with artisans: tinkers, tanners, and butchers. Among these ballads is Robin Hood and Little John telling the famous story of the quarter-staff fight between the two outlaws.\\n Dobson and Taylor wrote, \\'More generally the Robin of the broadsides is a much less tragic, less heroic and in the last resort less mature figure than his medieval predecessor\\'.[67] In most of the broadside ballads Robin Hood remains a plebeian figure, a notable exception being Martin Parker\\'s attempt at an overall life of Robin Hood, A True Tale of Robin Hood, which also emphasises the theme of Robin Hood\\'s generosity to the poor more than the broadsheet ballads do in general.\\n The 17th century introduced the minstrel Alan-a-Dale. He first appeared in a 17th-century broadside ballad, and unlike many of the characters thus associated, managed to adhere to the legend.[46] The prose life of Robin Hood in Sloane Manuscript contains the substance of the Alan-a-Dale ballad but tells the story about Will Scarlet.\\n In the 18th century, the stories began to develop a slightly more farcical vein. From this period there are a number of ballads in which Robin is severely \\'drubbed\\' by a succession of tradesmen including a tanner, a tinker, and a ranger.[57] In fact, the only character who does not get the better of Hood is the luckless Sheriff. Yet even in these ballads Robin is more than a mere simpleton: on the contrary, he often acts with great shrewdness. The tinker, setting out to capture Robin, only manages to fight with him after he has been cheated out of his money and the arrest warrant he is carrying. In Robin Hood\\'s Golden Prize, Robin disguises himself as a friar and cheats two priests out of their cash. Even when Robin is defeated, he usually tricks his foe into letting him sound his horn, summoning the Merry Men to his aid. When his enemies do not fall for this ruse, he persuades them to drink with him instead (see Robin Hood\\'s Delight).\\n In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Robin Hood ballads were mostly sold in \"Garlands\" of 16 to 24 Robin Hood ballads; these were crudely printed chap books aimed at the poor. The garlands added nothing to the substance of the legend but ensured that it continued after the decline of the single broadside ballad.[68] In the 18th century also, Robin Hood frequently appeared in criminal biographies and histories of highwaymen compendia.[69]\\n In 1765, Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore) published Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, including ballads from the 17th-century Percy Folio manuscript which had not previously been printed, most notably Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne which is generally regarded as in substance a genuine late medieval ballad.\\n In 1795, Joseph Ritson published an enormously influential edition of the Robin Hood ballads Robin Hood: A collection of all the Ancient Poems Songs and Ballads now extant, relative to that celebrated Outlaw.[70][71] \\'By providing English poets and novelists with a convenient source book, Ritson gave them the opportunity to recreate Robin Hood in their own imagination,\\'[72] Ritson\\'s collection included the Gest and put the Robin Hood and the Potter ballad in print for the first time. The only significant omission was Robin Hood and the Monk which would eventually be printed in 1806. In all, Ritson printed 33 Robin Hood ballads [73] (and a 34th, now commonly known as Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon that he included as the second part of Robin Hood Newly Revived which he had retitled \"Robin Hood and the Stranger\").[74] Ritson\\'s interpretation of Robin Hood was also influential, having influenced the modern concept of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor as it exists today.[75][76][77][78] Himself a supporter of the principles of the French Revolution and admirer of Thomas Paine, Ritson held that Robin Hood was a genuinely historical, and genuinely heroic, character who had stood up against tyranny in the interests of the common people.[72] J.\\xa0C. Holt has been quick to point out, however, that Ritson \"began as a Jacobite and ended as a Jacobin,\" and \"certainly reconstructed him [Robin] in the image of a radical.\"[79]\\n In his preface to the collection, Ritson assembled an account of Robin Hood\\'s life from the various sources available to him, and concluded that Robin Hood was born in around 1160, and thus had been active in the reign of Richard I. He thought that Robin was of aristocratic extraction, with at least \\'some pretension\\' to the title of Earl of Huntingdon, that he was born in an unlocated Nottinghamshire village of Locksley and that his original name was Robert Fitzooth. Ritson gave the date of Robin Hood\\'s death as 18 November 1247, when he would have been around 87 years old. In copious and informative notes Ritson defends every point of his version of Robin Hood\\'s life.[80] In reaching his conclusion Ritson relied or gave weight to a number of unreliable sources, such as the Robin Hood plays of Anthony Munday and the Sloane Manuscript. Nevertheless, Dobson and Taylor credit Ritson with having \\'an incalculable effect in promoting the still continuing quest for the man behind the myth\\', and note that his work remains an \\'indispensable handbook to the outlaw legend even now\\'.[81]\\n Ritson\\'s friend Walter Scott used Ritson\\'s anthology collection as a source for his picture of Robin Hood in Ivanhoe, written in 1818, which did much to shape the modern legend.[82]\\n In the decades following the publication of Ritson\\'s book, other ballad collections would occasionally publish stray Robin Hood ballads Ritson had missed. In 1806, Robert Jamieson published the earliest known Robin Hood ballad, Robin Hood and the Monk in Volume II of his Popular Ballads and Songs From Tradition. In 1846, the Percy Society included The Bold Pedlar and Robin Hood in its collection, Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England. In 1850, John Mathew Gutch published his own collection of Robin Hood ballads, Robin Hood Garlands and Ballads, with the tale of the lytell Geste, that in addition to all of Ritson\\'s collection, also included Robin Hood and the Pedlars and Robin Hood and the Scotchman.\\n In 1858, Francis James Child published his English and Scottish Ballads which included a volume grouping all the Robin Hood ballads in one volume, including all the ballads published by Ritson, the four stray ballads published since then, as well as some ballads that either mentioned Robin Hood by name or featured characters named Robin Hood but weren\\'t traditional Robin Hood stories. For his more scholarly work, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, in his volume dedicated to the Robin Hood ballads, published in 1888, Child removed the ballads from his earlier work that weren\\'t traditional Robin Hood stories, gave the ballad Ritson titled Robin Hood and the Stranger back its original published title Robin Hood Newly Revived, and separated what Ritson had printed as the second part of Robin Hood and the Stranger as its own separate ballad, Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon. He also included alternate versions of ballads that had distinct, alternate versions. He numbered these 38 Robin Hood ballads among the 305 ballads in his collection as Child Ballads Nos 117–154, which is how they\\'re often referenced in scholarly works.\\n In the 19th century, the Robin Hood legend was first specifically adapted for children. Children\\'s editions of the garlands were produced and in 1820, a children\\'s edition of Ritson\\'s Robin Hood collection was published. Children\\'s novels began to appear shortly thereafter. It is not that children did not read Robin Hood stories before, but this is the first appearance of a Robin Hood literature specifically aimed at them.[83] A very influential example of these children\\'s novels was Pierce Egan the Younger\\'s Robin Hood and Little John (1840).[84][85] This was adapted into French by Alexandre Dumas in Le Prince des Voleurs (1872) and Robin Hood Le Proscrit (1873). Egan made Robin Hood of noble birth but raised by the forestor Gilbert Hood.\\n Another very popular version for children was Howard Pyle\\'s The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, which influenced accounts of Robin Hood through the 20th century.[86] Pyle\\'s version firmly stamp Robin as a staunch philanthropist, a man who takes from the rich to give to the poor. Nevertheless, the adventures are still more local than national in scope: while King Richard\\'s participation in the Crusades is mentioned in passing, Robin takes no stand against Prince John, and plays no part in raising the ransom to free Richard. These developments are part of the 20th-century Robin Hood myth. Pyle\\'s Robin Hood is a yeoman and not an aristocrat.\\n The idea of Robin Hood as a high-minded Saxon fighting Norman lords also originates in the 19th century. The most notable contributions to this idea of Robin are Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry\\'s Histoire de la Conquête de l\\'Angleterre par les Normands (1825) and Sir Walter Scott\\'s Ivanhoe (1819). In this last work in particular, the modern Robin Hood—\\'King of Outlaws and prince of good fellows!\\' as Richard the Lionheart calls him—makes his debut.[87]\\n In 1993, a previously unknown manuscript of 21 Robin Hood ballads (including two versions of \"The Jolly Pinder of Wakefield\") turned up in an auction house and eventually wound up in the British Library. Called The Forresters Manuscript, after the first and last ballads, which are both titled Robin Hood and the Forresters, it was published in 1998 as Robin Hood: The Forresters Manuscript. It appears to have been written in the 1670s.[88] While all the ballads in the Manuscript had already been known and published during the 17th and 18th centuries (although most of the ballads in the Manuscript have different titles then ones they have listed under the Child Ballads), 13 of the ballads in Forresters are noticeably different from how they appeared in the broadsides and garlands. 9 of these ballads are significantly longer and more elaborate than the versions of the same ballads found in the broadsides and garlands. For four of these ballads, the Forresters Manuscript versions are the earliest known versions.\\n The 20th century grafted still further details on to the original legends. The 1938 film The Adventures of Robin Hood, starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, portrayed Robin as a hero on a national scale, leading the oppressed Saxons in revolt against their Norman overlords while Richard the Lionheart fought in the Crusades; this movie established itself so definitively that many studios resorted to movies about his son (invented for that purpose) rather than compete with the image of this one.[89]\\n In 1953, during the McCarthy era, a Republican member of the Indiana Textbook Commission called for a ban of Robin Hood from all Indiana school books for its alleged communist connotations.[90] This proposal prompted a short-lived college protest against McCarthyism and book censorship in the United States that was launched on the Indiana University Bloomington campus and within a course of weeks had grown into a nationwide campus movement, known as the Green Feather Movement.[91]\\n In the 1973 animated Disney film Robin Hood, the title character is portrayed as an anthropomorphic fox voiced by Brian Bedford. Years before Robin Hood had even entered production, Disney had considered doing a project on Reynard the Fox; however, due to concerns that Reynard was unsuitable as a hero, animator Ken Anderson adapted some elements from Reynard into Robin Hood, making the title character a fox.[92]\\n The 1976 British-American film Robin and Marian, starring Sean Connery as Robin Hood and Audrey Hepburn as Maid Marian, portrays the figures in later years after Robin has returned from service with Richard the Lionheart in a foreign crusade and Marian has gone into seclusion in a nunnery. This is the first in popular culture to portray King Richard as less than perfect.\\n Since the 1980s, it has become commonplace to include a Saracen (Arab/Muslim) among the Merry Men, a trend that began with the character Nasir in the 1984 ITV Robin of Sherwood television series. Later versions of the story have followed suit: a version of Nasir appears in the 1991 movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (Azeem) and the 2006 BBC TV series Robin Hood (Djaq).[89] Spoofs have also followed this trend, with the 1990s BBC sitcom Maid Marian and her Merry Men parodying the Moorish character with Barrington, a Rastafarian rapper played by Danny John-Jules,[93] and Mel Brooks comedy Robin Hood: Men in Tights featuring Isaac Hayes as Asneeze and Dave Chappelle as his son Ahchoo. The 2010 movie version Robin Hood, did not include a Saracen character. The 2018 adaptation Robin Hood portrays the character of Little John as a Muslim named Yahya, played by Jamie Foxx.\\n Between 1963 and 1966, French television broadcast a medievalist series entitled Thierry La Fronde (Thierry the Sling). This successful series, which was also shown in Canada, Poland (Thierry Śmiałek), Australia (The King\\'s Outlaw), and the Netherlands (Thierry de Slingeraar), transposes the English Robin Hood narrative into late medieval France during the Hundred Years\\' War.[94]\\n The original ballads and plays, including the early medieval poems and the latter broadside ballads and garlands have been edited and translated for the very first time in French in 2017[95] by Jonathan Fruoco. Until then, the texts had been unavailable in France.\\n The historicity of Robin Hood has been debated for centuries. A difficulty with any such historical research is that Robert was a very common given name in medieval England, and \\'Robin\\' (or Robyn) was its very common diminutive, especially in the 13th century;[96] it is a French hypocorism,[97] already mentioned in the Roman de Renart in the 12th century. The surname Hood (by any spelling) was also fairly common because it referred either to a hooder, who was a maker of hoods, or alternatively to somebody who wore a hood as a head-covering. It is therefore unsurprising that medieval records mention a number of people called \"Robert Hood\" or \"Robin Hood\", some of whom are known criminals.\\n Another view on the origin of the name is expressed in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica which remarks that \"hood\" was a common dialectical form of \"wood\" (compare Dutch hout, hʌut, also meaning \"wood\"), and that the outlaw\\'s name has been given as \"Robin Wood\".[98] There are a number of references to Robin Hood as Robin Wood, or Whood, or Whod, from the 16th and 17th centuries. The earliest recorded example, in connection with May games in Somerset, dates from 1518.[99]\\n The oldest references to Robin Hood are not historical records, or even ballads recounting his exploits, but hints and allusions found in various works. From 1261 onward, the names \"Robinhood\", \"Robehod\", or \"Robbehod\" occur in the rolls of several English Justices as nicknames or descriptions of malefactors. The majority of these references date from the late 13th century. Between 1261 and 1300, there are at least eight references to \"Rabunhod\" in various regions across England, from Berkshire in the south to York in the north.[26]\\n Leaving aside the reference to the \"rhymes\" of Robin Hood in Piers Plowman in the 1370s,[100][101] and the scattered mentions of his \"tales and songs\" in various religious tracts dating to the early 15th century,[3][5][7] the first mention of a quasi-historical Robin Hood is given in Andrew of Wyntoun\\'s Orygynale Chronicle, written in about 1420. The following lines occur with little contextualisation under the year 1283:\\n Lytil Jhon and Robyne Hude\\nWayth-men ware commendyd gude\\nIn Yngil-wode and Barnysdale\\nThai oysyd all this tyme thare trawale.[102]\\n In a petition presented to Parliament in 1439, the name is used to describe an itinerant felon. The petition cites one Piers Venables of Aston, Derbyshire,[a] \"who having no liflode, ne sufficeante of goodes, gadered and assembled unto him many misdoers, beynge of his clothynge, and, in manere of insurrection, wente into the wodes in that countrie, like as it hadde be Robyn Hude and his meyne.\"[103]\\n The next historical description of Robin Hood is a statement in the Scotichronicon, composed by John of Fordun between 1377 and 1384, and revised by Walter Bower in about 1440. Among Bower\\'s many interpolations is a passage that directly refers to Robin. It is inserted after Fordun\\'s account of the defeat of Simon de Montfort and the punishment of his adherents, and is entered under the year 1266 in Bower\\'s account. Robin is represented as a fighter for de Montfort\\'s cause.[104] This was in fact true of the historical outlaw of Sherwood Forest Roger Godberd, whose points of similarity to the Robin Hood of the ballads have often been noted.[105][106]\\n Then arose the famous murderer, Robert Hood, as well as Little John, together with their accomplices from among the disinherited, whom the foolish populace are so inordinately fond of celebrating both in tragedies and comedies, and about whom they are delighted to hear the jesters and minstrels sing above all other ballads.[107] The word translated here as \\'murderer\\' is the Latin sicarius (literally \\'dagger-man\\' but actually meaning, in classical Latin, \\'assassin\\' or \\'murderer\\'), from the Latin sica for \\'dagger\\', and descends from its use to describe the Sicarii, assassins operating in Roman Judea. Bower goes on to relate an anecdote about Robin Hood in which he refuses to flee from his enemies while hearing Mass in the greenwood, and then gains a surprise victory over them, apparently as a reward for his piety; the mention of \"tragedies\" suggests that some form of the tale relating his death, as per A Gest of Robyn Hode, might have been in currency already.[108]\\n Another reference, discovered by Julian Luxford in 2009, appears in the margin of the \"Polychronicon\" in the Eton College library. Written around the year 1460 by a monk in Latin, it says:\\n Around this time [i.e., reign of Edward I], according to popular opinion, a certain outlaw named Robin Hood, with his accomplices, infested Sherwood and other law-abiding areas of England with continuous robberies.[109] Following this, John Major mentions Robin Hood within his Historia Majoris Britanniæ (1521), casting him in a positive light by mentioning his and his followers\\' aversion to bloodshed and ethos of only robbing the wealthy; Major also fixed his floruit not to the mid-13th century but the reigns of Richard I of England and his brother, King John.[52] Richard Grafton, in his Chronicle at Large (1569) went further when discussing Major\\'s description of \"Robert Hood\", identifying him for the first time as a member of the gentry, albeit possibly \"being of a base stock and linaege, was for his manhood and chivalry advanced to the noble dignity of an Earl\" and not the yeomanry, foreshadowing Anthony Munday\\'s casting of him as the dispossessed Earl of Huntingdon.[18] The name nevertheless still had a reputation of sedition and treachery in 1605, when Guy Fawkes and his associates were branded \"Robin Hoods\" by Robert Cecil. In 1644, jurist Edward Coke described Robin Hood as a historical figure who had operated in the reign of King Richard I around Yorkshire; he interpreted the contemporary term \"roberdsmen\" (outlaws) as meaning followers of Robin Hood.[110]\\n The earliest known legal records mentioning a person called Robin Hood (Robert Hod) are from 1226, found in the York Assizes, when that person\\'s goods, worth 32 shillings and 6 pence, were confiscated and he became an outlaw. Robert Hod owed the money to St Peter\\'s in York. The following year, he was called \"Hobbehod\", and also came to known as \"Robert Hood\". Robert Hod of York is the only early Robin Hood known to have been an outlaw. In 1936, L.V.D. Owen floated the idea that Robin Hood might be identified with an outlawed Robert Hood, or Hod, or Hobbehod, all apparently the same man, referred to in nine successive Yorkshire Pipe Rolls between 1226 and 1234.[111][112] There is no evidence however that this Robert Hood, although an outlaw, was also a bandit.[113]\\n Historian Oscar de Ville discusses the career of John Deyville and his brother Robert, along with their kinsmen Jocelin and Adam, during the Second Barons\\' War, specifically their activities after the Battle of Evesham. John Deyville was granted authority by the faction led by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester over York Castle and the Northern Forests during the war in which they sought refuge after Evesham. John, along with his relatives, led the remaining rebel faction on the Isle of Ely following the Dictum of Kenilworth.[114] De Ville connects their presence there with Bower\\'s mention of \"Robert Hood\" during the aftermath of Evesham in his annotations to the Scotichronicon.\\n While John was eventually pardoned and continued his career until 1290, his kinsmen are no longer mentioned by historical records after the events surrounding their resistance at Ely, and de Ville speculates that Robert remained an outlaw. Other points de Ville raises in support of John and his brothers\\' exploits forming the inspiration for Robin Hood include their properties in Barnsdale, John\\'s settlement of a mortgage worth £400 paralleling Robin Hood\\'s charity of identical value to Sir Richard at the Lee, relationship with Sir Richard Foliot, a possible inspiration for the former figure, and ownership of a fortified home at Hood Hill, near Kilburn, North Yorkshire. The last of these is suggested to be the inspiration for Robin Hood\\'s second name as opposed to the more common theory of a head covering.[115] Perhaps not coincidentally, a \"Robertus Hod\" is mentioned in records among the holdouts at Ely.[116]\\n Although de Ville does not explicitly connect John and Robert Deyville to Robin Hood, he discusses these parallels in detail and suggests that they formed prototypes for this ideal of heroic outlawry during the tumultuous reign of Henry III\\'s grandson and Edward I\\'s son, Edward II of England.[117]\\n David Baldwin identifies Robin Hood with the historical outlaw Roger Godberd, who was a die-hard supporter of Simon de Montfort, which would place Robin Hood around the 1260s.[118][119] There are certainly parallels between Godberd\\'s career and that of Robin Hood as he appears in the Gest. John Maddicott has called Godberd \"that prototype Robin Hood\".[120] Some problems with this theory are that there is no evidence that Godberd was ever known as Robin Hood and no sign in the early Robin Hood ballads of the specific concerns of de Montfort\\'s revolt.[121]\\n The antiquarian Joseph Hunter (1783–1861) believed that Robin Hood had inhabited the forests of Yorkshire during the early decades of the fourteenth century. Hunter pointed to two men whom, believing them to be the same person, he identified with the legendary outlaw:\\n Hunter developed a fairly detailed theory implying that Robert Hood had been an adherent of the rebel Earl of Lancaster, who was defeated by Edward II at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322. According to this theory, Robert Hood was thereafter pardoned and employed as a bodyguard by King Edward, and in consequence he appears in the 1323 court roll under the name of \"Robyn Hode\". Hunter\\'s theory has long been recognised to have serious problems, one of the most serious being that recent research has shown that Hunter\\'s Robyn Hood had been employed by the king before he appeared in the 1323 court roll, thus casting doubt on this Robyn Hood\\'s supposed earlier career as outlaw and rebel.[122]\\n It has long been suggested, notably by John Maddicott, that \"Robin Hood\" was a stock alias used by thieves.[123] What appears to be the first known example of \"Robin Hood\" as a stock name for an outlaw dates to 1262 in Berkshire, where the surname \"Robehod\" was applied to a man apparently because he had been outlawed.[124] This could suggest two main possibilities: either that an early form of the Robin Hood legend was already well established in the mid-13th century; or alternatively that the name \"Robin Hood\" preceded the outlaw hero that we know; so that the \"Robin Hood\" of legend was so called because that was seen as an appropriate name for an outlaw.\\n There is at present little or no scholarly support for the view that tales of Robin Hood have stemmed from mythology or folklore, from fairies or other mythological origins, any such associations being regarded as later development.[125][126] It was once a popular view, however.[98] The \"mythological theory\" dates back at least to 1584, when Reginald Scot identified Robin Hood with the Germanic goblin \"Hudgin\" or Hodekin and associated him with Robin Goodfellow.[127] Maurice Keen[128] provides a brief summary and useful critique of the evidence for the view Robin Hood had mythological origins. While the outlaw often shows great skill in archery, swordplay and disguise, his feats are no more exaggerated than those of characters in other ballads, such as Kinmont Willie, which were based on historical events.[129]\\n Robin Hood has also been claimed for the pagan witch-cult supposed by Margaret Murray to have existed in medieval Europe, and his anti-clericalism and Marianism interpreted in this light.[130] The existence of the witch cult as proposed by Murray is now generally discredited.\\n \\nThe early ballads link Robin Hood to identifiable real places. In popular culture, Robin Hood and his band of \"merry men\" are portrayed as living in Sherwood Forest, in Nottinghamshire.[131] Notably, the Lincoln Cathedral Manuscript, which is the first officially recorded Robin Hood song (dating from approximately 1420), makes an explicit reference to the outlaw that states that \"Robyn hode in scherewode stod\".[132] In a similar fashion, a monk of Witham Priory (1460) suggested that the archer had \\'infested shirwode\\'. His chronicle entry reads:  Around this time, according to popular opinion, a certain outlaw named Robin Hood, with his accomplices, infested Sherwood and other law-abiding areas of England with continuous robberies\\'.[133] Specific sites in the county of Nottinghamshire directly linked to the Robin Hood legend include Robin Hood\\'s Well, near Newstead Abbey (within the boundaries of Sherwood Forest), the Church of St. Mary in the village of Edwinstowe and most famously of all, the Major Oak also in the village of Edwinstowe.[135] The Major Oak, which resides in the heart of Sherwood Forest, is popularly believed to have been used by the Merry Men as a hide-out. Dendrologists have contradicted this claim by estimating the tree\\'s true age at around eight hundred years; it would have been relatively a sapling in Robin\\'s time, at best.[136]\\n Nottinghamshire\\'s claim to Robin Hood\\'s heritage is disputed, with Yorkists staking a claim to the outlaw. In demonstrating Yorkshire\\'s Robin Hood heritage, the historian J. C. Holt drew attention to the fact that although Sherwood Forest is mentioned in Robin Hood and the Monk, there is little information about the topography of the region, and thus suggested that Robin Hood was drawn to Nottinghamshire through his interactions with the city\\'s sheriff.[137] Moreover, the linguist Lister Matheson has observed that the language of the Gest of Robyn Hode is written in a definite northern dialect, probably that of Yorkshire.[138] In consequence, it seems probable that the Robin Hood legend actually originates from the county of Yorkshire. Robin Hood\\'s Yorkshire origins are generally accepted by professional historians.[139]\\n A tradition dating back at least to the end of the 16th century gives Robin Hood\\'s birthplace as Loxley, Sheffield, in South Yorkshire. The original Robin Hood ballads, which originate from the fifteenth century, set events in the medieval forest of Barnsdale. Barnsdale was a wooded area covering an expanse of no more than thirty square miles, ranging six miles from north to south, with the River Went at Wentbridge near Pontefract forming its northern boundary and the villages of Skelbrooke and Hampole forming the southernmost region. From east to west the forest extended about five miles, from Askern on the east to Badsworth in the west.[140] At the northernmost edge of the forest of Barnsdale, in the heart of the Went Valley, resides the village of Wentbridge. Wentbridge is a village in the City of Wakefield district of West Yorkshire, England. It lies around 3 miles (5\\xa0km) southeast of its nearest township of size, Pontefract, close to the A1 road. During the medieval age Wentbridge was sometimes locally referred to by the name of Barnsdale because it was the predominant settlement in the forest.[141] Wentbridge is mentioned in an early Robin Hood ballad, entitled, Robin Hood and the Potter, which reads, \"Y mete hem bot at Went breg,\\' syde Lyttyl John\". And, while Wentbridge is not directly named in A Gest of Robyn Hode, the poem does appear to make a cryptic reference to the locality by depicting a poor knight explaining to Robin Hood that he \\'went at a bridge\\' where there was wrestling\\'.[142] A commemorative Blue Plaque has been placed on the bridge that crosses the River Went by Wakefield City Council.\\n The Gest makes a specific reference to the Saylis at Wentbridge. Credit is due to the nineteenth-century antiquarian Joseph Hunter, who correctly identified the site of the Saylis.[143] From this location it was once possible to look out over the Went Valley and observe the traffic that passed along the Great North Road. The Saylis is recorded as having contributed towards the aid that was granted to Edward III in 1346–47 for the knighting of the Black Prince. An acre of landholding is listed within a glebe terrier of 1688 relating to Kirk Smeaton, which later came to be called \"Sailes Close\".[144] Professor Dobson and Mr. Taylor indicate that such evidence of continuity makes it virtually certain that the Saylis that was so well known to Robin Hood is preserved today as \"Sayles Plantation\".[145] It is this location that provides a vital clue to Robin Hood\\'s Yorkshire heritage. One final locality in the forest of Barnsdale that is associated with Robin Hood is the village of Campsall.\\n The historian John Paul Davis wrote of Robin\\'s connection to the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene at Campsall in South Yorkshire.[146] A Gest of Robyn Hode states that the outlaw built a chapel in Barnsdale that he dedicated to Mary Magdalene:\\n I made a chapel in Bernysdale,\\nThat seemly is to se,\\nIt is of Mary Magdaleyne,\\nAnd thereto wolde I be.[147]\\n Davis indicates that there is only one church dedicated to Mary Magdalene within what one might reasonably consider to have been the medieval forest of Barnsdale, and that is the church at Campsall. The church was built in the early twelfth century by Robert de Lacy, the 2nd Baron of Pontefract.[148][149] Local legend suggests that Robin Hood and Maid Marion were married at the church.\\n The backdrop of St Mary\\'s Abbey, York plays a central role in the Gest as the poor knight whom Robin aids owes money to the abbot.\\n At Kirklees Priory in West Yorkshire stands an alleged grave with a spurious inscription, which relates to Robin Hood. The fifteenth-century ballads relate that before he died, Robin told Little John where to bury him. He shot an arrow from the Priory window, and where the arrow landed was to be the site of his grave. The Gest states that the Prioress was a relative of Robin\\'s. Robin was ill and staying at the Priory where the Prioress was supposedly caring for him. However, she betrayed him, his health worsened, and he eventually died there. The inscription on the grave reads,\\n Hear underneath dis laitl stean\\nLaz robert earl of Huntingtun\\nNe\\'er arcir ver as hie sa geud\\nAn pipl kauld im robin heud\\nSick [such] utlawz as he an iz men\\nVil england nivr si agen\\nObiit 24 kal: Dekembris, 1247\\n Despite the unconventional spelling, the verse is in Modern English, not the Middle English of the 13th century.  The date is also incorrectly formatted – using the Roman calendar, \"24 kal Decembris\" would be the twenty-third day before the beginning of December, that is, 8 November.  The tomb probably dates from the late eighteenth century.[150]\\n The grave with the inscription is within sight of the ruins of the Kirklees Priory, behind the Three Nuns pub in Mirfield, West Yorkshire. Though local folklore suggests that Robin is buried in the grounds of Kirklees Priory, this theory has now largely been abandoned by professional historians.\\n Another theory is that Robin Hood died at Kirkby, Pontefract. Michael Drayton\\'s Poly-Olbion Song 28 (67–70), published in 1622, speaks of Robin Hood\\'s death and clearly states that the outlaw died at \\'Kirkby\\'.[151] This is consistent with the view that Robin Hood operated in the Went Valley, located three miles to the southeast of the town of Pontefract. The location is approximately three miles from the site of Robin\\'s robberies at the now famous Saylis. In the Anglo-Saxon period, Kirkby was home to All Saints\\' Church, Pontefract. All Saints\\' Church had a priory hospital attached to it. The Tudor historian Richard Grafton stated that the prioress who murdered Robin Hood buried the outlaw beside the road,\\n Where he had used to rob and spoyle those that passed that way ... and the cause why she buryed him there was, for that common strangers and travailers, knowing and seeing him there buryed, might more safely and without feare take their journeys that way, which they durst not do in the life of the sayd outlaes.[152] All Saints\\' Church at Kirkby, modern Pontefract, which was located approximately three miles from the site of Robin Hood\\'s robberies at the Saylis, is consistent with Richard Grafton\\'s description because a road ran directly from Wentbridge to the hospital at Kirkby.[153]\\n Within close proximity of Wentbridge reside several notable landmarks relating to Robin Hood. One such place-name location occurred in a cartulary deed of 1422 from Monkbretton Priory, which makes direct reference to a landmark named Robin Hood\\'s Stone, which resided upon the eastern side of the Great North Road, a mile south of Barnsdale Bar.[154] The historians Barry Dobson and John Taylor suggested that on the opposite side of the road once stood Robin Hood\\'s Well, which has since been relocated six miles north-west of Doncaster, on the south-bound side of the Great North Road. Over the next three centuries, the name popped-up all over the place, such as at Robin Hood\\'s Bay, near Whitby in Yorkshire, Robin Hood\\'s Butts in Cumbria, and Robin Hood\\'s Walk at Richmond, Surrey.\\n Robin Hood type place-names occurred particularly everywhere except Sherwood. The first place-name in Sherwood does not appear until the year 1700.[155] The fact that the earliest Robin Hood type place-names originated in West Yorkshire is deemed to be historically significant because, generally, place-name evidence originates from the locality where legends begin.[156] The overall picture from the surviving early ballads and other early references[157] indicate that Robin Hood was based in the Barnsdale area of what is now South Yorkshire, which borders Nottinghamshire.\\n The Sheriff of Nottingham also had jurisdiction in Derbyshire that was known as the \"Shire of the Deer\", and this is where the Royal Forest of the Peak is found, which roughly corresponds to today\\'s Peak District National Park. The Royal Forest included Bakewell, Tideswell, Castleton, Ladybower and the Derwent Valley near Loxley. The Sheriff of Nottingham possessed property near Loxley, among other places both far and wide including Hazlebadge Hall, Peveril Castle and Haddon Hall. Mercia, to which Nottingham belonged, came to within three miles of Sheffield City Centre. But before the Law of the Normans was the Law of the Danes, The Danelaw had a similar boundary to that of Mercia but had a population of Free Peasantry that were known to have resisted the Norman occupation. Many outlaws could have been created by the refusal to recognise Norman Forest Law.[158] The supposed grave of Little John can be found in Hathersage, also in the Peak District.\\n Further indications of the legend\\'s connection with West Yorkshire (and particularly Calderdale) are noted in the fact that there are pubs called the Robin Hood in both nearby Brighouse and at Cragg Vale; higher up in the Pennines beyond Halifax, where Robin Hood Rocks can also be found. Robin Hood Hill is near Outwood, West Yorkshire, not far from Lofthouse. There is a village in West Yorkshire called Robin Hood, on the A61 between Leeds and Wakefield and close to Rothwell and Lofthouse. Considering these references to Robin Hood, it is not surprising that the people of both South and West Yorkshire lay some claim to Robin Hood, who, if he existed, could easily have roamed between Nottingham, Lincoln, Doncaster and right into West Yorkshire.\\n A British Army Territorial (reserves) battalion formed in Nottingham in 1859 was known as The Robin Hood Battalion through various reorganisations until the \"Robin Hood\" name finally disappeared in 1992. With the 1881 Childers Reforms that linked regular and reserve units into regimental families, the Robin Hood Battalion became part of The Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment).\\n A Neolithic causewayed enclosure on Salisbury Plain has acquired the name Robin Hood\\'s Ball, although had Robin Hood existed it is doubtful that he would have travelled so far south.\\n Ballads dating back to the 15th century are the oldest existing form of the Robin Hood legends, although none of them were recorded at the time of the first allusions to him, and many are from much later. They share many common features, often opening with praise of the greenwood and relying heavily on disguise as a plot device, but include a wide variation in tone and plot.[159] The ballads are sorted into four groups, very roughly according to date of first known free-standing copy. Ballads whose first recorded version appears (usually incomplete) in the Percy Folio may appear in later versions[160] and may be much older than the mid-17th century when the Folio was compiled. Any ballad may be older than the oldest copy that happens to survive, or descended from a lost older ballad. For example, the plot of Robin Hood\\'s Death, found in the Percy Folio, is summarised in the 15th-century A Gest of Robyn Hode, and it also appears in an 18th-century version.[161]\\n NB. The first two ballads listed here (the \"Death\" and \"Gisborne\"), although preserved in 17th-century copies, are generally agreed to preserve the substance of late medieval ballads. The third (the \"Curtal Friar\") and the fourth (the \"Butcher\"), also probably have late medieval origins.[162] An * before a ballad\\'s title indicates there\\'s also a version of this ballad in the Forresters Manuscript.\\n NB: An * before a ballad\\'s title indicates that the Forresters version of this ballad is the earliest known version.\\n Some ballads, such as Erlinton, feature Robin Hood in some variants, where the folk hero appears to be added to a ballad pre-existing him and in which he does not fit very well.[163] He was added to one variant of Rose Red and the White Lily, apparently on no more connection than that one hero of the other variants is named \"Brown Robin\".[164] Francis James Child indeed retitled Child ballad 102; though it was titled The Birth of Robin Hood, its clear lack of connection with the Robin Hood cycle (and connection with other, unrelated ballads) led him to title it Willie and Earl Richard\\'s Daughter in his collection.[165]\\n Then Robyn goes to Notyngham,\\nHym selfe mornyng allone,\\nAnd Litull John to mery Scherwode,\\nThe pathes he knew ilkone.', 'Hua Mulan (Chinese: 花木蘭) is a legendary Chinese folk heroine from the Northern and Southern dynasties era (4th to 6th century CE) of Chinese history. Scholars generally consider Mulan to be a fictional character. Hua Mulan is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (無雙譜, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang.[citation needed]\\n According to legend, Mulan took her aged father\\'s place in the conscription for the army by disguising herself as a man. In the story, after prolonged and distinguished military service against nomadic hordes beyond the northern frontier, Mulan is honored by the emperor but declines a position of high office. She retires to her hometown, where she is reunited with her family and, much to the astonishment of her comrades, reveals herself as a woman.\\n The first written record of Mulan is the Ballad of Mulan,[note 1] a folk song believed to have been composed during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–535 CE) and included in an anthology of books and songs during the Southern Chen dynasty (557–589 CE). While this anthology is itself lost, significant excerpts, including the Ballad of Mulan, survive in the Song dynasty anthology Yuefu Shiji\\u200a\\xa0[zh; ko; ja] (Chinese: 乐府诗集).[note 2]\\n The historical setting of the Ballad of Mulan is usually the Northern Wei\\'s military campaigns against the nomadic Rouran. A later adaptation has Mulan active around the founding of the Tang dynasty (c.\\u2009620 CE).[1]\\n The story of Mulan was taken up in a number of later works, including the 17th-century work of historical fiction Romance of Sui and Tang\\xa0[zh],[note 3] and many screen and stage adaptations.\\n The Ballad of Mulan was first transcribed in the Musical Records of Old and New,[note 4] a compilation of books and songs by the monk Zhijiang in the Southern Chen dynasty in the 6th century. The earliest extant text of the poem comes from an 11th- or 12th-century anthology known as the Music Bureau Collection,[note 5] whose author, Guo Maoqian, explicitly mentions the Musical Records of Old and New as his source for the poem. As a ballad, the lines do not necessarily have equal numbers of syllables. The poem consists of 31 couplets and is mostly composed of five-character phrases, with a few extending to seven or nine.[citation needed]\\n An adaptation by playwright Xu Wei (d. 1593) dramatized the tale as \"The Female Mulan\" [note 6] or, more fully, \"The Heroine Mulan Goes to War in Her Father\\'s Place\",[note 7] in two acts.[2][3] Later, the character of Mulan was incorporated into the Romance of Sui and Tang, a novel written by Chu Renhuo (褚人獲).[4][5]\\n Over time, the story of Mulan rose in popularity as a folk tale among the Chinese people.[citation needed]\\n The heroine of the poem is given different family names in different versions of her story. The Musical Records of Old and New states Mulan\\'s given name is not known and therefore implies Mulan is her surname.[6] As the Ballad of Mulan is set in the Northern Wei dynasty when northern China was ruled by ethnic Xianbei, a proto-Mongolic people, there is some evidence that Mulan was not ethnic Han Chinese but Xianbei, who had exclusively compound surnames.[6] Mulan may have been the sinified version of the Xianbei word \"umran\" which means prosperous.[6]\\n According to later books such as Female Mulan, her family name is Zhu (朱), while the Romance of Sui and Tang says it is Wei (魏). The family name Hua (花; Huā; \\'flower\\'), which was introduced by Xu Wei,[2] has become the most popular in recent years, in part because of its more poetic meaning and association with the given name \"Mulan\" (木蘭), which literally means \"magnolia\".[citation needed]\\n Mulan\\'s name is included in Yan Xiyuan\\'s One Hundred Beauties, which describes a number of women from Chinese folklore. It is still unclear whether Mulan was a historical person or just a legend, as her name does not appear in Exemplary Women, a collection of biographies of women who lived during  Northern Wei dynasty.[7]\\n Although The Ballad of Mulan itself does not expressly indicate the historical setting, the story is commonly attributed to the Northern Wei dynasty due to geographic and cultural references in the ballad.[6] The Northern Wei dynasty was founded by the Tuoba clan of ethnic Xianbei who united northern China in the 4th century CE (Conquest dynasty). The Tuoba Xianbei rulers were themselves nomads from the northern steppes and became sinified as they ruled and settled in northern China.[6] The Tuoba Xianbei took on the Chinese dynasty name \"Wei\", changed their own surname from \"Tuoba\" to \"Yuan\", and moved the capital from Pingcheng, modern-day Datong, Shanxi in the northern periphery of Imperial China, to Luoyang, south of the Yellow River, in the Central Plain, the traditional heartland of China.[6] The emperors of the Northern Wei were known both by the sacred Chinese title, \"Son of Heaven\", and by \"Khagan\", the title of the leader of nomadic kingdoms. The Ballad of Mulan refers to the sovereign by both titles. The Northern Wei also adopted the governing institutions of Imperial China, and the office of shangshulang (尚書郎) the Khagan offered Mulan is a ministerial position within the shangshusheng (尚書省), the highest organ of executive power under the emperor.[8] This offering indicates Mulan was trained in the martial arts and literary arts as she was capable of serving as a civilian official charged with issuing and interpreting written government orders.[citation needed]\\n The Xianbei in China also retained certain nomadic traditions, and Xianbei women were typically skilled horseback riders.[6] Another popular Northern Wei folk poem called \"Li Bo\\'s Younger Sister\" praises Yong Rong, Li Bo\\'s younger sister, for her riding and archery skills.[6] The Ballad of Mulan may have reflected the gender roles and status of women in nomadic societies.[9]\\n The Northern Wei was engaged in protracted military conflict with the nomadic Rouran, who frequently raided the northern Chinese frontier to loot and pillage.[6] Northern Wei emperors considered the Rouran to be uncivilized \"barbarians\" and called them Ruanruan (Chinese: 蠕蠕) or \"wriggling worms\".[10] According to the Book of Wei, the dynasty\\'s official history, Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei launched a military expedition in 429 against the Rouran by advancing on the Black Mountain and then extending northward to the Yanran Mountain.[6] Both locations are cited in The Ballad. The Black Mountain corresponds to Shahu Mountain (殺虎山), located southeast of modern-day Hohhot in Inner Mongolia. Yan Mountain, the shorthand for Yanran Mountain (燕然山), is now known as the Khangai Mountains of central Mongolia.[10]\\n The Northern Wei sought to protect the frontier by establishing a string of frontier garrison commands across what is today Inner Mongolia.[citation needed]\\n Mulan sighs at her loom.[11][12] The Khagan is mobilizing the military, and her father is named in each of the conscription notices from the emperor. As the eldest child, she decides to take her father\\'s place. She buys a fine horse from the eastern market, saddle and stirrup from the western market, bridle and reins from the southern market and a long whip from the northern market.\\n She bids farewell to her parents in the morning and leaves for the Black Mountain, encamping by the Yellow River in the evening, where she cannot hear the calls of her parents due to the rushing waters; only the sounds of the barbarians\\' cavalry in the Yan Mountains. She advances ten thousand li to battle as if flying past the mountains. The sound of the sentry gong cuts through the cold night air, and the moonlight reflects off her metal armor. A hundred battles take place, and generals die.\\n After the ten-year campaign, the veterans return to meet the Son of Heaven (Mandate of Heaven), enthroned in the splendid palace, who confers promotions in rank and prizes of hundreds of thousands. He asks Mulan what she would like. Mulan turns down the high-ranking position of shangshulang in the central government, and asks only for a speedy steed to take her home.\\n Her parents, upon hearing her return, welcome her outside their hometown. Her elder sister puts on her fine dress. Her younger brother sharpens the knife for the swine and sheep. Mulan returns to her room, changes from her tabard into her old clothes. She combs her hair by the window and, before the mirror, fastens golden yellow flowers. Her comrades are shocked to see her. For twelve years of their enlistment together, they hadn\\'t realized that she was a woman.\\n In response, Mulan explains. \"The male hare has heavy front paws. The female hare tends to squint. But when they are running side-by-side close to the ground, who can tell me which is male or female?\"[13][14]\\n Chu Renhuo\\'s Romance of the Sui and Tang\\xa0[zh] (c. 1675) provides additional backdrops and plot-twists.[4] Here, Mulan lives under the rule of Heshana Khan of the Western Turkic Khaganate. When the Khan agrees to wage war in alliance with the emergent Tang dynasty, which was poised to conquer all of China, Mulan\\'s father Hua Hu (Chinese: 花弧) fears he will be conscripted into military service since he only has two daughters and an infant son. Mulan crossdresses as a man and enlists in her father\\'s stead. She is intercepted by the forces of the Xia king Dou Jiande and is brought under questioning by the king\\'s warrior daughter Xianniang (Chinese: 線娘), who tries to recruit Mulan as a man. Discovering Mulan to be a fellow female warrior, she is so delighted that they become sworn sisters.[5][15]\\n In the Sui Tang Romance, Mulan comes to a tragic end, a \"detail that cannot be found in any previous legends or stories associated Hua Mulan\", and believed to have been interpolated by the author Chu Renho.[5] Xianniang\\'s father is vanquished after siding with the enemy of the Tang dynasty, and the two sworn sisters, with knives in their mouths, surrender themselves to be executed in the place of the condemned man. This act of filial piety wins a reprieve from Emperor Taizong of Tang, and the imperial consort, who was birth-mother to the Emperor, bestows money to Mulan to provide for her parents, as well as wedding funds for the princess, who had confessed to having promised herself to general Luó Chéng\\xa0[zh] (Chinese: 羅成).[16] In reality, Dou Jiande was executed, but in the novel he lives on as a monk.[citation needed]\\n Mulan is given leave to journey back to her homeland, and once arrangements were made for Mulan\\'s parents to relocate, it is expected that they will all be living in the princess\\'s old capital of Leshou (Chinese: 樂壽, modern Xian County, Hebei). Mulan is devastated to discover her father has long died and her mother has remarried. According to the novel, Mulan\\'s mother was surnamed Yuan (袁) and remarried a man named Wei (魏). Even worse, the Khan has summoned her to the palace to become his concubine.[17]\\n Rather than to suffer this fate, she dies by suicide. But before she dies, she entrusts an errand to her younger sister, Youlan (Chinese: 又蘭), which was to deliver Xianniang\\'s letter to her fiancé, Luó Chéng. This younger sister dresses as a man to make her delivery, but her disguise is discovered, and it arouses her recipient\\'s amorous attention.[18]\\n The Mulan character\\'s suicide has been described as \"baffling\", since she is not in love or engaged to anyone.  Some commentators have explained this as an anti-Qing message: the author supposedly wanted to suggest that \"even a half-Chinese woman would prefer death by her own hand to serving a foreign ruler\".[17] In the novel, Mulan\\'s mother was from the Central Plain of China, but her father was from Hebei during the Northern Wei dynasty[19] and presumably of Turkic (Xianbei) origin, which would make her only half-Chinese.[17]\\n The story of Hua Mulan has inspired a number of screen and stage adaptations.\\n The Hua Mulan crater on Venus is named for her.[28][29]', 'Pocahontas (US: /ˌpoʊkəˈhɒntəs/ ⓘ, UK: /ˌpɒk-/; born Amonute,[1] also known as Matoaka and Rebecca Rolfe; c. 1596 – March 1617) was a Native American woman belonging to the Powhatan people, notable for her association with the colonial settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. She was the daughter of Powhatan, the paramount chief[2] of a network of tributary tribes in the Tsenacommacah, encompassing the Tidewater region of what is today the U.S. state of Virginia.\\n Pocahontas was captured and held for ransom by English colonists during hostilities in 1613. During her captivity, she was encouraged to convert to Christianity and was baptized under the name Rebecca. She married the tobacco planter John Rolfe in April 1614 at the age of about 17 or 18, and she bore their son, Thomas Rolfe, in January 1615.[1]\\n In 1616, the Rolfes travelled to London, where Pocahontas was presented to English society as an example of the \"civilized savage\" in hopes of stimulating investment in Jamestown. On this trip she may have met Squanto, a Patuxet man from New England.[3] Pocahontas became a celebrity, was elegantly fêted, and attended a masque at Whitehall Palace. In 1617, the Rolfes intended to sail for Virginia, but Pocahontas died at Gravesend, Kent, England, of unknown causes, aged 20 or 21. She was buried in St George\\'s Church, Gravesend; her grave\\'s exact location is unknown because the church was rebuilt after being destroyed by a fire.[1]\\n Numerous places, landmarks, and products in the United States have been named after Pocahontas. Her story has been romanticized over the years, many aspects of which are fictional. Many of the stories told about her by the English explorer John Smith have been contested by her documented descendants.[4] She is a subject of art, literature, and film. Many famous people have claimed to be among her descendants, including members of the First Families of Virginia, First Lady Edith Wilson, American actor Glenn Strange, and astronomer Percival Lowell.[5]\\n Pocahontas\\'s birth year is unknown, but some historians estimate it to have been around 1596.[1] In A True Relation of Virginia (1608), the English explorer John Smith described meeting Pocahontas in the spring of 1608 when she was \"a child of ten years old\".[6] In a 1616 letter, Smith again described her as she was in 1608, but this time as \"a child of twelve or thirteen years of age\".[7]\\n Pocahontas was the daughter of Chief Powhatan, paramount chief of Tsenacommacah, an alliance of about thirty Algonquian-speaking groups and petty chiefdoms in the Tidewater region of the present-day U.S. state of Virginia.[8] Her mother\\'s name and origin are unknown, but she was probably of lowly status. English adventurer Henry Spelman had lived among the Powhatan people as an interpreter, and he noted that, when one of the paramount chief\\'s many wives gave birth, she was returned to her place of origin and supported there by the paramount chief until she found another husband.[9] However, little is known about Pocahontas\\'s mother, and it has been theorized that she died in childbirth.[10] The Mattaponi Reservation people are descendants of the Powhatans, and their oral tradition claims that Pocahontas\\'s mother was the first wife of Powhatan and that Pocahontas was named after her.[11]\\n According to colonist William Strachey, \"Pocahontas\" was a childhood nickname meaning \"little wanton\".[12] Some interpret the meaning as \"playful one\".[13] In his account, Strachey describes Pocahontas as a child visiting the fort at Jamestown and playing with the young boys; she would \"get the boys forth with her into the marketplace and make them wheel, falling on their hands, turning up their heels upwards, whom she would follow and wheel so herself, naked as she was, all the fort over\".[14]\\n Historian William Stith claimed that \"her real name, it seems, was originally Matoax, which the Native Americans carefully concealed from the English and changed it to Pocahontas, out of a superstitious fear, lest they, by the knowledge of her true name, should be enabled to do her some hurt.\"[15] According to anthropologist Helen C. Rountree, Pocahontas revealed her secret name to the colonists \"only after she had taken another religious – baptismal – name\" of Rebecca.[16]\\n Pocahontas is frequently viewed as a princess in popular culture. In 1841, William Watson Waldron of Trinity College, Dublin, published Pocahontas, American Princess: and Other Poems, calling her \"the beloved and only surviving daughter of the king\".[17] She was her father\\'s \"delight and darling\", according to colonist Captain Ralph Hamor,[18] but she was not in line to inherit a position as a weroance, sub-chief, or mamanatowick (paramount chief). Instead, Powhatan\\'s brothers and sisters and his sisters\\' children all stood in line to succeed him.[19] In his A Map of Virginia, John Smith explained how matrilineal inheritance worked among the Powhatans:\\n His kingdom descendeth not to his sonnes nor children: but first to his brethren, whereof he hath three namely Opitchapan, Opechanncanough, and Catataugh; and after their decease to his sisters. First to the eldest sister, then to the rest: and after them to the heires male and female of the eldest sister; but never to the heires of the males. Pocahontas is most famously linked to colonist John Smith, who arrived in Virginia with 100 other settlers in April 1607. The colonists built a fort on a marshy peninsula on the James River, and had numerous encounters over the next several months with the people of Tsenacommacah – some of them friendly, some hostile.\\n A hunting party led by Powhatan\\'s close relative Opechancanough captured Smith in December 1607 while he was exploring on the Chickahominy River and brought him to Powhatan\\'s capital at Werowocomoco. In his 1608 account, Smith describes a great feast followed by a long talk with Powhatan. He does not mention Pocahontas in relation to his capture, and claims that they first met some months later.[20][21] Margaret Huber suggests that Powhatan was attempting to bring Smith and the other colonists under his own authority. He offered Smith rule of the town of Capahosic, which was close to his capital at Werowocomoco, as he hoped to keep Smith and his men \"nearby and better under control\".[22]\\n In 1616, Smith wrote a letter to Queen Anne of Denmark, the wife of King James, in anticipation of Pocahontas\\' visit to England. In this new account, his capture included the threat of his own death: \"at the minute of my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to Jamestown.\"[7] He expanded on this in his 1624 Generall Historie, published seven years after the death of Pocahontas. He explained that he was captured and taken to the paramount chief where \"two great stones were brought before Powhatan: then as many as could layd hands on him [Smith], dragged him to them, and thereon laid his head, and being ready with their clubs, to beate out his braines, Pocahontas the Kings dearest daughter, when no intreaty could prevaile, got his head in her armes, and laid her owne upon his to save him from death.\"[23]\\n Karen Ordahl Kupperman suggests that Smith used such details to embroider his first account, thus producing a more dramatic second account of his encounter with Pocahontas as a heroine worthy of Queen Anne\\'s audience. She argues that its later revision and publication was Smith\\'s attempt to raise his own stock and reputation, as he had fallen from favor with the London Company which had funded the Jamestown enterprise.[24] Anthropologist Frederic W. Gleach suggests that Smith\\'s second account was substantially accurate but represents his misunderstanding of a three-stage ritual intended to adopt him into the confederacy,[25][26] but not all writers are convinced, some suggesting the absence of certain corroborating evidence.[4]\\n Early histories did establish that Pocahontas befriended Smith and the colonists. She often went to the settlement and played games with the boys there.[14] When the colonists were starving, \"every once in four or five days, Pocahontas with her attendants brought [Smith] so much provision that saved many of their lives that else for all this had starved with hunger.\"[27] As the colonists expanded their settlement, the Powhatans felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again. In late 1609, an injury from a gunpowder explosion forced Smith to return to England for medical care and the colonists told the Powhatans that he was dead. Pocahontas believed that account and stopped visiting Jamestown but learned that Smith was living in England when she traveled there with her husband John Rolfe.[28]\\n Pocahontas\\' capture occurred in the context of the First Anglo-Powhatan War, a conflict between the Jamestown settlers and the Natives which began late in the summer of 1609.[30] In the first years of war, the colonists took control of the James River, both at its mouth and at the falls. In the meantime, Captain Samuel Argall pursued contacts with Native tribes in the northern portion of Powhatan\\'s paramount chiefdom. The Patawomecks lived on the Potomac River and were not always loyal to Powhatan, and living with them was Henry Spelman, a young English interpreter. In March 1613, Argall learned that Pocahontas was visiting the Patawomeck village of Passapatanzy and living under the protection of the weroance Iopassus (also known as Japazaws).[31]\\n With Spelman\\'s help translating, Argall pressured Iopassus to assist in Pocahontas\\' capture by promising an alliance with the colonists against the Powhatans.[31] Iopassus, with the help of his wives, tricked Pocahontas into boarding Argall\\'s ship and held her for ransom, demanding the release of colonial prisoners held by her father and the return of various stolen weapons and tools.[32] Powhatan returned the prisoners but failed to satisfy the colonists with the number of weapons and tools that he returned. A long standoff ensued, during which the colonists kept Pocahontas captive.[citation needed]\\n During the year-long wait, Pocahontas was held at the English settlement of Henricus in present-day Chesterfield County, Virginia. Little is known about her life there, although colonist Ralph Hamor wrote that she received \"extraordinary courteous usage\".[33] Linwood \"Little Bear\" Custalow refers to an oral tradition which claims that Pocahontas was raped; Helen Rountree counters that \"other historians have disputed that such oral tradition survived and instead argue that any mistreatment of Pocahontas would have gone against the interests of the English in their negotiations with Powhatan. A truce had been called, the Indians still far outnumbered the English, and the colonists feared retaliation.\"[34] At this time, Henricus minister Alexander Whitaker taught Pocahontas about Christianity and helped her improve her English. Upon her baptism, she took the Christian name \"Rebecca.\"[35]\\n In March 1614, the stand-off escalated to a violent confrontation between hundreds of colonists and Powhatan men on the Pamunkey River, and the colonists encountered a group of senior Native leaders at Powhatan\\'s capital of Matchcot. The colonists allowed Pocahontas to talk to her tribe when Powhatan arrived, and she reportedly rebuked him for valuing her \"less than old swords, pieces, or axes\". She said that she preferred to live with the colonists \"who loved her\".[36]\\n Mattaponi tradition holds that Pocahontas\\' first husband was Kocoum, brother of the Patawomeck weroance Japazaws, and that Kocoum was killed by the colonists after his wife\\'s capture in 1613.[37] Today\\'s Patawomecks believe that Pocahontas and Kocoum had a daughter named Ka-Okee who was raised by the Patawomecks after her father\\'s death and her mother\\'s abduction.[38]\\n Kocoum\\'s identity, location, and very existence have been widely debated among scholars for centuries; the only mention of a \"Kocoum\" in any English document is a brief statement written about 1616 by William Strachey that Pocahontas had been living married to a \"private captaine called Kocoum\" for two years.[39] Pocahontas married John Rolfe in 1614, and no other records even hint at any previous husband, so some have suggested that Strachey was mistakenly referring to Rolfe himself, with the reference being later misunderstood as one of Powhatan\\'s officers.[40]\\n During her stay at Henricus, Pocahontas met John Rolfe. Rolfe\\'s English-born wife Sarah Hacker and child Bermuda had died on the way to Virginia after the wreck of the ship Sea Venture on the Summer Isles, now known as Bermuda. He established the Virginia plantation Varina Farms, where he cultivated a new strain of tobacco. Rolfe was a pious man and agonized over the potential moral repercussions of marrying a heathen, though in fact Pocahontas had accepted the Christian faith and taken the baptismal name Rebecca. In a long letter to the governor requesting permission to wed her, he expressed his love for Pocahontas and his belief that he would be saving her soul. He wrote that he was:\\n motivated not by the unbridled desire of carnal affection, but for the good of this plantation, for the honor of our country, for the Glory of God, for my own salvation... namely Pocahontas, to whom my hearty and best thoughts are, and have been a long time so entangled, and enthralled in so intricate a labyrinth that I was even a-wearied to unwind myself thereout.[41] The couple were married on April 5, 1614, by chaplain Richard Buck, probably at Jamestown. For two years they lived at Varina Farms, across the James River from Henricus. Their son, Thomas, was born in January 1615.[42]\\n The marriage created a climate of peace between the Jamestown colonists and Powhatan\\'s tribes; it endured for eight years as the \"Peace of Pocahontas\".[43] In 1615, Ralph Hamor wrote, \"Since the wedding we have had friendly commerce and trade not only with Powhatan but also with his subjects round about us.\"[44] The marriage was controversial in the British court at the time because \"a commoner\" had \"the audacity\" to marry a \"princess\".[45][46]\\n One goal of the London Company was to convert Native Americans to Christianity, and they saw an opportunity to promote further investment with the conversion of Pocahontas and her marriage to Rolfe, all of which also helped end the First Anglo-Powhatan War. The company decided to bring Pocahontas to England as a symbol of the tamed New World \"savage\" and the success of the Virginia colony,[47] and the Rolfes arrived at the port of Plymouth on June 12, 1616.[48] The family journeyed to London by coach, accompanied by eleven other Powhatans including a holy man named Tomocomo.[49] John Smith was living in London at the time while Pocahontas was in Plymouth, and she learned that he was still alive.[50] Smith did not meet Pocahontas, but he wrote to Queen Anne urging that Pocahontas be treated with respect as a royal visitor. He suggested that, if she were treated badly, her \"present love to us and Christianity might turn to... scorn and fury\", and England might lose the chance to \"rightly have a Kingdom by her means\".[7]\\n Pocahontas was entertained at various social gatherings. On January 5, 1617, she and Tomocomo were brought before King James at the old Banqueting House in the Palace of Whitehall at a performance of Ben Jonson\\'s masque The Vision of Delight. According to Smith, the king was so unprepossessing that neither Pocahontas nor Tomocomo realized whom they had met until it was explained to them afterward.[50]\\n Pocahontas was not a princess in Powhatan culture, but the London Company presented her as one to the English public because she was the daughter of an important chief. The inscription on a 1616 engraving of Pocahontas reads \"MATOAKA ALS REBECCA FILIA POTENTISS\\xa0: PRINC\\xa0: POWHATANI IMP:VIRGINIÆ\", meaning \"Matoaka, alias Rebecca, daughter of the most powerful prince of the Powhatan Empire of Virginia\". Many English at this time recognized Powhatan as the ruler of an empire, and presumably accorded to his daughter what they considered appropriate status. Smith\\'s letter to Queen Anne refers to \"Powhatan their chief King\".[7] Cleric and travel writer Samuel Purchas recalled meeting Pocahontas in London, noting that she impressed those whom she met because she \"carried her selfe as the daughter of a king\".[51] When he met her again in London, Smith referred to her deferentially as a \"King\\'s daughter\".[52]\\n Pocahontas was apparently treated well in London. At the masque, her seats were described as \"well placed\"[53] and, according to Purchas, London\\'s Bishop John King \"entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond what I have seen in his greate hospitalitie afforded to other ladies\".[54]\\n Not all the English were so impressed, however. Helen C. Rountree claims that there is no contemporaneous evidence to suggest that Pocahontas was regarded in England \"as anything like royalty,\" despite the writings of John Smith. Rather, she was considered to be something of a curiosity, according to Rountree, who suggests that she was merely \"the Virginian woman\" to most Englishmen.[19]\\n Pocahontas and Rolfe lived in the suburb of Brentford, Middlesex, for some time, as well as at Rolfe\\'s family home at Heacham, Norfolk. In early 1617, Smith met the couple at a social gathering and wrote that, when Pocahontas saw him, \"without any words, she turned about, obscured her face, as not seeming well contented,\" and was left alone for two or three hours. Later, they spoke more; Smith\\'s record of what she said to him is fragmentary and enigmatic. She reminded him of the \"courtesies she had done,\" saying, \"you did promise Powhatan what was yours would be his, and he the like to you.\" She then discomfited him by calling him \"father,\" explaining that Smith had called Powhatan \"father\" when he was a stranger in Virginia, \"and by the same reason so must I do you\". Smith did not accept this form of address because, he wrote, Pocahontas outranked him as \"a King\\'s daughter\". Pocahontas then said, \"with a well-set countenance\":\\n Were you not afraid to come into my father\\'s country and caused fear in him and all his people (but me) and fear you here I should call you \"father\"? I tell you then I will, and you shall call me child, and so I will be for ever and ever your countryman.[50] Finally, Pocahontas told Smith that she and her tribe had thought him dead, but her father had told Tomocomo to seek him \"because your countrymen will lie much\".[50]\\n In March 1617, Rolfe and Pocahontas boarded a ship to return to Virginia, but they had sailed only as far as Gravesend on the River Thames when Pocahontas became gravely ill.[55] She was taken ashore, where she died from unknown causes, aged approximately 21 and \"much lamented\". According to Rolfe, she declared that \"all must die\"; for her, it was enough that her child lived.[56] Speculated causes of her death include pneumonia, smallpox, tuberculosis, hemorrhagic dysentery (\"the Bloody flux\") and poisoning.[57][58]\\n Pocahontas\\'s funeral took place on March 21, 1617, in the parish of St George\\'s Church, Gravesend.[59] Her grave is thought to be underneath the church\\'s chancel, though that church was destroyed in a fire in 1727 and its exact site is unknown.[60] Since 1958 she has been commemorated by a life-sized bronze statue in St. George\\'s churchyard, a replica of the 1907 Jamestown sculpture by the American sculptor William Ordway Partridge.[61]\\n Pocahontas and John Rolfe had a son, Thomas Rolfe, born in January 1615.[62] Thomas and his wife, Jane Poythress, had a daughter, Jane Rolfe,[63] who was born in Varina, in present-day Henrico County, Virginia, on October 10, 1650.[64] Jane married Robert Bolling of present-day Prince George County, Virginia. Their son, John Bolling, was born in 1676.[64] John Bolling married Mary Kennon[64] and had six surviving children, each of whom married and had surviving children.[65]\\n In 1907, Pocahontas was the first Native American to be honored on a U.S. stamp.[66] She was a member of the inaugural class of Virginia Women in History in 2000.[67] In July 2015, the Pamunkey Native tribe became the first federally recognized tribe in the state of Virginia; they are descendants of the Powhatan chiefdom, of which Pocahontas was a member.[68] Pocahontas is the twelfth great-grandmother of the American actor Edward Norton.[69]\\n After her death, increasingly fanciful and romanticized representations were produced about Pocahontas, in which she and Smith are frequently portrayed as romantically involved. Contemporaneous sources substantiate claims of their friendship but not romance.[43] The first claim of their romantic involvement was in John Davis\\' Travels in the United States of America (1803).[71]\\n Rayna Green has discussed the similar fetishization that Native and Asian women experience. Both groups are viewed as \"exotic\" and \"submissive,\" which aids their dehumanization.[72] Also, Green touches on how Native women had to either \"keep their exotic distance or die,\" which is associated with the widespread image of Pocahontas trying to sacrifice her life for John Smith.[72]\\n Cornel Pewewardy writes, \"In Pocahontas, Indian characters such as Grandmother Willow, Meeko, and Flit belong to the Disney tradition of familiar animals. In so doing, they are rendered as cartoons, certainly less realistic than Pocahontas and John Smith; In this way, Indians remain marginal and invisible, thereby ironically being \\'strangers in their own lands\\' – the shadow Indians. They fight desperately on the silver screen in defense of their asserted rights, but die trying to kill the white hero or save the Indian woman.’\"[73]\\n Films about Pocahontas include:', 'The Jungle Book is an 1894 collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling. Most of the characters are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear, though a principal character is the boy or \"man-cub\" Mowgli, who is raised in the jungle by wolves. Most stories are set in a forest in India; one place mentioned repeatedly is \"Seeonee\" (Seoni), in the central\\nstate of Madhya Pradesh.\\n A major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering, as in the life of Mowgli, echoing Kipling\\'s own childhood. The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies, as well as Mowgli\\'s. Another important theme is of law and freedom; the stories are not about animal behaviour, still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival, but about human archetypes in animal form. They teach respect for authority, obedience, and knowing one\\'s place in society with \"the law of the jungle\", but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds, such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village. Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories, reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature.\\n The Jungle Book has remained popular, partly through its many adaptations for film and other media. Critics such as Swati Singh have noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his supposed imperialism have admired the power of his storytelling.[1] The book has been influential in the scout movement, whose founder, Robert Baden-Powell, was a friend of Kipling.[2] Percy Grainger composed his Jungle Book Cycle around quotations from the book.\\n Rudyard Kipling\\'s stories were first printed in magazines in 1893 and 1894; the original publications also contained hand-sketched illustrations, with some from John Lockwood Kipling, his father. Rudyard himself was born in Mumbai—then referred to as Bombay—in the western coastal Indian state of Maharashtra, where he spent his first six years of life. After around 10 years back in England, and having completed his schooling, Kipling went back to India to work for nearly 6½ years. Later on, his original stories would be written when he lived at Naulakha, the property and home he owned in Dummerston, Vermont, US.[3] There is evidence that Kipling wrote the collection of stories for his daughter, Josephine (who died from pneumonia in 1899, aged 6); a first-edition copy of the book—including a handwritten note by the author to his young daughter—was discovered at the National Trust\\'s Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire, in 2010.[4]\\n The tales in the book (as well as those in The Second Jungle Book, which followed in 1895 and includes eight further stories, including five about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to teach moral lessons. The verses of \"The Law of the Jungle\", for example, lay down rules for the safety of individuals, families, and communities. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or \"heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle\".[5] Other readers have interpreted the work as allegories of the politics and society of the time.[6]\\n The stories in The Jungle Book were inspired in part by the ancient Indian fable texts such as the Panchatantra and the Jataka tales.[7] For example, an older moral-filled mongoose and snake version of the \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\" story by Kipling is found in Book 5 of Panchatantra.[8] In a letter to the American author Edward Everett Hale, Kipling wrote:[7]\\n The idea of beast-tales seems to me new in that it is a most ancient and long forgotten idea. The really fascinating tales are those that the Bodhisat tells of his previous incarnations ending always with the beautiful moral. Most of the native hunters in India today think pretty much along the lines of an animal\\'s brain and I have \"cribbed\" freely from their tales.\\n In a letter written and signed by Kipling in or around 1895, states Alison Flood in The Guardian, Kipling confesses to borrowing ideas and stories in the Jungle Book: \"I am afraid that all that code in its outlines has been manufactured to meet \\'the necessities of the case\\': though a little of it is bodily taken from (Southern) Esquimaux rules for the division of spoils. In fact, it is extremely possible that I have helped myself promiscuously but at present cannot remember from whose stories I have stolen\".[10]\\n Shere Khan, the main antagonist of the story, is named after the historical Afghan Emperor Sher Shah Suri.[11]\\n Kipling lived in India as a child, and most of the stories[a] are evidently set there, though it is not entirely clear where. The Kipling Society notes that \"Seeonee\" (Seoni, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh) is mentioned several times; that the \"cold lairs\" must be in the jungled hills of Chittorgarh; and that the first Mowgli story, \"In the Rukh\", is set in a forest reserve somewhere in North India, south of Simla. \"Mowgli\\'s Brothers\" was positioned in the Aravalli hills of Rajasthan (northwestern India) in an early manuscript, later changed to Seonee, and Bagheera treks from \"Oodeypore\" (Udaipur), a journey of reasonable length to Aravalli but a long way from Seoni.[12][13] Seoni has a tropical savanna climate, with a dry and a rainy season. This is drier than a monsoon climate and does not support tropical rainforest.[14] Forested parks and reserves that claim to be associated with the stories include Kanha Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh,[15] and Pench National Park, near Seoni,[16] but Kipling never visited the area.[12]\\n The book is arranged with a story in each chapter. Each story is followed by a poem that serves as an epigram.\\n Many of the characters (marked *) are named simply after the Hindustani names of their species: for example, Baloo is a transliteration of Hindustani भालू/بھالو Bhālū, \"bear\". The characters (marked ^) from \"The White Seal\" are transliterations from the Russian of the Pribilof Islands.\\n The early editions were illustrated with drawings in the text by John Lockwood Kipling (Rudyard\\'s father), and the American artists W. H. Drake and Paul Frenzeny.[20]\\n The book has appeared in over 500 print editions,[21] and over 100 audiobooks.[22] It has been translated into at least 36 languages.[23] In 2024, page proofs of the book were donated to Cambridge University Library.[24]\\n Critics such as Harry Ricketts have observed that Kipling returns repeatedly to the theme of the abandoned and fostered child, recalling his own childhood feelings of abandonment. In his view, the enemy, Shere Khan, represents the \"malevolent would-be foster-parent\" who Mowgli in the end outwits and destroys, just as Kipling as a boy had to face Mrs Holloway in place of his parents. Ricketts writes that in \"Mowgli\\'s Brothers\", the hero loses his human parents at the outset, and his wolf fosterers at the conclusion; and Mowgli is again rejected at the end of \"Tiger! Tiger!\", but each time is compensated by \"a queue of would-be foster-parents\" including the wolves, Baloo, Bagheera and Kaa. In Ricketts\\'s view, the power that Mowgli has over all these characters who compete for his affection is part of the book\\'s appeal to children.[25] The historian of India Philip Mason similarly emphasises the Mowgli myth, where the fostered hero, \"the odd man out among wolves and men alike\", eventually triumphs over his enemies. Mason notes that both Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal do much the same.[26]\\n The novelist Marghanita Laski argued that the purpose of the stories was not to teach about animals but to create human archetypes through the animal characters, with lessons of respect for authority. She noted that Kipling was a friend of the founder of the Scout Movement, Robert Baden-Powell, who based the junior scout \"Wolf Cubs\" on the stories, and that Kipling admired the movement.[25][27] Ricketts wrote that Kipling was obsessed by rules, a theme running throughout the stories and named explicitly as \"the law of the jungle\". Part of this, Ricketts supposed, was Mrs Holloway\\'s evangelicalism, suitably transformed. The rules required obedience and \"knowing your place\", but also provided social relationships and \"freedom to move between different worlds\".[25] Sandra Kemp observed that the law may be highly codified, but that the energies are also lawless, embodying the part of human nature which is \"floating, irresponsible and self-absorbed\".[25][28] There is a duality between the two worlds of the village and the jungle, but Mowgli, like Mang the bat, can travel between the two.[25]\\n The novelist and critic Angus Wilson noted that Kipling\\'s law of the jungle was \"far from Darwinian\", since no attacks were allowed at the water-hole when in drought.[h] In Wilson\\'s view, the popularity of the Mowgli stories is thus not literary but moral: the animals can follow the law easily, but Mowgli has human joys and sorrows, and the burden of making decisions.[25][29] Kipling\\'s biographer, Charles Carrington, argued that the \"fables\" about Mowgli illustrate truths directly, as successful fables do, through the character of Mowgli himself; through his \"kindly mentors\", Bagheera and Baloo; through the repeated failure of the \"bully\" Shere Khan; through the endless but useless talk of the Bandar-log; and through the law, which makes the jungle \"an integrated whole\" while enabling Mowgli\\'s brothers to live as the \"Free People\".[30]\\n The academic Jan Montefiore commented on the book\\'s balance of law and freedom that \"you don\\'t need to invoke Jacqueline Rose on the adult\\'s dream of the child\\'s innocence or Perry Nodelman\\'s theory of children\\'s literature colonising its readers\\' minds with a double fantasy of the child as both noble savage and embryo good citizen, to see that the Jungle Books .. give their readers a vicarious experience of adventure both as freedom and as service to a just State\".[31]\\n Sayan Mukherjee, writing for the Book Review Circle, calls The Jungle Book \"one of the most enjoyable books of my childhood and even in adulthood, highly informative as to the outlook of the British on their \\'native population\\'\".[32]\\n The academic Jopi Nyman argued in 2001 that the book formed part of the construction of \"colonial English national identity\"[33] within Kipling\\'s \"imperial project\".[33] In Nyman\\'s view, nation, race and class are mapped out in the stories, contributing to \"an imagining of Englishness\" as a site of power and racial superiority.[33] Nyman suggested that The Jungle Book\\'s monkeys and snakes represent \"colonial animals\"[33] and \"racialized Others\"[33] within the Indian jungle, whereas the White Seal promotes \"\\'truly English\\' identities in the nationalist allegory\"[33] of that story.[33]\\n Swati Singh, in his Secret History of the Jungle Book, notes that the tone is like that of Indian folklore, fable-like, and that critics have speculated that the Kipling may have heard similar stories from his Hindu bearer and his Portuguese ayah (nanny) during his childhood in India. Singh observes, too, that Kipling wove \"magic and fantasy\" into the stories for his daughter Josephine, and that even critics reading Kipling for signs of imperialism could not help admiring the power of his storytelling.[1]\\n The Jungle Book came to be used as a motivational book by the Cub Scouts, a junior element of the Scouting movement. This use of the book\\'s universe was approved by Kipling at the request of Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouting movement, who had originally asked for the author\\'s permission for the use of the Memory Game from Kim in his scheme to develop the morale and fitness of working-class youths in cities. Akela, the head wolf in The Jungle Book, has become a senior figure in the movement; the name is traditionally adopted by the leader of each Cub Scout pack.[2]\\n The Jungle Book has been adapted many times in a wide variety of media. In literature, Robert Heinlein wrote the Hugo Award-winning science fiction novel, Stranger in a Strange Land (1961), when his wife, Virginia, suggested a new version of The Jungle Book, but with a child raised by Martians instead of wolves.[34][35] Neil Gaiman\\'s The Graveyard Book (2008) is inspired by The Jungle Book. It follows a baby boy who is found and brought up by the dead in a cemetery. It has many scenes that can be traced to Kipling, but with Gaiman\\'s dark twist.[36]\\n In music, the Jungle Book cycle (1958) was written by the Australian composer Percy Grainger, an avid Kipling reader. It consists of quotations from the book, set as choral pieces and solos for soprano, tenor or baritone.[37] The French composer Charles Koechlin wrote several symphonic works inspired by the book.\\n BBC Radio broadcast an adaptation on 14 February 1994 and released it as a BBC audiobook in 2008.[38] It was directed by Chris Wallis with Nisha K. Nayar as Mowgli, Eartha Kitt as Kaa, Freddie Jones as Baloo, and Jonathan Hyde as Bagheera. The music was by John Mayer.[39]\\n The book\\'s text has been adapted for younger readers with comic book adaptations such as DC Comics Elseworlds\\' story, \"Superman: The Feral Man of Steel\", in which an infant Superman is raised by wolves, while Bagheera, Akela, and Shere Khan make appearances.[40] Marvel Comics published several adaptations by Mary Jo Duffy and Gil Kane in the pages of Marvel Fanfare (vol. 1). These were collected in the one-shot Marvel Illustrated: The Jungle Book (2007).[41] Bill Willingham\\'s comic book series, Fables, features The Jungle Book\\'s Mowgli, Bagheera, and Shere Khan.[42]\\n Manga Classics: The Jungle Book was\\xa0published by UDON Entertainment\\'s Manga Classics imprint in June 2017.[43]\\n Many films have been based on one or another of Kipling\\'s stories, including Elephant Boy (1937),[44] Chuck Jones\\'s made for-TV cartoons Rikki-Tikki-Tavi (1975),[45] The White Seal (1975),[46] and Mowgli\\'s Brothers (1976).[47] Many films, too, have been made of the book as a whole, such as Zoltán Korda\\'s 1942 film,[48] Disney\\'s 1967 animated film[49] and its 2016 remake.[50] Other adaptations include the Russian adaptation named Mowgli, published as Adventures of Mowgli in the US, an animation released between 1967 and 1971, and combined into a single 96-minute feature film in 1973,[51] and the 1989 Italian-Japanese anime The Jungle Book: Adventures of Mogwli.[52]\\n Stuart Paterson wrote a stage adaptation in 2004, first produced by the Birmingham Old Rep in 2004 and published in 2007 by Nick Hern Books.[53]\\n In 2021 BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation by Ayeesha Menon which resets the story as a \"gangland coming-of-age fable\" in modern India.[54]', 'Bambi is a 1942 American animated drama film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. Loosely based on Felix Salten\\'s 1923 novel Bambi, a Life in the Woods, the production was supervised by David D. Hand, and was directed by a team of sequence directors, including James Algar, Bill Roberts, Norman Wright, Sam Armstrong, Paul Satterfield, and Graham Heid.\\n The main characters are Bambi, a white-tailed deer; his parents (the Great Prince of the forest and his unnamed mother); his friends Thumper (a pink-nosed rabbit); and Flower (a skunk); and his childhood friend and future mate, Faline. In the original book, Bambi was a roe deer, a species native to Europe; but Disney decided to base the character on a mule deer from Arrowhead, California.[4][5][6] Illustrator Maurice \"Jake\" Day convinced Disney that the mule deer had large \"mule-like\" ears and were more common to western North America; but that the white-tail deer was more recognized throughout the United States.[7]\\n The film received three Academy Award nominations: Best Sound (Sam Slyfield), Best Song (for \"Love Is a Song\" sung by Donald Novis) and Original Music Score.[8]\\n In June 2008, the American Film Institute presented a list of its \"10 Top 10\"—the best ten films in each of ten classic American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. Bambi placed third in animation.[9] In December 2011, the film was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\".[10][11][12]\\n In January 2020, it was announced that a photorealistic computer-animated remake was in development.[13]\\n In a Maine forest, a doe gives birth to a male fawn named Bambi, who will one day take over the position of Great Prince of the Forest, who guards the woodland creatures and (unbeknownst to Bambi himself) is his father. Bambi grows up very attached to his mother, with whom he spends most of his time.  The fawn is befriended by an eager, energetic male rabbit named Thumper, who helps to teach him to walk and speak, a young male skunk he mistakenly calls \"Flower\" (who is so flattered, he keeps the name) and a female fawn named Faline. Curious and inquisitive, Bambi frequently asks about the world around him and is cautioned about the dangers of life as a forest creature by his loving mother. One day out in a meadow, Bambi briefly sees the Great Prince but does not know that he is his father. As the Great Prince wanders uphill, he discovers the human hunter, named \"Man\" by all the animals, is coming and rushes down to the meadow to get everyone to safety. Bambi is briefly separated from his mother during that time but is escorted to her by the Great Prince as the three of them make it back in the forest just as Man fires his gun.\\n During Bambi\\'s first winter, he and Thumper play in the snow while Flower hibernates. One day his mother takes him to find food when Man shows up again. As they run off, his mother is shot and killed by the hunter, leaving the little fawn mournful and alone. Taking pity on his abandoned son, the Great Prince leads Bambi home as he reveals to him that he is his father. Next year, Bambi has matured into a young stag, and his childhood friends have also entered young adulthood. They are warned about becoming \"twitterpated\" by Friend Owl and that they will eventually fall in love, but the trio views the concept of romance with scorn. Thumper and Flower soon encounter their beautiful romantic counterparts and abandon their former thoughts on love. Bambi himself encounters Faline as a beautiful doe. Their courtship is quickly interrupted by a belligerent older stag named Ronno, who attempts to force Faline away from Bambi. Bambi successfully manages to defeat Ronno in battle and earn the rights to the doe\\'s affections.\\n Bambi is awakened afterward by the smell of smoke; he follows it and discovers it leads to a hunter camp. His father warns Bambi that Man has returned with more hunters. Bambi is separated from Faline in the turmoil, but finds her cornered by Man\\'s vicious hunting dogs, which he manages to ward off. Bambi escapes them and is shot by Man, but survives. Meanwhile, at the \"Man\\'s\" camp, their campfire suddenly spreads into the forest, resulting in a wildfire from which the forest residents flee in fear. Bambi, his father, Faline, and the forest animals manage to reach shelter on a riverbank. The following spring, Faline gives birth to twins under Bambi\\'s watchful eye as the new Great Prince of the Forest.\\n The voice cast was all uncredited, as was the practice at the time for many animated films.\\n In 1933, Sidney Franklin purchased the rights to Felix Salten\\'s novel Bambi, a Life in the Woods (1923) to produce a live-action film for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but soon realized that it would be too difficult to achieve.[14][22] Joseph M. Schenck of United Artists suggested he make an animated version in alliance with Walt Disney, who was contemplating the idea of his first full-length feature at the time, with Bambi as one of the possible choices.[23] Later that year, Franklin approached him with the idea, but Disney eventually refused, feeling that his animation studio was unprepared for the technical difficulties that Bambi would have presented.[23][24] Franklin sold the film rights to Walt Disney in April 1937.[25] Disney began work on crafting an animated adaptation immediately, intending it to be the company\\'s second feature-length animated film and their first to be based on a specific, recent work.[25] However, the original novel was written for an adult audience, and was considered too \"grim\" and \"somber\" for a regular light-hearted Disney film.[25] The artists also discovered that it would be challenging to animate deer realistically.[26] These difficulties resulted in Disney putting production on hold while the studio worked on several other projects, and eventually Pinocchio became the studio\\'s second film.[25] In 1938, Disney assigned Perce Pearce and Carl Fallberg to work on the film\\'s storyboards, but attention was soon drawn away as the studio began working on Fantasia.[25] Finally, on August 17, 1939, production on Bambi began in earnest, but progressed slowly owing to changes in the studio personnel, location, and methodology of handling animation at the time.[25]\\n \\nThere were many interpretations of the story. As writer and animator Mel Shaw recalled:  The story of Bambi had a so many possibilities, you could go off on a million tangents. I remember one situation when Walt became involved with himself. He said \\'Suppose we have Bambi step on an ant hill and we cut inside and see all the damage he\\'s done to the ant civilization\\'. We spent weeks and weeks developing the ants, and then all of a sudden we decided, you know, we\\'re way off the story, this has got nothing to do with the story of Bambi. We also had a family of grasshoppers, and they get into a family squabble of this or that, and Bambi is watching all of this, and here\\'s the big head of Bambi in the grasshoppers. And what\\'s that got to do with the story, and this would go on many times.[26] Originally the film was intended to have six individual bunny characters, similar to the dwarfs in Snow White. However Perce Pearce suggested that they could instead have five generic rabbits and one rabbit with a different color than the rest, with one tooth, would have a very distinct personality.[27] This character later became known as Thumper.\\n There originally was a brief shot in the scene where Bambi\\'s mother dies after jumping over a log and getting shot by a man. Larry Morey, however, felt the scene was too dramatic, and that it was emotional enough to justify having her death occur off screen.[26][27] Walt Disney was also eager to show the man burned to death by his fire that he inadvertently started, but this was discarded when it was decided not to show the man at all.[26] There was also a scene involving two autumn leaves conversing like an old married couple before parting ways and falling to the ground, but Disney found that talking flora did not work in the context of the film, and instead a visual metaphor of two realistic leaves falling to the ground was used instead.[27] Disney and his story team also developed the characters consisting of a squirrel and a chipmunk that were to be a comic duo reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy. However, after years of experimentation, Walt felt that the story should focus on the three principal characters: Bambi, Thumper and Flower.[27] The squirrel and chipmunk make only brief appearances in the final film.\\n The writing was completed in July 1940, by which time the film\\'s budget had increased to $858,000.[25]\\n Although the animators had animated deer in Snow White, they were animated, in the words of Eric Larson, \"like big flour sacks\".[26] Disney wanted the animals in Bambi to be more realistic and expressive than those in Snow White. He had Rico LeBrun, a painter of animals, come and lecture to the animators on the structure and movement of animals.[28] The animators visited the Los Angeles Zoo and Disney set up a small zoo at the studio with animals such as rabbits, ducks, owls, and skunks, and a pair of fawns named Bambi and Faline so that the artists could see first-hand the movement of these animals.[27][28][29] LeBrun\\'s sketches depicted realistic animals, but as characters they lacked personality. Marc Davis created the final design of Bambi by incorporating LeBrun\\'s realistic study of deer anatomy but exaggerating the character\\'s face by making his proportions baby-like (short snout, big eyes, etc.).[26] Although there were no humans in Bambi, live-action footage of humans was used for one scene: actress Jane Randolph and Ice Capades star Donna Atwood acted as live-action references for the scene where Bambi and Thumper are on the icy pond.[30] The animators learned a lot about animals during the film\\'s production, giving them a broader spectrum of animation styles to use in future projects.[31]\\n The backgrounds for the film were inspired by the Eastern American woodlands. One of the earliest and best-known artists for the Disney studio, Maurice \"Jake\" Day, spent several weeks in the Vermont and Maine forests, sketching and photographing deer, fawns, and the surrounding wilderness areas.[32] However his first sketches were too \"busy\" as the eye did not know where to focus.[26] Tyrus Wong, a Chinese animator, showed Day some of his impressionistic paintings of a forest. Day liked the paintings and appointed him art director of the film.[26] Wong\\'s backgrounds were revolutionary since they had more detail around the center and less around the edges, thus leading a viewer\\'s eye to the characters.[27]\\n Due to World War II, which began in Europe in 1939, Pinocchio and Fantasia failed at the box office. Facing financial difficulty, Disney was forced to cut 12 minutes from the film before final animation to save production costs.[25]\\n All lyrics are written by Larry Morey; all music is composed by Frank Churchill Bambi premiered in London on August 8, 1942, as the first Disney film to premiere abroad.[33][34] It was released in theaters in United States five days later, on August 13.[35] The film was released during World War II and did not perform as well as hoped.[36] Roy O. Disney sent a telegram to his brother Walt after the New York opening of the film that read: \"Fell short of our holdover figure by $4,000. Just came from Music Hall. Unable to make any deal to stay third week ... Night business is our problem.\"[37] The film earned RKO theatrical rentals of $1,270,000 in the United States and Canada in its initial release.[38][39]\\n Disney lacked access to much of the European market during the war,[37] however, the film earned rentals of $1,685,000 internationally for an initial worldwide total of $2,955,000, Disney\\'s third highest, behind Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) with $7.8 million and Pinocchio (1940) with $3.2 million.[38]\\n The film was re-released to theatres in the United States in 1947, 1957, 1966, 1975, 1982 and 1988. In its first reissue in the United States in 1947, the film earned additional domestic rentals of $900,000 but did much better 10 years later, more than doubling the domestic rental total with a further $2.5 million[40] taking its total domestic rental earnings to $4.7 million.\\n The film earned $14 million in domestic rentals from its reissues in 1966 and 1975 giving it a total domestic rental of $18,735,000,[41] which equates to a gross of around $40 million.[3] In 1982, it grossed another $23 million in the United States and Canada and in 1988, a further $39 million, taking its total in the United States and Canada to $102 million,[3] making it (at the time) the second highest-grossing animated movie of all-time after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.[42] With grosses from international reissues, the film has a worldwide gross of $267 million.[3]\\n Prior to Bambi\\'s initial release on home video on September 28, 1989, initial orders placed in the United States and Canada up to the end of August totaled 9.8 million units, the second largest number of orders for a video at the time, behind E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, with a wholesale value of $167 million.[43] Even in home video, it has seen multiple releases, including three VHS releases — in 1989 (Classics Version), 1997 (Masterpiece Collection Version), and 2005 (Platinum Edition version), one Betamax release in 1989 (Classics version), two Laserdisc releases in 1989 (Classics version) and 1997 (Masterpiece Collection version).  In 2005, a digitally remastered and restored Platinum Edition DVD was released;[44] it went on moratorium on January 31, 2007.[45]\\n Bambi was released as a Diamond Edition on March 1, 2011,[46] consisting of a Blu-ray and DVD combo pack. This release included multiple bonus features not previously included in Bambi home releases: a documentary entitled Inside Walt\\'s Story Meetings\\xa0– Enhanced Edition, two deleted scenes, a deleted song, an image gallery, and a game entitled Disney\\'s Big Book of Knowledge: Bambi Edition.[47] This release also marked the first use of \"Disney Second Screen\",[48] a feature which is accessed via a computer or iPad app download that syncs with the Blu-ray disc,[49] allowing the viewer to follow along by interacting with animated flip-books, galleries and trivia while watching the movie.[46] A UK version of Diamond Edition was released on February 7, 2011.[50]\\n In honor of the film\\'s 75th anniversary, Bambi was released as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection on May 23, 2017 (digital) and June 6, 2017 (Blu-ray/DVD/digital combo pack).\\n On August 18, 2023, Bambi was re-released in cinemas across the UK only for one week as part of Disney\\'s 100th anniversary.[51]\\n On the initiative of Stephen Greymoming, professor of Native American studies and anthropology at the University of Montana,[52] an Arapaho-language dubbing of the movie was produced in 1994, in collaboration with the Northern Plains Educational Foundation.[53] The final product was, however, only a partial dubbing, as the spoken parts were dubbed in Arapaho, but all the songs were left in English.[54][55] The dubbed version of the movie premiered on November 3 the same year, and Disney later provided the Arapaho Nation with 2000 VHS tapes of the movie.[56] The dubbing was never issued again in any other forms, until it was uploaded on the streaming platform Disney+ in October 2022.[57] Bambi was the first of three Disney movies to receive a dubbing in a Native American language.[57] The next such instance had to wait until 2016, when Pixar\\'s Finding Nemo received a dubbing in Navajo,[58] and then Disney\\'s Moana in Hawaiian two years later.[59] While the first was also made available on Disney+,[57] the latter was only distributed for free in schools in Hawaii, and never received any home media release form.[60]\\n At the time of the film\\'s release, Bambi received mixed reviews from the critics, mainly because of the lack of fantasy elements in the film and objection towards a dramatic story of animals and their struggle to survive in the woods and avoid the threat of humans.[61] The New York Times claimed that \"In the search for perfection, Mr. Disney has come perilously close to tossing away his whole world of cartoon fantasy.\"[62] Manny Farber of The New Republic wrote that \"Bambi is interesting because it\\'s the first one that\\'s been entirely unpleasant…Mickey wouldn\\'t be caught dead in this.\"\\n Farber added that \"In an attempt to ape the trumped-up realism of flesh and blood movies, he has given up fantasy, which was pretty much the magic element.\"[63] Even Disney\\'s daughter Diane complained, saying that Bambi\\'s mother did not need to die. When Walt claimed that he was only following the book, Diane protested, saying that he had taken other liberties before and that Walt Disney could do whatever he wanted.[61]\\n Today, however, Bambi is viewed much more favorably. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 53 reviews with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website consensus reads: \"Elegantly animated and deeply touching, Bambi is an enduring, endearing, and moving Disney classic.\"[64] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 91 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[65] Critics Mick Martin and Marsha Porter call the film \"the crowning achievement of Walt Disney\\'s animation studio\".[66] English film historian Leslie Halliwell wrote that Bambi was \"one of Disney\\'s most memorable and brilliant achievements with a great comic character in Thumper and a climactic forest fire sequence that is genuinely thrilling.\" He concluded that it was  \"a triumph of the animator\\'s arts\".[67]\\n In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"10 Top 10\"\\xa0– the best ten films in ten classic American film genres\\xa0– after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. Bambi was acknowledged as the third best film in the animation genre.[76] It is also listed in the Top 25 Horror Movies of All Time by Time magazine. Bambi, Time states, \"has a primal shock that still haunts oldsters who saw it 40, 50, 65 years ago.\"[77]\\n American Film Institute\\n The off-screen villain \"Man\" has been placed No. 20 on AFI\\'s List of Heroes and Villains.[78]\\n Some critics have cited parallels between Frank Churchill\\'s theme music for \"Man\" (which consisted of three simple notes) and John Williams\\'s theme music in Jaws (which consists of two notes).[79]\\n Paul McCartney has credited the shooting death of Bambi\\'s mother for his initial interest in animal rights.[80]\\n Soon after the film\\'s release, Walt Disney allowed his characters to appear in fire prevention public service campaigns. However, Bambi was only loaned to the government for a year, so a new symbol was needed, leading to the creation of Smokey Bear.[81] Bambi and his mother also make a cameo appearance in the satirical 1955 Donald Duck short No Hunting: drinking from a forest stream, the deer are startled by a sudden trickle of beer cans and other debris, and Bambi\\'s mother tells him, \"Man is in the forest. Let\\'s dig out.\"\\n In 2006, the Ad Council, in partnership with the United States Forest Service, started a series of Public Service Announcements that feature footage from Bambi and Bambi II for wildfire prevention. During the ads, as the Bambi footage is shown, the screen will momentarily fade into black with the text \"Don\\'t let our forests...become once upon a time\", and usually (but not always) ending the ads with Bambi\\'s line \"Mother, what we gonna do today?\" followed by Smokey Bear saying \"Only you can prevent wildfires\" as the Smokey logo is shown on the screen.[citation needed] Bambi had previously been the Forest Service\\'s advertising icon beginning in 1942, but was only allowed by Disney to use the character for a year.[81][82]\\n In December 2011, Bambi was among the films selected for preservation in the Library of Congress\\' National Film Registry.[83] In its induction, the Registry said that the film was one of Walt Disney\\'s favorites and that it has been \"recognized for its eloquent message of nature conservation.\"[84]\\n Characters of the film appear in several other Disney media, such as guest appearances in the animated television series House of Mouse, Bambi being a character to summon in the video game Kingdom Hearts and its sequel Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories,[85] and Bambi, Thumper, Flower, Faline and Great Prince of the Forest being playable characters in Disney Magic Kingdoms.[86][87]\\n On December 17, 2018, a prison sentence passed against a man, in what is considered the biggest deer poaching case in Missouri history, contained the stipulation that the prisoner must view the film at least once each month during his one-year prison sentence.[88]\\n The Silly Symphony Sunday comic strip ran a three-month-long adaptation of Bambi from July 19 to October 4, 1942.[89]\\n Set in the middle of Bambi, Bambi II shows the Great Prince of the Forest struggling to raise the motherless Bambi, and Bambi\\'s doubts about his father\\'s love. The film was released direct-to-video on February 7, 2006. While the film was a direct-to-video release in the United States and other countries, including Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan, it was a theatrical release in some countries, including Australia, Austria, Brazil, Dominican Republic, France, Mexico, the United Kingdom and some other European countries.[citation needed]\\n On January 28, 2020, it was announced that a photorealistic CGI feature-length remake is in development with a script co-written by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Lindsey Beer. Paul Weitz, Chris Weitz, and Andrew Miano will produce the film; a joint-venture production between Walt Disney Pictures, Depth of Field Studios, and Known Universe Productions.[13] Disney described the film as a \"companion piece\" to The Jungle Book (2016) and The Lion King (2019), as the three films feature wildlife that requires extensive CGI and special effects.[13] On June 13, 2023, it was revealed that Sarah Polley is in talks to direct the film, which is said to be a musical that will feature music from six-time Grammy-winning country star Kacey Musgraves. Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster wrote the most recent draft of the script.[90] As of March 2024, Polley was reportedly no longer attached as director.[91]\\n The copyrights for Bambi, a Life in the Woods were inherited by Anna Wyler, Salten\\'s daughter, who renewed them in 1954. After her death, Wyler\\'s husband sold the rights to Twin Books, a publishing company which subsequently filed a lawsuit against Disney, claiming Disney owed it money for the continued licensing for the use of the book. Disney countered by claiming that Salten had published the story in 1923 without a copyright notice, thus it immediately entered into the public domain. Disney also argued that if the claimed 1923 publication date was accurate, then the copyright renewal filed in 1954 had been registered after the deadline and was thus invalid. The courts initially upheld Disney\\'s view; however, in 1996, the Ninth Circuit Court reversed the decision on appeal in Twin Books Corp. v. Walt Disney Co., 83 F.3d 1162 (1996).[92][93]\\n The American copyright of the novel expired on January 1, 2022.[94]', 'The Lion King is a 1994 American animated musical coming-of-age drama film[3][4] produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution under the Walt Disney Pictures banner. The film was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff (in their feature directorial debuts) and produced by Don Hahn, from a screenplay written by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton. The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick, Moira Kelly, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Niketa Calame, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Rowan Atkinson, and Robert Guillaume. Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, with a score by Hans Zimmer. Inspired by African wildlife, the story is modelled primarily on William Shakespeare\\'s stage play Hamlet with some influence from the Biblical stories of Joseph and Moses, and follows a young heir apparent who is forced to flee after his uncle kills his father and usurps the throne. After growing up in exile, the rightful king returns to challenge the usurper and end his tyrannical rule over the kingdom.\\n Initially, The Lion King was supposed to be a non-musical, leaning towards a style similar to that of a documentary. George Scribner, who had made his feature directorial debut with Oliver & Company (1988), was hired to direct, with Allers joining him soon after following his work as a story artist or head of story on Oliver & Company, The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), and Aladdin (1992). Allers brought in Brenda Chapman and Chris Sanders, whom he had worked with on Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, to serve as head of story and production designer, respectively.\\n Woolverton, who had just wrapped up work as screenwriter for Beauty and the Beast, wrote the initial draft of the screenplay for this film, but following her departure from the project to write the libretto for the Broadway adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, Mecchi and Roberts were brought on board to finish and revise the script. Six months into production, Scribner left the project due to creative differences with Allers, producer Hahn, and Chapman about changing it into a musical, and Minkoff was hired to replace him in April 1992. Additionally, Beauty and the Beast directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise were hired to perform some additional rewrites to the script and story. Throughout production, Allers, Scribner, Minkoff, Hahn, Chapman, Sanders, and several other animators visited Kenya to observe wildlife and get inspiration for the characters and setting.\\n The Lion King was released on June 15, 1994, receiving critical acclaim for its music, story, themes, and animation. With an initial worldwide gross of $763\\xa0million, it finished its theatrical run as the highest-grossing film of 1994 and the second-highest-grossing film of all time, behind Jurassic Park (1993).[5] It also held the title of being the highest-grossing animated film, until it was overtaken by Finding Nemo (2003). The film remains the highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all time, as well as the best-selling film on home video, having sold over 55 million copies worldwide. It received two Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture\\xa0– Musical or Comedy. It is considered by many to be among the greatest animated films ever made.\\n The film has led to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation in 1997; two direct-to-video follow-ups—the sequel, The Lion King II: Simba\\'s Pride (1998), and the prequel/parallel, The Lion King 1½ (2004); two television series, The Lion King\\'s Timon & Pumbaa (1995–1999) and The Lion Guard (2016–2019), the latter which premiered as a television film titled The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar in 2015; and a photorealistic remake in 2019, which also became the highest-grossing animated film at the time of its release. In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[6] The Lion King is the first Disney film to have been dubbed in Zulu,[7] the only African language aside from Egyptian Arabic to have been used for a feature-length Disney dub.[8]\\n In the Pride Lands of Tanzania, a pride of lions rule over the kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi\\'s newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom\\'s shaman and advisor. Mufasa\\'s younger brother, Scar, covets the throne.\\n Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and forbids him from exploring beyond its borders. He explains to Simba the responsibilities of kingship and the \"circle of life\", which connects all living things. Scar manipulates Simba into exploring an elephant graveyard beyond the Pride Lands. There, Simba and his best friend, Nala, are chased by three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Mufasa is alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed with Simba for disobeying him and endangering himself and Nala, Mufasa forgives him. He explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Scar visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him kill Mufasa and Simba in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.\\n Scar sets a trap for Simba and Mufasa. He lures Simba into a gorge and signals the hyenas to drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede to trample him. Scar alerts Mufasa, who saves Simba and tries to escape the gorge; he begs for Scar\\'s help, but he throws Mufasa into the stampede to his death. Scar tricks Simba into believing that Mufasa\\'s death was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. He then orders the hyenas to kill Simba, who escapes. Unaware of Simba\\'s survival, Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed both Mufasa and Simba, and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands.\\n Simba collapses in a desert but is rescued by two outcasts, a meerkat and a warthog named Timon and Pumbaa. Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under their motto \"hakuna matata\" (\"no worries\" in Swahili). Years later, an adult Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who is revealed to be Nala. Simba and Nala fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become drought-stricken under Scar\\'s reign. Still feeling guilty over Mufasa\\'s death, Simba refuses and leaves angrily. He encounters Rafiki, who tells Simba that Mufasa\\'s spirit lives on in him. Simba is visited by the spirit of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his place as king. After Rafiki advises him to learn from the past instead of running from it, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.\\n Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who taunts Simba over his supposed role in Mufasa\\'s death. Scar then whispers to Simba, admitting for having killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba retaliates and forces Scar to confess the truth to the pride. A battle ensues between Simba and his allies and the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape, but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and blames his actions on the hyenas. Simba spares Scar\\'s life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever; Scar refuses and attacks Simba. Following a brief battle, Simba throws Scar off the ledge. Scar survives the fall, but the hyenas, who overheard him betraying them, attack and maul him to death.\\n With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba takes his place as king, and Nala becomes his queen. With the Pride Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala\\'s newborn cub to the assembled animals, thus continuing the circle of life.\\n The origin of the concept for The Lion King is widely disputed.[11][12][13] According to Charlie Fink (then-Walt Disney Feature Animation\\'s vice president for creative affairs), he approached Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney, and Peter Schneider with a \"Bambi in Africa\" idea with lions. Katzenberg balked at the idea at first, but nevertheless encouraged Fink and his writers to develop a mythos to explain how lions serviced other animals by eating them.[14] Another anecdote states that the idea was conceived during a conversation between Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney, and Schneider on a flight to Europe during a promotional tour.[l] During the conversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea.[16] Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death, and ideas from personal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his career in politics, saying about the film, \"It is a little bit about myself.\"[17]\\n On October 11, 1988, Thomas Disch (the author of The Brave Little Toaster) had met with Fink and Roy E. Disney to discuss the idea, and within the next month, he had written a nine-paged treatment entitled King of the Kalahari.[18][19] Throughout 1989, several Disney staff writers, including Jenny Tripp, Tim Disney, Valerie West and Miguel Tejada-Flores, had written treatments for the project. Tripp\\'s treatment, dated on March 2, 1989, introduced the name \"Simba\" for the main character, who gets separated from his pride and is adopted by Kwashi, a baboon, and Mabu, a mongoose. He is later raised in a community of baboons. Simba battles an evil jackal named Ndogo, and reunites with his pride.[20] Later that same year, Fink recruited his friend J. T. Allen, a writer, to develop new story treatments. Fink and Allen had earlier made several trips to a Los Angeles zoo to observe the animal behavior that was to be featured in the script. Allen completed his script, which was titled The Lion King, on January 19, 1990. However, Fink, Katzenberg, and Roy E. Disney felt Allen\\'s script could benefit from a more experienced screenwriter, and turned to Ronald Bass, who had recently won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Rain Man (1988). At the time, Bass was preoccupied to rewrite the script himself, but agreed to supervise the revisions. The new script, credited to both Allen and Bass, was retitled King of the Beasts and completed on May 23, 1990.[20]\\n Sometime later, Linda Woolverton, who was also writing Beauty and the Beast (1991), spent a year writing several drafts of the script, which was titled King of the Beasts and then King of the Jungle.[21] The original version of the film was vastly different from the final product. The plot centered on a battle between lions and baboons, with Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being a cheetah,[17] and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba\\'s childhood friends.[22] Simba would not only leave the kingdom but become a \"lazy, slovenly, horrible character\" due to manipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age.[23] By 1990, producer Thomas Schumacher, who had just completed The Rescuers Down Under (1990), decided to attach himself to the project \"because lions are cool\".[21] Schumacher likened the King of the Jungle script to \"an animated National Geographic special\".[24]\\n George Scribner, who had directed Oliver & Company (1988), was the initial director of the film,[25] being later joined by Roger Allers, who was the lead story man on Beauty and the Beast (1991).[11][16] Allers worked with Scribner and Woolverton on the project, but temporarily left the project to help rewrite Aladdin (1992). Eight months later, Allers returned to the project,[26][27] and brought Brenda Chapman and Chris Sanders with him.[28] In October 1991, several of the lead crew members, including Allers, Scribner, Chapman, Sanders, and Lisa Keene visited Hell\\'s Gate National Park in Kenya, in order to study and gain an appreciation of the environment for the film.[29][30] After six months of story development work, Scribner decided to leave the project upon clashing with Allers and the producers over their decision to turn the film into a musical, since Scribner\\'s intention was of making a documentary-like film more focused on natural aspects.[16][25] By April 1992, Rob Minkoff had replaced Scribner as the new co-director.[9][28]\\n Don Hahn joined the production as the film\\'s producer because Schumacher was promoted to Vice President of Development for Walt Disney Feature Animation.[24][31] Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme, and after establishing the main theme as \"leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world\", asked for a final retool. Allers, Minkoff, Chapman, and Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale, who had finished directing Beauty and the Beast (1991).[32] One of the definite ideas that stemmed from the meetings was to have Mufasa return as a ghost. Allers also changed the character Rafiki from a more serious court advisor into a wacky shaman.[33] The title was also changed from King of the Jungle to The Lion King, as the setting was not the jungle but the savannah.[16] It was also decided to make Mufasa and Scar brothers, as the writers felt it was much more interesting if the threat came from someone within the family.[34] Allers and Minkoff pitched the revised story to Katzenberg and Michael Eisner, to which Eisner felt the story \"could be more Shakespearean\"; he suggested modeling the story on King Lear. Maureen Donley, an associate producer, countered, stating that the story resembled Hamlet.[35] Continuing on the idea, Allers recalled Katzenberg asking them to \"put in as much Hamlet as you can\". However, they felt it was too forced, and looked to other heroic archetypes such as the stories of Joseph and Moses from the Bible.[36]\\n Not counting most of the segments from Fantasia (1940), Saludos Amigos (1942), The Three Caballeros (1944), Make Mine Music (1946), and Melody Time (1948); and The Rescuers Down Under (1990) (a sequel to The Rescuers (1977)), The Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story, rather than be based on pre-existing works and characters. The filmmakers have stated that the story of The Lion King was inspired by the lives of Joseph and Moses from the Bible, and Shakespeare\\'s Hamlet,[34] though the story has also drawn some comparisons to Shakespeare\\'s lesser known plays Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2.[37]\\n By this point, Woolverton had left the production to work on the Broadway adaptation of Beauty and the Beast.[9] To replace her, Allers and Minkoff met with numerous screenwriters, including Billy Bob Thornton and Joss Whedon, to discuss writing the new screenplay.[35] During the summer of 1992, Irene Mecchi was hired as the new screenwriter, and months later, she was joined by Jonathan Roberts. Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process, fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comedic situations for Pumbaa, Timon, and the hyenas.[38][9]\\n Lyricist Tim Rice worked closely with the screenwriting team, flying to California at least once a month, as his songs for the film needed to work in the narrative continuity. Rice\\'s lyrics—which were reworked up to the production\\'s end—were pinned to the storyboards during development.[39] Rewrites were frequent, with animator Andreas Deja saying that completed scenes would be delivered, only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated because of dialogue changes.[40] Due to the rewrites, The Lion King missed its initial release window for Thanksgiving 1993, with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) assuming its release slot.[41] Hahn stated the film was delayed to a summer 1994 release, \"with much consternation, because people said you can\\'t release animation in the summertime.\"[42]\\n The voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the characters; for instance, James Earl Jones was cast because the directors found his voice \"powerful\" and similar to a lion\\'s roar.[43] Jones remarked that during the years of production, Mufasa \"became more and more of a dopey dad instead of [a] grand king\".[44]\\n Nathan Lane auditioned for Zazu, and Ernie Sabella for one of the hyenas. Upon meeting at the recording studio, Lane and Sabella\\xa0– who were starring together in a Broadway production of Guys and Dolls at the time\\xa0– were asked to record together as hyenas. The directors laughed at their performance and decided to instead cast them as Timon and Pumbaa.[43][45] For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite Cheech & Chong, but while Cheech Marin agreed to voice Banzai, Tommy Chong was unavailable. His role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, voiced by Whoopi Goldberg, who insisted on being in the film.[22] The English double act Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer auditioned for roles as a pair of chipmunks; according to Mortimer, the producers were enthusiastic, but he and Reeves were uncomfortable with their corporate attitude and abandoned the film.[46] Rowan Atkinson was initially uninterested in the studio\\'s offer to voice Zazu, later explaining that \"voice work is something I generally had never done and never liked [...] I\\'m a visual artist, if I\\'m anything, and it seemed to be a pointless thing to do\". His friend and fellow Mr. Bean writer/actor Robin Driscoll convinced him to accept the role, and Atkinson retrospectively expressed that The Lion King became \"a really, very special film\".[47]\\n Matthew Broderick was cast as adult Simba early during production. Broderick only recorded with another actor once over the three years he worked on the film, and only learned that Moira Kelly voiced Nala at the film\\'s premiere.[48] English actors Tim Curry, Malcolm McDowell, Alan Rickman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen were considered for the role of Scar,[49] which eventually went to fellow Englishman Jeremy Irons.[50] Irons initially turned down the part, as he felt uncomfortable going to a comedic role after his dramatic portrayal of Claus von Bülow in Reversal of Fortune (1990). His performance in that film inspired the writers to incorporate more of his acting as von Bülow in the script\\xa0– adding one of that character\\'s lines, \"You have no idea\"\\xa0– and prompted animator Andreas Deja to watch Reversal of Fortune and Damage (1992) in order to incorporate Irons\\' facial traits and tics.[44][51]\\n \"The Lion King was considered a little movie because we were going to take some risks. The pitch for the story was a lion cub gets framed for murder by his uncle set to the music of Elton John. People said, \\'What? Good luck with that.\\' But for some reason, the people who ended up on the movie were highly passionate about it and motivated.\"\\n Don Hahn[45] The development of The Lion King coincided with that of Pocahontas (1995), which most of the animators of Walt Disney Feature Animation decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.[34] The story artists also did not have much faith in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job \"because the story wasn\\'t very good\",[52] and Burny Mattinson telling his colleague Joe Ranft: \"I don\\'t know who is going to want to watch that one.\"[53] Most of the leading animators either were doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal.[17] Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and in Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film\\'s main characters. The animation leads for the main characters included Mark Henn on young Simba, Ruben A. Aquino on adult Simba, Andreas Deja on Scar, Aaron Blaise on young Nala, Anthony DeRosa on adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa.[9] Nearly twenty minutes of the film, including the \"I Just Can\\'t Wait to Be King\" sequence,[22] was animated at the Disney-MGM Studios facility. More than 600 artists, animators, and technicians contributed to The Lion King.[25] Weeks before the film\\'s release, the 1994 Northridge earthquake shut down the studio and required the animators to complete via remote work.[54]\\n The character animators studied real-life animals for reference, as was done for Bambi (1942). Jim Fowler, renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity.[55] The animators also studied animal movements at the Miami MetroZoo under guidance from wildlife expert Ron Magill.[56] The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries—which employ telephoto lenses to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher—who, following Scribner\\'s request for realism, tried to depict effects such as lens flare—and the works of painters Charles Marion Russell, Frederic Remington, and Maxfield Parrish.[57][58] Art director Andy Gaskill and the filmmakers sought to give the film a sense of grand sweep and epic scale similar to Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Gaskill explained: \"We wanted audiences to sense the vastness of the savannah and to feel the dust and the breeze swaying through the grass. In other words, to get a real sense of nature and to feel as if they were there. It\\'s very difficult to capture something as subtle as a sunrise or rain falling on a pond, but those are the kinds of images that we tried to get.\" The filmmakers also watched the films of John Ford and other filmmakers, which also influenced the design of the film.[9]\\n Because the characters were not anthropomorphized, all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through the use of longer shots following the characters.[22]\\n Computers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways. For the wildebeest stampede sequence, several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, cel shaded to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd.[59] Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the two-and-a-half-minute stampede.[9] The Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) helped simulate camera movements such as tracking shots, and was employed in coloring, lighting, and particle effects.[22]\\n Lyricist Tim Rice, who was working with composer Alan Menken on songs for Aladdin (1992), was invited to write songs for The Lion King, and accepted on the condition of bringing in a composing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice\\'s suggestion of Elton John,[43] after Rice\\'s invitation of ABBA fell through due to Benny Andersson\\'s commitments to the stage musical Kristina från Duvemåla.[17] John expressed an interest in writing \"ultra-pop songs that kids would like; then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them\", mentioning a possible influence of The Jungle Book (1967), where he felt the \"music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults\".[60]\\n Rice and John wrote five original songs for The Lion King (\"Circle of Life\", \"I Just Can\\'t Wait to Be King\", \"Be Prepared\", \"Hakuna Matata\", and \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\"), with John\\'s performance of \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" playing over the end credits.[61] The IMAX and DVD releases added another song, \"The Morning Report\", based on a song discarded during development that eventually featured in the live musical version of The Lion King.[62] The score was composed by Hans Zimmer, who was hired based on his earlier work on two films in African settings, A World Apart (1988) and The Power of One (1992),[63] and supplemented the score with traditional native African music and choir elements arranged by Lebo M.[61] Zimmer\\'s partners Mark Mancina and Jay Rifkin helped with arrangements and song production.[64]\\n The Lion King original motion picture soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on April 27, 1994. It was the fourth-best-selling album of the year on the Billboard 200 and the top-selling soundtrack.[65] It is the only soundtrack to an animated film to be certified Diamond (10× platinum) by the Recording Industry Association of America. Zimmer\\'s complete instrumental score for the film was never originally given a full release, until the soundtrack\\'s commemorative twentieth anniversary re-release in 2014.[66] The Lion King also inspired the 1995 release Rhythm of the Pride Lands, with eight songs by Zimmer, Mancina, and Lebo M.[67]\\n The use of the song \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\" in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa led to disputes between Disney and the family of South African Solomon Linda, who composed the song (originally titled \"Mbube\") in 1939. In July 2004, Linda\\'s family filed a lawsuit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda\\'s heirs reached a settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.[68]\\n For The Lion King\\'s first film trailer, Disney opted to feature a single scene, the entire opening sequence with the song \"Circle of Life\". Buena Vista Pictures Distribution president Dick Cook said the decision was made for such an approach because \"we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece that we felt like it was probably one of the best four minutes of film that we\\'ve seen\", and Don Hahn added that \"Circle of Life\" worked as a trailer as it \"came off so strong, and so good, and ended with such a bang\". The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying The Three Musketeers (1993) and Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993) in theaters; by then, only a third of The Lion King had been completed.[42][69] Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview.[42] Prior to the film\\'s release, Disney did 11 test screenings.[70]\\n Upon release, The Lion King was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign which included tie-ins with Burger King, Mattel, Kodak, Nestlé, and Payless ShoeSource, and various merchandise,[71] accounting 186 licensed products.[72][73] In 1994, Disney earned approximately $1 billion with products based on the film,[74] with $214 million for Lion King toys during Christmas 1994 alone.[75]\\n The Lion King had a limited release in the United States on June 15, 1994, playing in only two theaters, El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles and Radio City Music Hall in New York City,[76] and featuring live shows with ticket prices up to $30.[77]\\n The wide release followed on June 24, 1994, in 2,550 screens. The digital surround sound of the film led many of those theaters to implement Dolby Laboratories\\' newest sound systems.[78]\\n When first released in 1994, The Lion King numbered 28 versions overall in as many languages and dialects worldwide, including a special Zulu version made specifically for the film in South Africa, where a Disney USA team went to find the Zulu voice-actors. This is not just the only Zulu dubbing ever made by Disney, but also the only one made in any African language, other than Arabic.[79][80]  The Zulu language version was released in South Africa on November 23, 1994.[81][82]\\n The Lion King marks also the first time a special dubbing is released in honor of a Disney movie background, but not the last: in 2016 the film Moana (2016) received a special Tahitian language version,[83] followed in 2017 by a Māori version,[84] in 2018 by a Hawaiian version;[85] and in 2019 the film Frozen II (2019) was dubbed into Northern Sami, even though Frozen (2013) was not.[86][87] By 2022, 45 language adaptations of the film had been produced.[88] The special Zulu dubbing was made available on the streaming platform Disney+ in October 2022, together with the Māori dubbing of Moana, and the special Arapaho dubbing of Bambi.[89]\\n Following the success of the Māori dub of Moana, a Māori version of The Lion King was announced in 2021, and released theatrically on June 23, 2022, to align with the Māori holiday of Matariki.[90][91] Much of the Matewa Media production team, including producer Chelsea Winstanley, director Tweedie Waititi, and co-musical director Rob Ruha had previously worked on the Māori language version of Moana.[92] The Lion King Reo Māori is the first time a language adaptation has translated Elton John\\'s \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" for the ending credits.[88]\\n The film was re-issued on December 25, 2002, for IMAX and large-format theaters. Don Hahn explained that eight years after The Lion King had its original release, \"there was a whole new generation of kids who haven\\'t really seen it, particularly on the big screen.\" Given the film had already been digitally archived during production, the restoration process was easier, while also providing many scenes with enhancements that covered up original deficiencies.[70][93] An enhanced sound mix was also provided to, as Hahn explained, \"make the audience feel like they\\'re in the middle of the movie.\"[70] On its first weekend, The Lion King made $2.7 million from 66 locations, a $27,664 per theater average. This run ended with $15.7 million on May 30, 2003.[94]\\n In 2011, The Lion King was converted to 3D for a two-week limited theatrical re-issue and subsequent 3D Blu-ray release.[95][96] The film opened at the number one spot on Friday, September 16, 2011, with $8.9 million[97] and finished the weekend with $30.2 million, ranking number one at the box office. This made The Lion King the first re-issue release to earn the number-one slot at the American weekend box office since the re-issue of Return of the Jedi (1983) in March 1997.[98] The film also achieved the fourth-highest September opening weekend of all time.[99] It held off very well on its second weekend, again earning first place at the box office with a 27 percent decline to $21.9 million.[100] Most box-office observers had expected the film to fall about 50 percent in its second weekend and were also expecting Moneyball (2011) to be at first place.[101]\\n After its initial box-office success, many theaters decided to continue to show the film for more than two weeks, even though its 3D Blu-ray release was scheduled for two and a half weeks after its theatrical release.[100] In North America, the 3D re-release ended its run in theaters on January 12, 2012, with a gross of $94.2 million. Outside North America, it earned $83.4 million.[102] The successful 3D re-release of The Lion King made Disney and Pixar plan 3D theatrical re-releases of Beauty and the Beast, Finding Nemo (2003), Monsters, Inc. (2001), and The Little Mermaid (1989) during 2012 and 2013.[103] However, none of the re-releases of the first three films achieved the enormous success of The Lion King 3D and the theatrical re-release of The Little Mermaid was ultimately cancelled.[104] In 2012, Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the 3D version of The Lion King succeeded was because, \"the notion of a 3D re-release was still fresh and exciting, and The Lion King (3D) felt timely given the movie\\'s imminent Blu-ray release. Audiences have been hit with three 3D re-releases in the year since, meaning the novelty value has definitely worn off.\"[105]\\n As part of Disney\\'s 100th anniversary, The Lion King was re-released between September 29 to October 12, 2023, in selected Cinemark theaters across the United States as well as Helios theaters across Poland on October 8.[106][107]\\n In conjunction with the film\\'s 30th anniversary, The Lion King was re-released on July 12, 2024.[108] During its opening weekend, the film earned an estimated $1.08 million in the United States from 1,330 theaters.[109]\\n The Lion King was first released on VHS and LaserDisc in the United States on March 3, 1995, under Disney\\'s \"Masterpiece Collection\" video series. The VHS edition of this release contained a special preview for Walt Disney Pictures\\' then-upcoming animated feature film Pocahontas (1995), in which the title character (voiced by Judy Kuhn) sings the musical number \"Colors of the Wind\".[110] In addition, Deluxe Editions of both formats were released. The VHS Deluxe Edition included the film, an exclusive lithograph of Rafiki and Simba (in some editions), a commemorative \"Circle of Life\" epigraph, six concept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV special The Making of The Lion King, and a certificate of authenticity. The CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs and The Making of The Lion King, and added storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, and a directors\\' commentary that the VHS edition did not have, on a total of four double sided discs. The VHS tape quickly became the best-selling videotape of all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold on the first day[111] and ultimately sales totaled more than 30 million[112] before these home video versions went into moratorium in 1997.[113] The VHS releases have sold a total of 32\\xa0million units in North America,[114] and grossed $520 million in sales revenue.[115] In addition, 23\\xa0million units were shipped overseas to international markets.[116] In the Philippines, the film was released on VHS in March 1995 by Magnavision.[117] The film sold more than 55 million video copies worldwide by August 1997, making it the best-selling home video title of all time.[118]\\n On October 7, 2003, the film was re-released on VHS and released on DVD for the first time, titled The Lion King: Platinum Edition, as part of Disney\\'s Platinum Edition line of DVDs. The DVD release featured two versions of the film on the first disc, a remastered version created for the 2002 IMAX release and an edited version of the IMAX release purporting to be the original 1994 theatrical version.[119] A second disc, with bonus features, was also included in the DVD release. The film\\'s soundtrack was provided both in its original Dolby 5.1 track and in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix, making this one of the first Disney DVDs so equipped.[120] This THX certified two-disc DVD release also contains several games, Timon and Pumbaa\\'s Virtual Safari, deleted scenes, music videos and other bonus features.[121] By means of seamless branching, the film could be viewed either with or without a newly created scene – a short conversation in the film replaced with a complete song (\"The Morning Report\"). A Special Collector\\'s Gift Set was also released, containing the DVD set, five exclusive lithographed character portraits (new sketches created and signed by the original character animators), and an introductory book entitled The Journey.[113] The Platinum Edition of The Lion King featured changes made to the film during its IMAX re-release, including re-drawn crocodiles in the \"I Just Can\\'t Wait to Be King\" sequence as well as other alterations.[119] More than two million copies of the Platinum Edition DVD and VHS units were sold on the first day of release.[111] A DVD box set of the three The Lion King films (in two-disc Special Edition formats) was released on December 6, 2004. In January 2005, the film, along with the sequels, went back into moratorium.[122] The DVD releases have sold a total of 11.9\\xa0million units and grossed $220 million.[123]\\n Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the Diamond Edition of The Lion King on October 4, 2011.[95] This marks the first time that the film has been released in high-definition Blu-ray and on Blu-ray 3D.[95][124] The initial release was produced in three different packages: a two-disc version with Blu-ray and DVD; a four-disc version with Blu-ray, DVD, Blu-ray 3D, and digital copy; and an eight-disc box set that also includes the sequels The Lion King II: Simba\\'s Pride and The Lion King 1½.[95][124] A standalone single-disc DVD release also followed on November 15, 2011.[95] The Diamond Edition topped the Blu-ray charts with over 1.5 million copies sold.[125] The film sold 3.83 million Blu-ray units in total, leading to a $101.14 million income.[126]\\n The Lion King was once again released to home media as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection first released on Digital HD on August 15, 2017, and on Blu-ray and DVD on August 29, 2017.[127]\\n The Lion King was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray and 4K digital download on December 3, 2018.[128]\\n As of July\\xa023, 2024[update], The Lion King grossed $425 million in North America and $553.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $979 million.[2] After its initial run, having earned $763.5 million,[129] it ranked as the highest-grossing animated film of all time, the highest-grossing film of Walt Disney Animation Studios,[130] and the highest-grossing film of 1994.[131] It was the second-highest-grossing film of all time, behind Jurassic Park (1993).[5] The film remained as the second-highest-grossing film until the spot was taken by Independence Day (1996) two years later.[132] It finished as the 5th highest grossing film of the 1990s domestically.[133]\\n It held the record for the highest-grossing animated feature film (in North America, outside North America, and worldwide) until it was surpassed by Finding Nemo (2003). With the earnings of the 3D run, The Lion King surpassed all the aforementioned films but Toy Story 3 (2010) to rank as the second-highest-grossing animated film worldwide—later dropping to ninth, and then tenth, surpassed by its photorealistic CGI remake counterpart—and it remains the highest-grossing hand-drawn animated film.[98] It is also the biggest animated movie of the last 50 years in terms of estimated attendance.[134] The Lion King was also the highest-grossing G-rated film in the United States from 1994 to 2003 and again from 2011 to 2019 until its total was surpassed by Toy Story 4 (2019) (unadjusted for inflation).[135]\\n During the first two days of limited release in two theaters, The Lion King grossed $622,277, and for the weekend it earned nearly $1.6 million, placing the film in tenth place at the box office.[136] The average of $793,377 per theater stands as the largest ever achieved during a weekend,[137] and it was the highest-grossing opening weekend on under 50 screens, beating the record set by Star Wars (1977) from 43 screens.[138] The film grossed nearly $3.8 million from the two theaters in just 10 days.[139]\\n When it opened wide, The Lion King grossed $40.9 million—which at the time was the fourth biggest opening weekend ever and the highest sum for a Disney film—to top the weekend box office. It displaced the previous box office champion Wolf, while also topping Speed and Wyatt Earp.[25][140] At that time, it easily outgrossed the previous biggest 1994 opening, which was the $37.2 million earned by The Flintstones during the four-day Memorial Day weekend. The film also produced the third-highest opening weekend gross of any film, trailing only behind Jurassic Park (1993) and Batman Returns (1992).[141] For five years, the film held the record for having the highest opening weekend for an animated film until it was surpassed by Toy Story 2 (1999).[142] For its second weekend, The Lion King collected a total of $34.2 million, outgrossing the openings of The Shadow, Blown Away and I Love Trouble.[143] It remained the number-one box office film for a total of two weeks until it was displaced by Forrest Gump,[144] followed by True Lies the week after.[145]\\n In September 1994, Disney pulled the film from movie theaters and announced that it would be re-released during Thanksgiving in order to take advantage of the holiday season.[146] At the time, the film had earned $267 million in the United States.[2][147] Upon its re-release in November 1994, it earned $5.5 million during its first weekend, ranking in fourth place behind Star Trek Generations, Interview with the Vampire and The Santa Clause.[148] Following its re-release, by March 1995, it had grossed $312.9 million,[2] being the highest-grossing 1994 film in the United States and Canada, but was soon surpassed by Forrest Gump.[149] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 74 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run,[150] equivalent to $812.1 million adjusted for inflation in 2018.[151]\\n Internationally, the film grossed $455.8 million during its initial run, for a worldwide total of $763.5 million.[129] It had record openings in Sweden and Denmark.[152]\\n On Rotten Tomatoes, The Lion King has an approval rating of 93% with an average score of 8.4/10, based on 137 reviews. The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Emotionally stirring, richly drawn, and beautifully animated, The Lion King stands tall within Disney\\'s pantheon of classic family films.\"[153] It also ranked 56th on Rotten Tomatoes\\' \"Top 100 Animation Movies\".[154] At Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film received a score of 88 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[155] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale.[156]\\n Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of a possible four and called it \"a superbly drawn animated feature\". He further wrote in his print review, \"The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to Hamlet, is a learning experience as well as an entertainment.\"[4] On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to the previous Disney films. Ebert and his partner Gene Siskel both gave the film a \"Thumbs Up\", but Siskel said that it was not as good as Beauty and the Beast and that it was \"a good film, not a great one\".[157] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post called it \"an impressive, almost daunting achievement\" and felt that the film was \"spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney\\'s feature-length animations\". However, he was less enthusiastic toward the end of his review saying, \"Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it is downright strange.\"[158]\\n Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the film, writing that it \"has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie\".[159]\\nRolling Stone film critic Peter Travers praised the film and felt that it was \"a hugely entertaining blend of music, fun, and eye-popping thrills, though it doesn\\'t lack for heart\".[160] James Berardinelli from Reelviews.net praised the film saying, \"With each new animated release, Disney seems to be expanding its already-broad horizons a little more. The Lion King is the most mature (in more than one sense) of these films, and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children. Happily, for those of us who generally stay far away from \\'cartoons\\', they have succeeded.\"[161]\\n Some reviewers still had problems with the film\\'s narrative. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt the film \"is less of a piece than its revered predecessors and the first to have a core story noticeably less involving than its scintillating peripheral characters.\"[162] TV Guide wrote that while The Lion King was technically proficient and entertaining, it \"offers a less memorable song score than did the previous hits, and a hasty, unsatisfying dramatic resolution.\"[163] The New Yorker\\'s Terrence Rafferty considered that despite the good animation, the story felt like \"manipulat[ing] our responses at will\", as \"Between traumas, the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers and silly, rambunctious comedy\".[164]\\n In 2008, The Lion King was ranked as the 319th greatest film ever made by Empire magazine,[186] and in June 2011, TIME named it one of \"The 25 All-TIME Best Animated Films\".[187] In June 2008, the American Film Institute listed The Lion King as the fourth best film in the animation genre in its AFI\\'s 10 Top 10 list,[188] having previously put \"Hakuna Matata\" as 99th on its AFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Songs ranking.[189]\\n In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\\n Protests were raised against one scene where it appears as if the word \"SEX\" might have been embedded into the dust flying in the sky when Simba flops down,[213] which conservative activist Donald Wildmon asserted was a subliminal message intended to promote sexual promiscuity. Animator Tom Sito has stated that the letters spell \"SFX\" (a common abbreviation for \"special effects\"), not with an \"E\" instead of the \"F\", and were intended as an innocent \"signature\" created by the effects animation team.[214]\\n Hyena biologists protested against the animal\\'s portrayal, though the complaints may have been somewhat tongue-in-cheek. One hyena researcher, who had organized the animators\\' visit to the University of California, Berkeley, Field Station for the Study of Behavior, Ecology, and Reproduction, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas,[215] listed \"boycott The Lion King\" in an article listing ways to help preserve hyenas in the wild, and later \"joke[d] that The Lion King set back hyena conservation efforts.\"[216][217] Even so, the film was also credited with \"spark[ing] an interest\" in hyenas at the Berkeley center.[217]\\n The film has been criticized for race and class issues, with the hyenas seen as reflecting negative stereotypes of black and Latino ethnic communities.[218][219][220]\\n Certain elements of the film were thought to bear a resemblance to Osamu Tezuka\\'s 1960s Japanese anime television series Jungle Emperor (known as Kimba the White Lion in the United States), with some similarities between a number of characters and various individual scenes. The 1994 release of The Lion King drew a protest in Japan, where Kimba and its creator Osamu Tezuka are cultural icons. 488 Japanese cartoonists and animators, led by manga author Machiko Satonaka, signed a petition accusing Disney of plagiarism and demanding that they give due credit to Tezuka.[221][222] Matthew Broderick believed initially that he was, in fact, working on an American version of Kimba since he was familiar with the Japanese original.[223]\\n The Lion King director Roger Allers claimed complete unfamiliarity with the series until the movie was nearly completed, and did not remember it being ever mentioned during development.[26] Madhavi Sunder has suggested that Allers might have seen the 1989 remake of Kimba on prime time television while living in Tokyo. However, while Allers did indeed move to Tokyo in 1983 in order to work on Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland (1989), he moved back to the United States in 1985, four years before the 1989 remake of Kimba began airing.[9][224] Co-director Rob Minkoff also stated that he was unfamiliar with it.[225][226] Minkoff also observed that whenever a story is based in Africa, it is \"not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird, or hyenas.\"[225]\\n Takayuki Matsutani, the president of Tezuka Productions which created Kimba the White Lion, said in 1994 that \"quite a few staff of our company saw a preview of The Lion King, discussed this subject and came to the conclusion that you cannot avoid having these similarities as long as you use animals as characters and try to draw images out of them\".[227] Yoshihiro Shimizu of Tezuka Productions has refuted rumors that the studio was paid hush money by Disney and stated that they have no interest in suing Disney, explaining that \"we think it\\'s a totally different story\". Shimizu further explained that they rejected urges from some American lawyers to sue because \"we\\'re a small, weak company... Disney\\'s lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!\"[228] Tezuka\\'s family and Tezuka Productions never pursued litigation.[229]\\n Fred Ladd, who was involved early on with importing Kimba and other Japanese anime into America for NBC, expressed incredulity that Disney\\'s people could remain ignorant.[230][226] Ladd stated there was at least one animator remembered by his colleagues as being an avid Kimba fan and being quite vociferous about Disney\\'s conduct during production.[230] Animators Tom Sito and Mark Kausler have both stated that they had watched Kimba as children in the 1960s. However, Sito maintains there was \"absolutely no inspiration\" from Kimba during the production of The Lion King, and Kausler emphasized Disney\\'s own Bambi as being their model during development.[231][227]\\n The controversy surrounding Kimba and The Lion King was parodied in The Simpsons episode \"\\'Round Springfield\", where Mufasa appears through the clouds and says, \"You must avenge my death, Kimba... I mean, Simba.\"[232]\\n The first Lion King–related animated project was the spin-off television series, The Lion King\\'s Timon & Pumbaa, which centers on the characters of Timon and Pumbaa, as they have their own (mis)adventures both within\\' and outside of the Serengeti. The show ran for three seasons and 85 episodes between 1995 and 1999. Ernie Sabella continued to voice Pumbaa, while Timon was voiced by Quinton Flynn and Kevin Schon in addition to Nathan Lane.[233] One of the show\\'s music video segments \"Stand By Me\", featuring Timon singing the eponymous song, was later edited into an animated short which was released in 1995, accompanying the theatrical release of Tom and Huck (1995).\\n Disney released two direct-to-video films related to The Lion King. The first was sequel The Lion King II: Simba\\'s Pride, released in 1998 on VHS. The film centers around Simba and Nala\\'s daughter, Kiara, who falls in love with Kovu, a male lion who was raised in a pride of Scar\\'s followers, the Outsiders.[234] The Lion King 1½, another direct-to-video Lion King film, saw its release in 2004. It is a prequel in showing how Timon and Pumbaa met each other, and also a parallel in that it also depicts what the characters were retconned to have done during the events of the original movie.[235]\\n In June 2014, it was announced that a new TV series based on the film would be released called The Lion Guard, featuring Kion, the second-born cub of Simba and Nala. The Lion Guard is a sequel to The Lion King and takes place during the time-gap within The Lion King II: Simba\\'s Pride,[236] with the last 2 episodes of Season 3 taking place after the events of that film. It was first broadcast on Disney Channel as a television film titled The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar in November 2015 before airing as a series on Disney Junior in January 2016.[237][238]\\n In September 2016, following the critical and financial success of The Jungle Book, Walt Disney Pictures announced that they were developing a CGI remake of The Lion King by the same name, with Jon Favreau directing.[239] The following month, Jeff Nathanson was hired to write the script for the film.[240] Favreau originally planned to shoot it back-to-back with the sequel to The Jungle Book.[239][241] However, it was reported in early 2017 that the latter film was put on hold in order for Favreau to instead focus mainly on The Lion King.[242] In February 2017, Favreau announced that Donald Glover had been cast as Simba and that James Earl Jones would be reprising the role of Mufasa.[243] The following month, it was reported that Beyoncé was Favreau\\'s top choice to voice Nala, but she had not accepted the role yet due to a pregnancy.[244] In April 2017, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen joined the film as Timon and Pumbaa, respectively.[245] Two months later, John Oliver was cast as Zazu.[246] At the end of July 2017, Beyoncé had reportedly entered final negotiations to play Nala and contribute a new soundtrack.[247] The following month, Chiwetel Ejiofor entered talks to play Scar.[248] Later on, Alfre Woodard and John Kani joined the film as Sarabi and Rafiki, respectively.[249][250] On November 1, 2017, Beyoncé and Chiwetel Ejiofor were officially confirmed to voice Nala and Scar, with Eric André, Florence Kasumba, Keegan-Michael Key, JD McCrary, and Shahadi Wright Joseph joining the cast as the voices of Azizi, Shenzi, and Kamari, young Simba, and young Nala, respectively, while Hans Zimmer would return to score the film\\'s music.[251][252][253][254][255] On November 28, 2017, it was reported that Elton John had signed onto the project to rework his musical compositions from the original film.[256]\\n Production for the film began in May 2017.[257] It was released on July 19, 2019.[258]\\n In June 2020, Parkwood Entertainment and Disney announced that a film titled Black Is King would be released on July 31, 2020, on Disney+. The live-action film is inspired by The Lion King (2019) and serves as a visual album for the tie-in album The Lion King: The Gift, which was curated by Beyoncé for the film.[259] Directed, written and executive produced by Beyoncé, Black Is King is described as reimagining \"the lessons of The Lion King for today\\'s young kings and queens in search of their own crowns\".[260] The film chronicles the story of a young African king who undergoes a \"transcendent journey through betrayal, love and self-identity\" to reclaim his throne, utilizing the guidance of his ancestors and childhood love, with the story being told through the voices of present-day Black people.[261] The cast includes Lupita Nyong\\'o, Naomi Campbell, Jay-Z, Kelly Rowland, Pharrell Williams, Tina Knowles-Lawson, Aweng Ade-Chuol, and Adut Akech.[260]\\n On September 29, 2020, Deadline Hollywood reported that a follow-up film was in development with Barry Jenkins attached to direct.[262] While The Hollywood Reporter said the film would be a prequel about Mufasa during his formative years, Deadline said it would be a sequel centering on both Mufasa\\'s origins and the events after the first film, similar to The Godfather Part II. Jeff Nathanson, the screenwriter for the remake, has reportedly finished a draft.[263][264] In August 2021, it was reported that Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr. had been cast as Mufasa and Scar respectively.[265] The film will not be a remake of The Lion King II: Simba\\'s Pride, the 1998 direct-to-video sequel to the original animated film.[266] In September 2022 at the D23 Expo, it was announced that the film will be titled Mufasa: The Lion King and it will follow the titular character\\'s origin story. Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, and John Kani will reprise their roles as Pumbaa, Timon, and Rafiki, respectively. The film is scheduled for release on December 20, 2024.[267]\\n Along with the film release, three different video games based on The Lion King were released by Virgin Interactive in December 1994. The main title was developed by Westwood Studios, and published for PC and Amiga computers and the consoles SNES and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. Dark Technologies created the Game Boy version, while Syrox Developments handled the Master System and Game Gear version.[268] The film and sequel Simba\\'s Pride later inspired another game, Torus Games\\' The Lion King: Simba\\'s Mighty Adventure (2000) for the Game Boy Color and PlayStation.[269] Timon and Pumbaa also appeared in Timon & Pumbaa\\'s Jungle Games, a 1995 PC game collection of puzzle games by 7th Level, later ported to the SNES by Tiertex.[270]\\n The Square Enix series Kingdom Hearts features Simba as a recurring summon,[271][272] as well as a playable in the Lion King world, known as Pride Lands, in Kingdom Hearts II. There the plotline is loosely related to the later part of the original film, with all of the main characters except Zazu and Sarabi.[273] The Lion King also provides one of the worlds featured in the 2011 action-adventure game Disney Universe,[274] and Simba was featured in the Nintendo DS title Disney Friends (2008).[275] The video game Disney Magic Kingdoms includes some characters of the film and some attractions based on locations of the film as content to unlock for a limited time.[276][277]\\n Walt Disney Theatrical produced a musical stage adaptation of the same name, which premiered in Minneapolis, Minnesota in July 1997, and later opened on Broadway in October 1997 at the New Amsterdam Theatre. The Lion King musical was directed by Julie Taymor[278] and featured songs from both the movie and Rhythm of the Pride Lands, along with three new compositions by Elton John and Tim Rice. Mark Mancina did the musical arrangements and new orchestral tracks.[279] To celebrate the African culture background the story is based on, there are six indigenous African languages sung and spoken throughout the show: Swahili, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, Congolese.[280] The musical became one of the most successful in Broadway history, winning six Tony Awards including Best Musical, and despite moving to the Minskoff Theatre in 2006, is still running to this day in New York, becoming the third longest-running show and highest grossing Broadway production in history. The show\\'s financial success led to adaptations all over the world.[24][281][282]\\n The Lion King inspired two attractions retelling the story of the film at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The first, \"The Legend of the Lion King\", featured a recreation of the film through life-size puppets of its characters, and ran from 1994 to 2002 at Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World.[283] Another that is still running is the live-action 30-minute musical revue of the movie, \"Festival of the Lion King\", which incorporates the musical numbers into gymnastic routines with live actors, along with animatronic puppets of Simba and Pumbaa and a costumed actor as Timon. The attraction opened in April 1998 at Disney World\\'s Animal Kingdom,[284] and in September 2005 in Hong Kong Disneyland\\'s Adventureland.[285] A similar version under the name \"The Legend of the Lion King\" was featured in Disneyland Paris from 2004 to 2009.[286][287]', 'Winnie-the-Pooh (also known as Edward Bear, Pooh Bear or simply Pooh) is a fictional anthropomorphic teddy bear created by English author A. A. Milne and English illustrator E. H. Shepard. Winnie-the-Pooh first appeared by name in a children\\'s story commissioned by London\\'s Evening News for Christmas Eve 1925. The character is inspired by a stuffed toy that Milne had bought for his son Christopher Robin in Harrods department store, and a bear they had viewed at London Zoo.\\n The first collection of stories about the character was the book Winnie-the-Pooh (1926), and this was followed by The House at Pooh Corner (1928). Milne also included a poem about the bear in the children\\'s verse book When We Were Very Young (1924) and many more in Now We Are Six (1927). All four volumes were illustrated by E. H. Shepard. The stories are set in Hundred Acre Wood, which was inspired by Five Hundred Acre Wood in Ashdown Forest in East Sussex—situated 30 miles (48\\xa0km) south of London—where the Londoner Milne\\'s country home was located.\\n The Pooh stories have been translated into many languages, including Alexander Lenard\\'s Latin translation, Winnie ille Pu, which was first published in 1958, and, in 1960, became the only Latin book ever to have been featured on The New York Times Best Seller list.[1] The original English manuscripts are held at Wren Library, Trinity College, Cambridge, Milne\\'s alma mater to whom he had bequeathed the works.[2] The first Pooh story was ranked number 7 on the BBC\\'s The Big Read poll.[3]\\n In 1961, The Walt Disney Company licensed certain film and other rights of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories from the estate of A. A. Milne and the licensing agent Stephen Slesinger, Inc., and adapted the Pooh stories, using the unhyphenated name \"Winnie the Pooh\", into a series of features that would eventually become one of its most successful franchises. In popular film adaptations, Pooh has been voiced by actors Sterling Holloway, Hal Smith, and Jim Cummings in English, and Yevgeny Leonov in Russian.\\n A. A. Milne named the character Winnie-the-Pooh after a teddy bear owned by his son, Christopher Robin Milne, on whom the character Christopher Robin was based. Shepard in turn based his illustrations of Pooh on his own son\\'s teddy bear named Growler, instead of Christopher Robin\\'s bear.[4] The rest of Christopher Milne\\'s toys – Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo, and Tigger – were incorporated into Milne\\'s stories.[5][6] Two more characters, Owl and Rabbit, were created by Milne\\'s imagination, while Gopher was added to the Disney version. Christopher Robin\\'s toy bear is on display at the Main Branch of the New York Public Library in New York City.[7]\\n In 1921, Milne bought his son Christopher Robin the toy bear from Harrods department store.[8][9] Christopher Robin had named his toy bear Edward, then Winnie, after a Canadian black bear Winnie that he often saw at London Zoo, and Pooh, a friend\\'s pet swan they had encountered while on holiday.[10][11] The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for C$20 by Canadian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn in White River, Ontario, while en route to England during the First World War.[12] Colebourn, a veterinary officer with the Fort Garry Horse cavalry regiment, named the bear Winnie after his adopted hometown in Winnipeg, Manitoba.[13][14] Winnie was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as The Fort Garry Horse regimental mascot. Colebourn left Winnie at the London Zoo while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially donated to the zoo, as she had become a much-loved attraction there.[15] Pooh the swan appears as a character in its own right in When We Were Very Young.\\n In the first chapter of Winnie-the-Pooh, Milne offers this explanation of why Winnie-the-Pooh is often simply known as \"Pooh\":\\n But his arms were so stiff … they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week, and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off. And I think – but I am not sure – that that is why he is always called Pooh. American writer William Safire surmised that the Milnes\\' invention of the name \"Winnie the Pooh\" may have also been influenced by the haughty character Pooh-Bah in Gilbert and Sullivan\\'s The Mikado (1885).[17]\\n The Winnie-the-Pooh stories are set in Ashdown Forest, East Sussex, England. The forest is an area of tranquil open heathland on the highest sandy ridges of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty situated 30 miles (50\\xa0km) south-east of London. In 1925 Milne, a Londoner, bought a country home a mile to the north of the forest at Cotchford Farm, near Hartfield. According to Christopher Robin Milne, while his father continued to live in London \"...the four of us – he, his wife, his son and his son\\'s nanny – would pile into a large blue, chauffeur-driven Fiat and travel down every Saturday morning and back again every Monday afternoon. And we would spend a whole glorious month there in the spring and two months in the summer.\"[18] From the front lawn the family had a view across a meadow to a line of alders that fringed the River Medway, beyond which the ground rose through more trees until finally \"above them, in the faraway distance, crowning the view, was a bare hilltop. In the centre of this hilltop was a clump of pines.\" Most of his father\\'s visits to the forest at that time were, he noted, family expeditions on foot \"to make yet another attempt to count the pine trees on Gill\\'s Lap or to search for the marsh gentian\". Christopher added that, inspired by Ashdown Forest, his father had made it \"the setting for two of his books, finishing the second little over three years after his arrival\".[19]\\n Many locations in the stories can be associated with real places in and around the forest. As Christopher Milne wrote in his autobiography: \"Pooh\\'s forest and Ashdown Forest are identical.\" For example, the fictional \"Hundred Acre Wood\" was in reality Five Hundred Acre Wood; Galleon\\'s Leap was inspired by the prominent hilltop of Gill\\'s Lap, while a clump of trees just north of Gill\\'s Lap became Christopher Robin\\'s The Enchanted Place, because no-one had ever been able to count whether there were 63 or 64 trees in the circle.[20]\\n The landscapes depicted in E. H. Shepard\\'s illustrations for the Winnie-the-Pooh books were directly inspired by the distinctive landscape of Ashdown Forest, with its high, open heathlands of heather, gorse, bracken and silver birch, punctuated by hilltop clumps of pine trees. Many of Shepard\\'s illustrations can be matched to actual views, allowing for a degree of artistic licence. Shepard\\'s sketches of pine trees and other forest scenes are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.[21]\\n The game of Poohsticks was originally played by Christopher Robin Milne and his father on the wooden footbridge,[22] across the Millbrook,[23] Posingford Wood, close to Cotchford Farm. In the stories Pooh plays the game with the other characters, Christopher Robin, Tigger, and Eeyore.[24] The location is now a tourist attraction, and it has become traditional to play the game there using sticks gathered in the nearby woodland.[22][25] When the footbridge had to be replaced in 1999, the architect used as a main source drawings by Shepard in the books, and retained its precursor\\'s original style.[26]\\n  Christopher Robin\\'s teddy bear made his character début, under the name Edward, in A. A. Milne\\'s poem, \"Teddy Bear\", in the edition of 13 February 1924 of Punch (E. H. Shepard had also included a similar bear in a cartoon published in Punch the previous week[27]), and the same poem was published in Milne\\'s book of children\\'s verse When We Were Very Young (6 November 1924).[28] Winnie-the-Pooh first appeared by name on 24 December 1925, in a Christmas story commissioned and published by the London newspaper Evening News. It was illustrated by J. H. Dowd.[29]\\n The first collection of Pooh stories appeared in the book Winnie-the-Pooh. The Evening News Christmas story reappeared as the first chapter of the book. At the beginning, it explained that Pooh was in fact Christopher Robin\\'s Edward Bear, who had been renamed by the boy. He was renamed after an American black bear at London Zoo called Winnie who got her name from the fact that her owner had come from Winnipeg, Canada. The book was published in October 1926 by the publisher of Milne\\'s earlier children\\'s work, Methuen, in England, E. P. Dutton in the United States, and McClelland & Stewart in Canada.[30] The book was an immediate critical and commercial success.[31] The children\\'s author and literary critic John Rowe Townsend described Winnie-the-Pooh and its sequel The House at Pooh Corner as \"the spectacular British success of the 1920s\" and praised its light, readable prose.[32]\\n The original drawing of Pooh was based not on Christopher Robin\\'s bear, but on Growler, the teddy bear belonging to Shepard\\'s son Graham, according to James Campbell, husband of Shepard\\'s great-granddaughter. When Campbell took over Shepard\\'s estate in 2010, he discovered many drawings and unpublished writings, including early drawings of Pooh, that had not been seen in decades. Campbell said, \"Both he and A. A. Milne realised that Christopher Robin\\'s bear was too gruff-looking, not very cuddly, so they decided they would have to have a different bear for the illustrations.\"[33] Campbell said Shepard sent Milne a drawing of his son\\'s bear and that Milne \"said it was perfect\". Campbell also said Shepard\\'s drawings of Christopher Robin were based partly on his own son.[33]\\n In the Milne books, Pooh is naive and slow-witted, but he is also friendly, thoughtful, and steadfast. Although he and his friends agree that he is \"a bear of very little brain\", Pooh is occasionally acknowledged to have a clever idea, usually driven by common sense. These include riding in Christopher Robin\\'s umbrella to rescue Piglet from a flood, discovering \"the North Pole\" by picking it up to help fish Roo out of the river, inventing the game of Poohsticks, and getting Eeyore out of the river by dropping a large rock on one side of him to wash him towards the bank.\\n Pooh is also a talented poet and the stories are frequently punctuated by his poems and \"hums\". Although he is humble about his slow-wittedness, he is comfortable with his creative gifts. When Owl\\'s house blows down in a windstorm, trapping Pooh, Piglet and Owl inside, Pooh encourages Piglet (the only one small enough to do so) to escape and rescue them all by promising that \"a respectful Pooh song\" will be written about Piglet\\'s feat. Later, Pooh muses about the creative process as he composes the song.\\n Pooh is very fond of food, particularly honey (which he spells \"hunny\"), but also condensed milk and other items. When he visits friends, his desire to be offered a snack is in conflict with the impoliteness of asking too directly. Though intent on giving Eeyore a pot of honey for his birthday, Pooh could not resist eating it on his way to deliver the present and so instead gives Eeyore \"a useful pot to put things in\". When he and Piglet are lost in the forest during Rabbit\\'s attempt to \"unbounce\" Tigger, Pooh finds his way home by following the \"call\" of the honeypots from his house. Pooh makes it a habit to have \"a little something\" around 11:00 in the morning. As the clock in his house \"stopped at five minutes to eleven some weeks ago\", any time can be Pooh\\'s snack time.\\n Pooh is very social. After Christopher Robin, his closest friend is Piglet, and he most often chooses to spend his time with one or both of them. But he also habitually visits the other animals, often looking for a snack or an audience for his poetry as much as for companionship. His kind-heartedness means he goes out of his way to be friendly to Eeyore, visiting him and bringing him a birthday present and building him a house, despite receiving mostly disdain from Eeyore in return. Devan Coggan of Entertainment Weekly saw a similarity between Pooh and Paddington Bear, two \"extremely polite British bears without pants\", adding that \"both bears share a philosophy of kindness and integrity\".[34]\\n An authorised sequel Return to the Hundred Acre Wood was published on 5 October 2009. The author, David Benedictus, has developed, but not changed, Milne\\'s characterisations. The illustrations, by Mark Burgess, are in the style of Shepard.[35]\\n Another authorised sequel, Winnie-the-Pooh: The Best Bear in All the World, was published by Egmont in 2016. The sequel consists of four short stories by four leading children\\'s authors, Kate Saunders, Brian Sibley, Paul Bright, and Jeanne Willis. Illustrations are by Mark Burgess.[36] The Best Bear in All The World sees the introduction of a new character, Penguin, which was inspired by a long-lost photograph of Milne and his son Christopher with a toy penguin.[37][38]\\n In 2016, Winnie-the-Pooh Meets the Queen was published to mark the 90th anniversary of Milne\\'s creation and the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II. It sees Pooh meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace.[39]\\n In 2021, marking a century since Milne bought the stuffed toy from Harrods department store for his son Christopher Robin that would inspire Milne to create the character, Winnie-the-Pooh: Once There Was a Bear, the first prequel to Milne\\'s books and poetry about the bear, was authorised by the estates of Milne and Shepard.[8] Inspired by the real life of Christopher Robin, it is written by children\\'s writer Jane Riordan in the style of Milne, with illustrations by Mark Burgess emulating the drawings of Shepard.[8] It sees Winnie-the-Pooh exploring Harrods as well as visit London\\'s Natural History Museum and London Zoo, before leaving London and going back to the Hundred Acre Wood.[8]\\n On 6 January 1930, Stephen Slesinger purchased US and Canadian merchandising, television, recording, and other trade rights to the Winnie-the-Pooh works from Milne for a $1,000 advance and 66% of Slesinger\\'s income.[40] By November 1931, Pooh was a $50\\xa0million-a-year business.[41] Slesinger marketed Pooh and his friends for more than 30 years, creating the first Pooh doll, record, board game, puzzle, US radio broadcast (on NBC), animation, and motion picture.[42]\\n The first time Pooh and his friends appeared in colour was 1932, when he was drawn by Slesinger in his now-familiar red shirt and featured on an RCA Victor picture record. Parker Brothers introduced A. A. Milne\\'s Winnie-the-Pooh Game in 1933, again with Pooh in his red shirt. In the 1940s, Agnes Brush created the first plush dolls with Pooh in a shirt.[43][44]\\n After Slesinger\\'s death in 1953, his wife, Shirley Slesinger Lasswell, continued developing the character herself. In 1961, she licensed rights to Walt Disney Productions in exchange for royalties in the first of two agreements between Stephen Slesinger, Inc., and Disney.[45] The same year, A. A. Milne\\'s widow, Daphne Milne, also licensed certain rights, including motion picture rights, to Disney.\\n Since 1966, Disney has released numerous animated productions starring its version of Winnie the Pooh and related characters, starting with the theatrical featurette Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree. This was followed by Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968), and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too (1974). These three featurettes were combined into a feature-length film, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, in 1977. A fourth featurette, Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore, was released in 1983.\\n A new series of Winnie the Pooh theatrical feature-length films launched in the 2000s, with The Tigger Movie (2000), Piglet\\'s Big Movie (2003), Pooh\\'s Heffalump Movie (2005), and Winnie the Pooh (2011).\\n Disney has also produced television series based on the franchise, including Welcome to Pooh Corner (Disney Channel, 1983–1986), The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (ABC, 1988–1991), The Book of Pooh (Playhouse Disney, 2001–2003), and My Friends Tigger & Pooh (Playhouse Disney, 2007–2010).\\n A. A. Milne\\'s U.S. copyright on the Winnie-the-Pooh character expired on 1 January 2022, as it had been 95 years since publication of the first story. The character has thus entered the public domain in the United States and Disney no longer holds exclusive rights there. Independent filmmaker Rhys Frake-Waterfield capitalized on this shortly thereafter by producing a horror film titled Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey.[46] The UK copyright will expire on 1 January 2027, the 70th year since Milne\\'s death.[47]\\n Playdate with Winnie the Pooh, an animated series of musical shorts by OddBot Inc. for Disney Junior, became the first project from Disney to be released after the original book and characters became public domain.[48][49][50][51]\\n Pooh videos, soft toys, and other merchandise generate substantial annual revenues for Disney. The size of Pooh stuffed toys ranges from Beanie and miniature to human-sized. In addition to the stylised Disney Pooh, Disney markets Classic Pooh merchandise which more closely resembles E. H. Shepard\\'s illustrations.\\n In 1991, Stephen Slesinger, Inc., filed a lawsuit against Disney which alleged that Disney had breached their 1983 agreement by again failing to accurately report revenue from Winnie the Pooh sales. Under this agreement, Disney was to retain approximately 98% of gross worldwide revenues while the remaining 2% was to be paid to Slesinger. In addition, the suit alleged that Disney had failed to pay required royalties on all commercial exploitation of the product name.[52] Though the Disney corporation was sanctioned by a judge for destroying forty boxes of evidentiary documents,[53] the suit was later terminated by another judge when it was discovered that Slesinger\\'s investigator had rummaged through Disney\\'s garbage to retrieve the discarded evidence.[54] Slesinger appealed the termination and, on 26 September 2007, a three-judge panel upheld the lawsuit dismissal.[55]\\n After the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, Clare Milne, Christopher Robin Milne\\'s daughter, attempted to terminate any future US copyrights for Stephen Slesinger, Inc.[56] After a series of legal hearings, Judge Florence-Marie Cooper of the US District Court in California found in favour of Stephen Slesinger, Inc., as did the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On 26 June 2006, the US Supreme Court refused to hear the case, sustaining the ruling and ensuring the defeat of the suit.[57]\\n On 19 February 2007, Disney lost a court case in Los Angeles which ruled their \"misguided claims\" to dispute the licensing agreements with Slesinger, Inc., were unjustified,[58] but a federal ruling of 28 September 2009, again from Judge Florence-Marie Cooper, determined that the Slesinger family had granted all trademarks and copyrights to Disney, although Disney must pay royalties for all future use of the characters. Both parties expressed satisfaction with the outcome.[59][60]\\n Selected Pooh stories read by Maurice Evans released on vinyl LP:\\n In 1951, RCA Records released four stories of Winnie-the-Pooh, narrated by Jimmy Stewart and featuring the voices of Cecil Roy as Pooh, Madeleine Pierce as Piglet, Betty Jane Tyler as Kanga, Merrill Joels as Eeyore, Arnold Stang as Rabbit, Frank Milano as Owl, and Sandy Fussell as Christopher Robin.[65]\\n In 1960, HMV recorded a dramatised version with songs (music by Harold Fraser-Simson) of two episodes from The House at Pooh Corner (Chapters 2 and 8), starring Ian Carmichael as Pooh, Denise Bryer as Christopher Robin (who also narrated), Hugh Lloyd as Tigger, Penny Morrell as Piglet, and Terry Norris as Eeyore. This was released on a 45\\xa0rpm EP.[66]\\n In the 1970s and 1980s, Carol Channing recorded Winnie the Pooh, The House at Pooh Corner and The Winnie the Pooh Songbook, with music by Don Heckman. These were released on vinyl LP and audio cassette by Caedmon Records.\\n Unabridged recordings read by Peter Dennis of the four Pooh books:\\n In 1979, a double audio cassette set of Winnie the Pooh was produced featuring British actor Lionel Jeffries reading all of the characters in the stories. This was followed in 1981 by an audio cassette set of stories from The House at Pooh Corner also read by Lionel Jeffries.[67]\\n In the 1990s, the stories were dramatised for audio by David Benedictus, with music composed, directed and played by John Gould. They were performed by a cast that included Stephen Fry as Winnie-the-Pooh, Jane Horrocks as Piglet, Geoffrey Palmer as Eeyore, Judi Dench as Kanga, Finty Williams as Roo, Robert Daws as Rabbit, Michael Williams as Owl, Steven Webb as Christopher Robin and Sandi Toksvig as Tigger.[68]\\n In the Soviet Union, three Winnie-the-Pooh, (transcribed in Russian as Винни-Пух, Vinni Pukh) stories were made into a celebrated trilogy.[77][78]\\n The films used Boris Zakhoder\\'s translation of the book. Pooh was voiced by Yevgeny Leonov. Unlike in the Disney adaptations, the animators did not base their depictions of the characters on Shepard\\'s illustrations, instead creating a different look. The Soviet adaptations made extensive use of Milne\\'s original text and often brought out aspects of Milne\\'s characters\\' personalities not used in the Disney adaptations.\\n Maev Kennedy of The Guardian called Winnie-the-Pooh \"the most famous bear in literary history\".[85] One of the best-known characters in British children\\'s literature, a 2011 poll saw the bear voted onto the list of top 100 \"icons of England\".[86] In 2003 the first Pooh story was ranked number 7 on the BBC\\'s The Big Read poll.[3] Forbes magazine ranked Pooh the most valuable fictional character in 2002, with merchandising products alone generating more than $5.9\\xa0billion that year.[87] In 2005, Pooh generated $6\\xa0billion, a figure surpassed by only Mickey Mouse.[88] In 2006, Pooh received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, marking the 80th birthday of Milne\\'s creation.[88] In 2010, E. H. Shepard\\'s original illustrations of Winnie the Pooh (and other Pooh characters) featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail.[89]\\n Winnie the Pooh has inspired multiple texts to explain complex philosophical ideas. Benjamin Hoff uses Milne\\'s characters in The Tao of Pooh and The Te of Piglet to explain Taoism. Similarly, Frederick Crews wrote essays about the Pooh books in abstruse academic jargon in The Pooh Perplex and Postmodern Pooh to satirise a range of philosophical approaches.[90] Pooh and the Philosophers by John T. Williams uses Winnie the Pooh as a backdrop to illustrate the works of philosophers, including Descartes, Kant, Plato and Nietzsche.[91] \"Epic Pooh\" is a 1978 essay by Michael Moorcock that compares much fantasy writing to A. A. Milne\\'s, as work intended to comfort, not challenge.\\n In music, Kenny Loggins wrote the song \"House at Pooh Corner\", which was originally recorded by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.[92] Loggins later rewrote the song as \"Return to Pooh Corner\", featuring on the album of the same name in 1991. In Italy, a pop band took their name from Winnie, and were titled Pooh. In Estonia, there is a punk/metal band called Winny Puhh. There is a street in Warsaw, Poland, named after the character, the Kubusia Puchatka Street, as he is known in Polish translations as Kubuś Puchatek.[93] There is also a street named after him in Budapest, Hungary, the Micimackó Street.[94]\\n In the \"sport\" of Poohsticks, competitors drop sticks into a stream from a bridge and then wait to see whose stick will cross the finish line first. Competitors hold their sticks at arms length at the same height, then drop their sticks into the water at the same time.[95] Though it began as a game played by Pooh and his friends in the book The House at Pooh Corner and later in the films, it has crossed over into the real world: a World Championship Poohsticks race takes place in Oxfordshire each year. Ashdown Forest in south-east England, where the Pooh stories are set, is a popular tourist attraction, and includes the wooden Pooh Bridge where Pooh and Piglet invented Poohsticks.[96] The Oxford University Winnie the Pooh Society was founded by undergraduates in 1982.[97]\\n From December 2017 to April 2018, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London hosted the exhibition Winnie-the-Pooh: Exploring a Classic.[98] On exhibit were A. A. Milne\\'s manuscript of Winnie-the-Pooh and The House at Pooh Corner (on loan from the Wren Library at Trinity College, Cambridge, Milne\\'s alma mater to whom he had bequeathed the works), and teddy bears that had not been on display for some 40 years because they were so fragile.[85][99]\\n In 2018, E. H. Shepard\\'s original 1926 illustrated map of the Hundred Acre Wood, which features in the opening pages of Milne\\'s books and also appears in the opening animation in the first Disney adaptation in 1966, sold for £430,000 ($600,000) at Sotheby\\'s in London, setting a world record for book illustrations.[100][101]\\n The Japanese figure skater and two-time Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu regards Pooh as his lucky charm.[102] He is usually seen with a stuffed Winnie-the-Pooh during his figure skating competitions. Because of this, Hanyu\\'s fans will throw stuffed Winnie-the-Poohs onto the ice after his performance.[103] After one of Hanyu\\'s performances at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, one spectator remarked that \"the ice turned yellow\" because of all the Poohs thrown onto the ice.[104]\\n In China, images of Pooh were censored from social media websites in mid-2017, when Internet memes comparing Chinese Paramount Leader and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi Jinping to (Disney\\'s version of) Pooh became popular.[105] The 2018 film Christopher Robin was also denied a Chinese release.[106]\\n When Xi visited the Philippines, protestors posted images of Pooh on social media.[107] Other politicians have been compared to Winnie-the-Pooh characters alongside Xi, including Barack Obama as Tigger, Carrie Lam, Rodrigo Duterte,[108] and Peng Liyuan as Piglet,[109] and Fernando Chui and Shinzo Abe as Eeyore.[110]\\n Pooh\\'s Chinese name (Chinese: 小熊维尼; lit. \\'little bear Winnie\\') has been censored from video games such as World of Warcraft, PlayerUnknown\\'s Battlegrounds, Arena of Valor,[111] and Devotion.[112] Images of Pooh in Kingdom Hearts III were also blurred out on the gaming site A9VG.[113]\\n Despite the ban, two Pooh-themed rides still operate in Disneyland Shanghai, and it is also legal to purchase Pooh-bear merchandise and books about Winnie the Pooh in China.[114][115] In May 2021, a performer dressed up as Winnie-the-Pooh in Shanghai Disneyland was beaten by a child tourist. Mass media in China used the term \"Pooh Pooh Bear\" (Chinese: 噗噗熊) in reports about this incident because the word \"Winnie\" has been censored. However, search results of \"Pooh Pooh Bear hurt in Shanghai Disneyland\" were censored on Weibo after this incident happened.[116][117]\\n In October 2019, Pooh was featured in the South Park episode \"Band in China\" as a prisoner in China because of his alleged resemblance with Xi. In the episode, Pooh is brutally killed by Randy Marsh. South Park was banned in China as a result of the episode.[118][119]\\n Taiwanese pilots have worn morale patches which feature a Formosan black bear punching Winnie-the-Pooh in the face.[120] The patches are produced by a private company and demand for them surged greatly after pictures of active duty personal wearing them began circulating.[121][122]', 'The Princess and the Frog is a 2009 American animated musical romantic fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is inspired in part by the 2002 novel The Frog Princess by E. D. Baker, which in turn is based on the German folk tale \"The Frog Prince\" as collected by the Brothers Grimm. The film was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements and produced by Peter Del Vecho, from a screenplay that Clements and Musker co-wrote with Rob Edwards. The directors also co-wrote the story with the writing team of Greg Erb and Jason Oremland. The film stars the voices of Anika Noni Rose, Bruno Campos, Michael-Leon Wooley, Jim Cummings, Jennifer Cody, John Goodman, Keith David, Peter Bartlett, Jenifer Lewis, Oprah Winfrey, and Terrence Howard. Set in New Orleans during the 1920s, the film tells the story of a hardworking waitress named Tiana who dreams of opening her own restaurant. After kissing prince Naveen, who has been turned into a frog by the evil voodoo witch doctor Facilier, Tiana becomes a frog as well and the two must find a way to turn human again before it is too late.\\n The Princess and the Frog began production in July 2006, under the working title The Frog Princess. It marked Disney\\'s brief return to traditional animation, as it was the mainstream animation studio\\'s first traditionally animated film since Home on the Range (2004). Musker and Clements, directors of Disney\\'s The Great Mouse Detective (1986), The Little Mermaid (1989), Aladdin (1992), Hercules (1997), and Treasure Planet (2002) returned to Disney to direct The Princess and the Frog. The studio returned to a Broadway musical-style format frequently used during the Disney Renaissance, and the film features a score and songs composed and conducted by Randy Newman, well known for his musical involvement in Pixar films such as the Toy Story franchise.\\n The Princess and the Frog premiered at the Roy E. Disney Animation Building on the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank on November 15, 2009, and first opened in a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on November 25, followed by its wide release on December 11. The film received largely positive reviews from critics, who praised the animation (particularly the revival of the hand-drawn form), characters, music, voice acting (particularly David\\'s), and themes; however, it was criticized for its depiction of Louisiana Voodoo and alleged historical negationism of its depiction of the Southern United States during the Jim Crow era. It was a qualified success at the box office: it somewhat underperformed Disney\\'s targets yet finished in first place in North America on its opening weekend and grossed around $271 million worldwide (becoming, in the process, Disney’s most successful traditionally animated film since Lilo & Stitch in 2002). It received three Oscar nominations at the 82nd Academy Awards: one for Best Animated Feature and two for Best Original Song.[4]\\n In New Orleans during the Roaring Twenties, a young woman named Tiana dreams of opening a restaurant. She works two waitress jobs to earn the money she needs, leaving no time for a social life. Naveen, the arrogant prince of Maldonia, arrives in New Orleans. His parents have cut him off from the family fortune, so he intends to marry Charlotte La Bouff, Tiana\\'s best friend. Charlotte\\'s wealthy father hosts a masquerade ball in Naveen\\'s honor. Charlotte hires Tiana to make beignets for the party and pays her enough money to buy a dilapidated mill to convert into her restaurant. Naveen and his valet, Lawrence, encounter Dr. Facilier, an evil voodoo witch doctor who plans to rule New Orleans. Facilier transforms Naveen into a frog and Lawrence into a doppelganger of Naveen, using a voodoo talisman containing Naveen\\'s blood. Facilier intends for the disguised Lawrence to marry Charlotte, then to kill her father with a voodoo doll so he can gain the La Bouff fortune.\\n At the ball, Tiana learns she has been outbid for the mill and accidentally spills food on her outfit, so Charlotte lends her a princess costume. Feeling disheartened, she begins wishing on a star when Naveen appears in frog form. Assuming Tiana is a princess, he asks her to kiss him, believing her kiss will break the spell. Tiana reluctantly agrees, but Naveen remains a frog, and Tiana is transformed into a frog herself. The two are chased into a nearby bayou, where they meet a jazz-loving alligator named Louis. When they explain their predicament, he tells them about Mama Odie, another voodoo practitioner who lives in the bayou. Naveen convinces Louis to take him and Tiana to see Mama Odie and ask her how the spell can be broken.\\n Since Louis does not know how to travel to Mama Odie, a Cajun firefly named Ray helps the trio. During the journey, Tiana and Naveen begin developing romantic feelings for each other, especially after Naveen learns to be more responsible. Meanwhile, the talisman containing Naveen\\'s blood runs out. Facilier asks his \"friends on the other side\" (a legion of voodoo spirits) to help retrieve Naveen, offering them the souls of the city\\'s population once he succeeds in taking over, and they grant him an army of shadow demons to do his bidding. The demons discover Tiana and her group in the bayou; Mama Odie rescues the group.\\n Mama Odie discovers the spell can only be broken if a princess kisses Naveen. Tiana realizes that since Charlotte\\'s father has been crowned Mardi Gras king, Charlotte will be a princess until midnight. The group hitches a ride on a steamboat back to New Orleans, during which Naveen tells Ray about his love for Tiana and plans to propose marriage to her. After talking to Tiana, Naveen selflessly decides against proposing, since transforming him and Tiana into humans and financing Tiana\\'s restaurant is contingent on him kissing and marrying Charlotte. The shadow demons capture Naveen and bring him to Facilier to replenish the talisman with Naveen\\'s blood. After Ray tells Tiana of Naveen\\'s love for her, Tiana heads to the Mardi Gras parade to find Naveen, only to see the disguised Lawrence marrying Charlotte.\\n Ray rescues the real Naveen, steals the talisman, and gives it to Tiana, just before Facilier swats him to the ground and crushes him beneath his foot, mortally wounding him. Facilier offers to make Tiana\\'s dream come true in exchange for the talisman. Realizing that she would be dishonoring her father by accepting, Tiana destroys the talisman. With Facilier\\'s plan foiled, the voodoo spirits drag him into their world for failing to pay back his debt. After Lawrence is arrested, Tiana reveals her love to Naveen. Charlotte is moved by this and agrees to kiss Naveen so he and Tiana can be human together, but as the clock strikes midnight, Charlotte is no longer a princess, so Tiana and Naveen remain frogs. Ray dies, but during the funeral Tiana and Naveen arrange for him, he is reincarnated as a star. Tiana and Naveen are married by Mama Odie, making Tiana a princess, restoring both to human form. They later return to New Orleans to legally marry and open Tiana\\'s restaurant.\\n The film\\'s composer Randy Newman makes a brief cameo as Ray\\'s \"Cousin Randy\"; the character is also designed to resemble Newman physically.\\n Disney had once announced that 2004\\'s Home on the Range would be their last traditionally animated film. After the company\\'s acquisition of Pixar in 2006, Ed Catmull and John Lasseter, the new president and chief creative officer of Disney Animation Studios, reversed this decision and reinstated hand-drawn animation at the studio.[13][14] Many animators who had either been laid off or had left the studio when the traditional animation units were dissolved in 2003 were located and re-hired for the project.[15] Lasseter also brought back directors Ron Clements and John Musker, whose earlier works include The Great Mouse Detective (1986), The Little Mermaid (1989), Aladdin (1992), Hercules (1997), and Treasure Planet (2002).[16][17] The duo had left the company in 2005, but Lasseter requested their return to Disney to direct and write the film and had let them choose the style of animation (traditional or CGI) they wanted to use.[9]\\n The film\\'s story began development by merging two projects in development at Disney and Pixar at the time, both based around \"The Frog Prince\" fairy tale.[9][15] One of the projects was based on E. D. Baker\\'s The Frog Princess, in which the story\\'s heroine (Princess Emma) kisses a prince turned frog (Prince Eadric), only to become a frog herself.[15] The other was based on Ralph Eggleston\\'s pitch of The Frog Prince set in gangster-era Chicago.[18] Jorgen Klubien separately claimed that a story he was developing at Pixar tentatively titled The Spirit of New Orleans served as inspiration for the film.[19] The Princess and the Frog returns to the musical film format used in many of the previously successful Disney animated films, with a style Musker and Clements declared, like with Aladdin and The Little Mermaid, had inspiration from Golden Age Disney features such as Cinderella (1950).[20]\\n Musker and Clements thought that given so many fairy tales were set in Europe, they could do an American fairy tale.[20] They stated that they chose New Orleans as a tribute to the history of the city, for its \"magical\" qualities, and because it was Lasseter\\'s favorite city.[9][21] The directors spent ten days in Louisiana before starting to write the film.[20]\\n The Princess and the Frog was originally announced as The Frog Princess in July 2006,[13] and early concepts and songs were presented to the public at Anchor Bay Entertainment\\'s annual shareholders\\' meeting in March 2007.[22] These announcements drew criticism from African-American media outlets, due to elements of the Frog Princess story, characters, and settings considered distasteful.[23][24] African-American critics disapproved of the original name for the heroine, \"Maddy\", due to its similarity to the derogatory word term \"mammy\".[23] Also protested were Maddy\\'s original career as a chambermaid,[24] the choice to have the Black heroine\\'s love interest be a non-Black prince,[23] and the use of a Black male voodoo witchdoctor as the film\\'s villain.[23] The Frog Princess title was also thought by critics to be a slur on French people.[25] Also questioned was the film\\'s setting of New Orleans, which had been heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, resulting in the expulsion of a large number of mostly Black residents.[26] Critics claimed the choice of New Orleans as the setting for a Disney film with a Black heroine was an affront to the Katrina victims\\' plight.[23][26]\\n In response to these early criticisms, the film\\'s title was changed in May 2007 from The Frog Princess to The Princess and the Frog. The name \"Maddy\" was changed to \"Tiana\",[25][27] and the character\\'s occupation was altered from chambermaid to waitress.[23] Talk show host Oprah Winfrey was hired as a technical consultant for the film, leading to her taking a voice-acting role in the film as Tiana\\'s mother, Eudora.[9]\\n The head of story, Don Hall, described the plot as a fairy tale \"twisted enough that it seems new and fresh\", with a kingdom that is a modern city, a handsome prince that is a \"knuckleheaded playboy\" and a variation on the fairy godmother with Mama Odie. Co-writer Rob Edwards also said The Princess and the Frog was \"a princess movie for people who don\\'t like princess movies\". As the writers thought Tiana\\'s character motivation of simply dreaming of having her own restaurant was not appealing enough, they expanded so it was her father\\'s as well, with the extra philosophy of \"food bringing people together from all walks of life\". Musker and Clements stated that while Tiana already starts as a sympathetic character, the events of the plot make her \"understand things in a deeper level\" and change people around her. Both protagonists would learn from each other—Naveen to take responsibilities, Tiana to enjoy life—as well as figuring from Ray\\'s passion for Evangeline that the perfect balance is brought by having someone you love to share the experience.[20] Tiana became the first African-American Disney Princess.[28][29]\\n Tiana was inspired in part by famed restaurateur Leah Chase, whom Clements and Musker met on their research trip to New Orleans.[30] Clements elaborated, \"There\\'s a woman in New Orleans named Lee (sic) Chase who was a waitress and ultimately opened a restaurant with her husband … we met with her and we talked with her and she went to kind of into her story, her philosophy about food, which is a big element of the movie.\"[31]\\n On December 1, 2006, a detailed casting call was announced for the film at the Manhattan Theatre Source forum.[32] The casting call states the film as being an American fairy tale musical set in New Orleans during the 1926 Jazz Age and provides a detailed list of the film\\'s major characters.[14]\\n In February 2007, it was reported that Dreamgirls actresses Jennifer Hudson and Anika Noni Rose were top contenders for the voice of Tiana and that Alicia Keys directly contacted then-Walt Disney Studios chairman Dick Cook about voicing the role.[33] It was later reported that Tyra Banks was being considered for the role.[34] By April 2007, it was confirmed that Rose would be voicing Tiana.[35] Three months later, it was reported that Keith David was cast as Doctor Facilier, the villain of the film.[36]\\n Clements and Musker had agreed early on that the style they were aiming for was primarily that of Lady and the Tramp (1955), a film which they and John Lasseter feel represents \"the pinnacle of Disney\\'s style\".[37] \"After that, everything started becoming more stylized, like Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians—which are fantastic films as well, but there\\'s a particular style (to Lady and the Tramp) that\\'s so classically Disney.\"[38] Lady and the Tramp also heavily informed the style of the New Orleans scenes, while Disney\\'s Bambi (1942) served as the template for the bayou scenes.[37] Bambi was described as a stylistic reference for the painted backgrounds, as according to art director Ian Gooding \"Bambi painted what it feels like to be in the forest instead of the forest\" so The Princess and the Frog would in turn try capturing the essence of roaming through New Orleans.[20]\\n The former trend in Disney\\'s hand-drawn features where the characters and cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look had been abandoned. Andreas Deja, a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says \"I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves to go back to what 2D is good at, which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments. You have to create a world but [we\\'re doing it more simply]. What we\\'re trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the old guys did earlier. It\\'s not going to be graphic...\".[39] Deja also mentioned that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: \"All those things that were non-graphic, which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other—an organic feel to the drawing.\"[39] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability.[40] For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: \"It\\'s the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that.\"[40] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for stylized designs \"removing all that is unappealing in frogs\", similar to Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio (1940).[20]\\n Toon Boom Animation\\'s Toon Boom Harmony computer software was used as the main software package for the production of the film, as the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) system that Disney developed with Pixar in the 1980s for use on their previous traditionally animated films had become now outdated by 2004.[41] The Harmony software was augmented with a number of plug-ins to provide CAPS-like effects such as shading on cheeks and smoke effects.[10][39] The reinstated traditional unit\\'s first production, a 2007 Goofy cartoon short entitled How to Hook Up Your Home Theater, was partly animated without paper by using Harmony and Wacom Cintiq pressure-sensitive tablets. The character animators found some difficulty with this approach, and decided to use traditional paper and pencil drawings, which were then scanned into the computer systems, for The Princess and the Frog.[10]\\n The one exception to the new Toon Boom Harmony pipeline was the \"Almost There\" dream sequence, which utilized an Art Deco graphic style based on the art of Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas.[42] Supervised by Eric Goldberg and designed by Sue Nichols,[43] the \"Almost There\" sequence\\'s character animation was done on paper without going through the clean-up animation department,[9] and scanned directly into Photoshop. The artwork was then enhanced to effect the appearance of painted strokes and fills, and combined with backgrounds, using Adobe After Effects.[7][10]\\n The visual effects and backgrounds for the film were created digitally using Cintiq tablet displays.[10][44] Marlon West, one of Disney\\'s veteran animation visual effects supervisors, says about the production; \"Those guys had this bright idea to bring back hand-drawn animation, but everything had to be started again from the ground up. One of the first things we did was focus on producing shorts, to help us re-introduce the 2D pipeline. I worked as vfx supervisor on the Goofy short, How to Hook Up Your Home Theater. It was a real plus for the effects department, so we went paperless for The Princess and the Frog.\" The backgrounds were painted digitally using Adobe Photoshop, and many of the architectural elements were based upon 3D models built in Autodesk Maya.[10] Much of the clean-up animation, digital ink-and-paint, and compositing were outsourced to third-party companies in Orlando, Florida (Premise Entertainment), Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Yowza! Animation), and Brooklin, São Paulo, Brazil (HGN Produções).[6]\\n In February 2006, Alan Menken was initially reported to be composing the soundtrack.[45] However, Lasseter thought that since Menken was scoring the Disney film Enchanted (2007) at the time, the music might be too repetitive. Lasseter felt that Randy Newman, whom he had previously worked with, was the perfect choice for the film and replaced Menken with him, due to the fact that Newman was a jazz composer and grew up in New Orleans, making him compatible with the project\\'s musical setting, not to mention that he had previous experience in adding Broadway musical style to another 2D animated film which was Cats Don\\'t Dance.[46] In February 2007, Newman was announced as the film\\'s new composer.[47]\\n During Disney\\'s 2007 shareholder meeting, Newman and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band performed the film\\'s opening number, \"Down in New Orleans\", with famous New Orleans singer Dr.\\xa0John singing, while slides of pre-production art from the film played on a screen.[22] Other songs in the film include \"Almost There\" (a solo for Tiana), \"Dig a Little Deeper\" (a song for Mama Odie), \"When We\\'re Human\" (a song for Louis, Tiana and Naveen [as frogs]), \"Friends on the Other Side\" (a solo for Doctor Facilier), and \"Gonna Take You There\" and \"Ma Belle Evangeline\" (two solos for Ray).[22] Newman composed, arranged, and conducted the music for the film, a mixture of jazz, zydeco, blues, and gospel styles performed by the voice cast members for the respective characters, while R&B singer-songwriter Ne-Yo wrote and performed the end title song, \"Never Knew I Needed\", an R&B love song referring to the romance between the film\\'s two main characters, Tiana and Naveen. Supported by a music video by Melina, \"Never Knew I Needed\" was issued to radio outlets as a commercial single from the Princess and the Frog soundtrack.[48]\\n The film\\'s soundtrack album, The Princess and the Frog: Original Songs and Score, contains the ten original songs from the film and seven instrumental pieces. The soundtrack was released on November 23, 2009, the day before the limited release of the film in New York and Los Angeles.[49]\\n The film premiered in theaters with a limited run in New York and Los Angeles beginning on November 25, 2009, followed by wide release on December 11, 2009.[50] The film was originally set for release on Christmas Day 2009, but its release date was changed due to a competing family film, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, scheduled for release the same day.[51] The Princess and the Frog received a limited re-release in AMC Theatres, lasting for one week from October 6 to October 12, 2017, as part of the Dream Big, Princess campaign.[52][53] As part of Disney\\'s 100th anniversary the film was re-released in cinemas across the UK on October 6, 2023 for one week.[54]\\n The Princess and the Frog was supported by a wide array of merchandise leading up to and following the film\\'s release. Although Disney\\'s main marketing push was not set to begin until November 2009, positive word-of-mouth promotion created demand for merchandise well in advance of the film.[55] Princess Tiana costumes were selling out prior to Halloween 2009, and a gift set of Tiana-themed hair-care products from Carol\\'s Daughter sold out in seven hours on the company\\'s website.[55] Other planned merchandise includes a cookbook for children and even a wedding gown.[55] Princess Tiana was also featured a few months before the release in the Disney on Ice: Let\\'s Celebrate! show.[56] The film itself was promoted through advertisements, including one from GEICO where Naveen, as a frog, converses with the company\\'s gecko mascot.[57]\\n A live parade and show called Tiana\\'s Showboat Jubilee! premiered on October 25, 2009, at the Magic Kingdom theme park at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida[58] and on November 5 at Disneyland in California.[59] In Disneyland, actors in New Orleans Square paraded to the Rivers of America and boarded the park\\'s steamboat.[59] From there, the cast, starring Princess Tiana, Prince Naveen, Louis the alligator, and Doctor Facilier, would sing songs from the movie, following a short story line taking place after the events of the film. The Disneyland version\\'s actors actually partook in singing, while the Walt Disney World rendition incorporated lip-syncing.[59]\\n Tiana\\'s Showboat Jubilee! ran at both parks until January 3, 2010.[58][59] At Disneyland Park, the show was replaced by a land-based event called Princess Tiana\\'s Mardi Gras Celebration, which features Princess Tiana along with five of the original presentation\\'s \"Mardi Gras dancers\" and the park\\'s \"Jambalaya Jazz Band\" as they perform songs from the movie.[60] \"Tiana\\'s Mardi Gras Celebration\" officially ended on October 3, 2010. However, it returned to Disneyland from 2011–2013 as part of the \"Limited Time Magic\" family-fun weekends.[61][62][63]\\n Tiana also appears in Disneyland Paris\\'s New Generation Festival.[64] Some of the characters appear frequently during World of Color, the nightly fountain and projection show presented at Disney California Adventure. \\n The Princess and the Frog was released in North America on DVD and Blu-ray on March 16, 2010.[65]\\n The film is available on DVD, Blu-ray, and Blu-ray combo pack editions. The combo pack includes the DVD, Digital Copy, and Blu-ray of the film.[65] The DVD edition has sold over 4.5 million copies and has made $71.8 million in DVD sales,[66] making it the ninth-best-selling DVD of 2010.[67] As of 2019, the film had earned $117 million from its domestic home media releases.[68] The Princess and the Frog was released on 4K Blu-ray on November 5, 2019.[69]\\n The movie was made available to stream on Disney+.[70]\\n On its limited day release, the film grossed $263,890 at two theaters and grossed $786,190 its opening weekend.[71][72] On its opening day in wide release, the film grossed $7 million at 3,434 theaters.[73] It went on to gross $24.2 million over the opening weekend averaging $7,050 per theater,[74] ranking at #1 for the weekend, and making it the highest-grossing opening to date for an animated movie in December (a record previously held by Beavis and Butt-Head Do America from 1996).[75] The film went on to gross $104.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $271 million worldwide. It was the fifth-highest-grossing animated film of 2009, which was deemed an underachievement by Disney\\'s standards. Overall, the film was considered a qualified commercial success against greater production and pre-release hopes.[1]\\n While the film outgrossed Disney\\'s contemporaneous hand-drawn films of the 2000s – including The Emperor\\'s New Groove (2000), Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001), Treasure Planet (2002), Brother Bear (2003), and Home on the Range (2004) – it had a considerably less auspicious time than the animated films from Disney\\'s second heyday of the latter 1980s and 1990s. Disney animator Tom Sito compared the film\\'s performance to that of The Great Mouse Detective (1986), which had been a step up from the theatrical run of the 1985 box office failure The Black Cauldron (both films presaged upcoming commercial returns to form for Disney, with The Great Mouse Detective, in particular, cited as a self-successful inflection point towards the Renaissance, including by Disney internally).[76] It has been opined that part of the film\\'s modest return could be ascribed to being overshadowed by the release of James Cameron’s Avatar a week after its release.[77] The film\\'s fiscal shortcoming was a major reason for the changing of title of the next year\\'s Tangled from \"Rapunzel\" in order to dissociate from The Princess and the Frog and the entire vacillating Disney Princess concept (Tangled would almost double its predecessor\\'s box office take).[78]\\n Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported the film has an 85% approval rating based on 201 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site\\'s general consensus is that \"The warmth of traditional Disney animation makes this occasionally lightweight fairy-tale update a lively and captivating confection for the holidays.\"[79] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[80] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[81]\\n Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \"A\" grade and applauded the film\\'s creative team for \"uphold[ing] the great tradition of classic Disney animation\".[82] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised Walt Disney Animation for \"rediscovering its traditional hand-drawn animation\" and for \"a thing called story\".[83] David Germain of the Associated Press wrote that \"The Princess and the Frog is not the second coming of Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King. It\\'s just plain pleasant, an old-fashioned little charmer that\\'s not straining to be the next glib animated compendium of pop-culture flotsam.\"[84]\\n Justin Chang of Variety was less receptive, stating \"this long-anticipated throwback to a venerable house style never comes within kissing distance of the studio\\'s former glory\".[85] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film three stars out of five stars while saying \"The Princess and the Frog breaks the color barrier for Disney princesses, but is a throwback to traditional animation and her story is a retread\".[86] Village Voice\\'s Scott Foundas found that \"the movie as a whole never approaches the wit, cleverness, and storytelling brio of the studio\\'s early-1990s animation renaissance (Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King) or pretty much anything by Pixar\".[87] Betsy Sharkey, formerly of the Los Angeles Times, gave the film a positive review claiming: \"With The Princess and the Frog they\\'ve gotten just about everything right. The dialogue is fresh-prince clever, the themes are ageless, the rhythms are riotous and the return to a primal animation style is beautifully executed.\"[88]\\n Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and admired Disney\\'s step back to traditional animation, writing, \"No 3-D! No glasses! No extra ticket charge! No frantic frenzies of meaningless action! And\\xa0... good gravy! A story! Characters! A plot! This is what classic animation once was like!\", but stated that the film \"inspires memories of Disney\\'s Golden Age it doesn\\'t quite live up to, as I\\'ve said, but it\\'s spritely and high-spirited, and will allow kids to enjoy it without visually assaulting them.\"[89] S. Jhoanna Robledo of Common Sense Media gave the film three out of five stars, writing, \"First African-American Disney princess is a good role model\".[90] Saint Bryan of KING 5 Seattle praised the film and called it \"The Best Disney Movie Since The Lion King\".[91]\\n Upon its release, the film created controversy among some Christians over its use of Louisiana Voodoo as a plot device.[92] Christianity Today\\'s review of the film cited its sexual undertones and use of voodoo, arguing that the scenes with Dr.\\xa0Facilier and his \"friends on the other side\" contain many horror elements and that young children might be frightened by the film.[93] The film\\'s negative portrayal of Voodoo also drew criticism from non-Christian factions.[94] The film also received criticism for historical negationism of the Jim Crow era in the Southern USA.[95][96][97]\\n The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and twice for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, but lost to Up and Crazy Heart, respectively.[4][98] It was also nominated for eight Annie Awards and at the 37th Annie Awards Ceremony on February 6, 2010, won three.[8]\\n Following The Princess and the Frog, Disney considered releasing at least one hand-drawn animated film every two years,[110] starting with Winnie the Pooh (2011), and continuing with a film inspired by \"The Snow Queen\". The medium of the latter was later switched to CGI (although it features a similar visual style to the 2010 film Tangled by blending elements of the two media) due to complex visual elements in the story. The film was ultimately titled Frozen, and was released in 2013.\\n The blog website /Film noted in July 2014 with the release of hand-drawn concept art for Frozen (which grossed over US$1 billion worldwide), that any future hand-drawn animated films have been \"killed\" for the time being due to The Princess and the Frog failing \"to ignite the box office\".[111] Two months later, however, many Disney artists announced they were working on a new independent hand-drawn animated film, Hullabaloo, as part of an attempt to bring back hand-drawn animation,[112] consisting in three short films, while others got later involved on making the Netflix animated film Klaus, released in 2019.\\n Looking back on the experience four years later, Catmull stated that Disney had made a \"serious mistake\" in the process of marketing and releasing the film.[113] Walt Disney Studios\\' marketing department had warned Disney Animation that the word \"princess\" in the title \"would lead moviegoers to think that the film was for girls only,\" but the animation studio\\'s management insisted on keeping the \"princess\" title because they believed that the film\\'s quality and hand-drawn animation would bring in all quadrants anyway.[113] In Catmull\\'s words, this belief \"was our own version of a stupid pill.\"[113] The marketing department turned out to be correct in their prediction that many moviegoers would and did avoid the film because they thought it was \"for little girls only.\"[113] This was further compounded by the fact that the film opened a week before Avatar.[113]\\n Looking back on the experience seven years later, Lasseter told Variety: \"I was determined to bring back [hand-drawn animation] because I felt it was such a heritage of the Disney studio, and I love the art form … I was stunned that Princess didn\\'t do better. We dug into it and did a lot of research and focus groups. It was viewed as old-fashioned by the audience.\"[114]\\n Despite the absence of traditional animated feature films after the release of Winnie the Pooh, Disney Animation has been using both media for the sake of experimenting with new techniques and styles. In 2019, after Lasseter left Disney, Jennifer Lee (the succeeding CCO of Walt Disney Animation Studios), producer Peter Del Vecho and director Chris Buck confirmed that making another 2D animated film is still possible, and that the different styles are driven by the filmmakers who chose what method to use to tell their stories.[115]\\n Since the film\\'s original release, it has had success on streaming platforms and with merchandise sales.[116][117]\\n \\nA manga adaptation of the film was released to tie in to the film\\'s Japanese release.[118][119][120][121][122] Tiana, Naveen, and Dr. Facilier appear as meet-and-greet characters on Main Street, U.S.A, Liberty Square and in Frontierland at the Disney Parks, while Louis appears during parades or live shows.[123]\\n In June 2020, Disney announced that the Splash Mountain theme park attraction, which is themed to Disney\\'s 1946 film Song of the South, would be rethemed based on The Princess and the Frog in Disneyland and Magic Kingdom, which was stated to have had been in development since 2019. The announcement came amid the ongoing George Floyd protests and online petitions to change the theme of Splash Mountain.[124][125] The New York Times reported that Disney executives had privately discussed removing the attraction\\'s Song of the South theme for at least five years, before putting into development the Princess and the Frog theme.[126]\\n The attraction\\'s story line takes place after the events of the film, with Tiana hosting a party for the people of New Orleans during Carnival season. Tiana discovers that due to a mix-up, the celebration is missing a band and needs the guests\\' help to find one, as they join her and Louis on a trip to the bayou to search for critter musicians.[127][128][129] In June 2022, Anika Noni Rose mentioned during an interview on Live with Kelly and Ryan that she has been involved with discussions with Disney on what they want the attraction to be like.[130] In July 2022 during the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, Disney announced that the attraction would be called Tiana\\'s Bayou Adventure, setting an opening date of \"late 2024\" at both parks.[131][132] At the D23 Expo in September 2022, it was confirmed that Rose, Bruno Campos, Michael-Leon Wooley, and Jenifer Lewis would be reprising their roles for the ride.[133] The Magic Kingdom version of Splash Mountain closed in January 2023,[134] while the Disneyland version closed in May 2023.[135] Tiana\\'s Bayou Adventure opened at Magic Kingdom on June 28, 2024 and on November 15, 2024 at Disneyland.[136][137][138]\\n In December 2020, Disney announced a television spin-off titled Tiana is in development for Disney+.[139] It was also announced that Anika Noni Rose, who voiced Tiana in the film would be reprising her role in the series.[140] On November 12, 2021, Stella Meghie was announced as writer and director, making her the first African-American director to helm a Walt Disney Animation Studios project,[141] but was replaced in those capacities by Joyce Sherri by October 2023.[142] Then-Walt Disney Animation Studios chief creative officer Jennifer Lee contacted Meghie for the project following the latter\\'s attempt to pitch a live-action remake of The Princess and the Frog.[143] The series will center on Tiana as she explores her city of New Orleans.[144]\\n A first look of Tiana was revealed in 2021,[141] with the series originally scheduled to release in 2022.[145][146] The release date was later changed to 2023[147] and eventually 2024.[148] In March 2023, the show\\'s page changed to \"coming soon to Disney+\" with mention of a date removed.[149]\\n The series will be among the first spin-offs of a Walt Disney Animation Studios film to be produced by the studio itself rather than Disney Television Animation. Animation services will be provided by Walt Disney Animation Studios\\' Burbank and Vancouver studios, with storyboarding and pre-production also handled at the Burbank studio.[150]\\n In January 2022, Jennifer Lee revealed that Stella Meghie, originally the writer and director of Tiana, wanted to develop a live-action adaptation of the film.[151]', 'Frozen may refer to:', 'Moana (which means Ocean in some Polynesian languages) may refer to:', '\"Snow-White and Rose-Red\" (German: Schneeweißchen und Rosenrot) is a German fairy tale. The best-known version is the one collected by the Brothers Grimm in 1837 in the third edition of their collection Grimm\\'s Fairy Tales (KHM 161).[1] It was first published by Wilhelm Grimm in 1827 in Wilhelm Hauff\\'s Märchen-Almanach.[2] An older, somewhat shorter version, \"The Ungrateful Dwarf\", was written by Caroline Stahl (1776–1837). Indeed, that appears to be the oldest variant; no previous oral version is known, although several have been collected since its publication in 1818.[3] Oral versions are very limited regionally.[4] The tale is of Aarne-Thompson type 426 (\"The Two Girls, the Bear, and the Dwarf\").[1]\\n Despite the presence of one dwarf, this story is not related to the Brothers Grimm fairy tale \"Snow White\" that provided the basis for the 1937 Walt Disney animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The modern German name of that heroine is Schneewittchen rather than Schneeweißchen. This story has little in common but the similar name of its fair-skinned girl.\\n Snow-White and Rose-Red are two little girls living with their mother, a poor widow, in a small cottage by the woods. Snow-White is quiet and shy and prefers to spend her time indoors, doing housework and reading. Rose-Red is outspoken, lively and cheerful, and prefers to be outside. They are both very good girls who love each other and their mother dearly, and their mother is very fond of them as well.\\n One winter night, there is a knock at the door. Rose-Red opens the door to find a bear. At first, she is terrified, but the bear tells her not to be afraid. \"I\\'m half frozen and I merely want to warm up a little at your place,\" he says. They let the bear in, and he lies down in front of the fire. Snow-White and Rose-Red beat the snow off the bear, and they quickly become quite friendly with him. They play with the bear and roll him around playfully. They let the bear spend the night in front of the fire. In the morning, he leaves trotting out into the woods. The bear comes back every night for the rest of that winter and the family grows used to him.\\n When summer comes, the bear tells them that he must go away for a while to guard his treasure from a wicked dwarf. During the summer, when the girls are walking through the forest, they find a dwarf whose beard is stuck in a tree. The girls rescue him by cutting his beard free, but the dwarf is ungrateful and yells at them for cutting his beautiful beard. The girls encounter the dwarf several times that summer and rescue him from some peril each time, for which he is ungrateful.\\n Then one day, they meet the dwarf once again. This time, he is terrified because the bear is about to kill him. The dwarf pleads with the bear and begs it to eat the girls. Instead, the bear pays no heed to his plea and kills the dwarf with one swipe of his paw. Instantly, the bear turns into a prince. The dwarf had previously put a spell on the prince by stealing his precious stones and turning him into a bear. The curse is broken with the death of the dwarf. Snow-White marries the prince and Rose-Red marries the prince\\'s brother.\\n The tale is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as tale type ATU 426, \"The Two Girls, the Bear, and the Dwarf\": a pair of sisters welcome a bear into their house; the next summer, the girls rescue an ungrateful dwarf three times; at the end of the tale, the bear defeats the dwarf (who cursed him in the first place) and becomes a human prince.[5][6][7]\\n According to scholars Johannes Bolte, Jiri Polívka, Stith Thompson, and Hans-Jörg Uther, the tale, in the Grimm\\'s compilation, originated from a story written by author Karoline Stahl and published in 1818.[8][9][7]\\n In an early analysis, German scholar Kurt Ranke noted that the existing variants originated from \"Central Europe\": Flanders, France, Germany and Switzerland.[10]\\n German folklorist Hans-Jörg Uther, in the Folktale Catalogue of the German-speaking Area, classifies the tale as type ATU 426, Schneeweißchen und Rosenrot (\"Snow-White and Rose-Red\"), which is sparsely attested in Germanophone areas.[11][12] In addition, Kurt Ranke argued that the Grimm\\'s tale influenced variants collected later, such as Wittrösken und Rautrösken.[13]\\n According to Frisian scholar Jurjen van der Kooi, in the Catalogue of Frisian Folktales, the tale type is also attested in Friesland, but the heroines are named Blauwoogje (\"Blue-Eyes\") and Bruin-oogje (\"Brown-Eyes\").[14] In addition, Dutch scholar Theo Meder published a Dutch tale titled Rozerood en Lelieblank (\"Rose-Red and Lily-White\"), from a storyteller from Driebergen, Utrecht, who sent it in 1892 to linguist Gerrit Jacob Boekenoogen\\xa0[nl].[15][16]\\n Johannes Bolte and Jiří Polívka cited a tale titled Rozenroodje, collected by J. F. Vincx from Hageland (Flanders).[8]\\n The tale type is also attested in the East Slavic Folktale Classification (Russian: СУС, romanized:\\xa0SUS), indexed as type SUS 426, \"Две девушки, медведь (волк) и карлик\" (\"Two Girls, the Bear/Wolf and the Dwarf\"), but only in Russia and Ukraine.[17]\\n Philologist and folklorist Julian Krzyżanowski, establisher of the Polish Folktale Catalogue according to the international index, located a single Polish variant of type 426, Narzeczony niedźwiedź (\"The Bear Groom\"). However, Krzyżanowski indicated that the tale was a literary reworking that excised the dwarf and introduced other characters.[18]\\n According to the Latvian Folktale Catalogue, a similar story is found in Latvia, indexed as tale type 426, Lācis — princis (\"Bear Prince\"): two girls shelter a bear and rescue a dwarf; the bear defeats the dwarf and regains human form.[19]\\n French scholars Paul Delarue and Marie-Louise Thèneze, establishers of the French folktale catalogue, reported only two variants in France of tale type ATU 426, Les deux fillettes, l\\'ours et le nain (\"The Two Little Girls, the Bear and the Dwarf\"), which they considered to be retellings of the Grimm\\'s story.[20]\\n RashDash.\\xa0 ‘Snow White & Rose Red.’ https://www.rashdash.co.uk/snowwhiterosered\\n Willingham, Bill.\\xa0 Fables. Vertigo (DC Comics). American comic book series.', '\"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\" (Arabic: علي بابا والأربعون لصا) is a folk tale in Arabic added to the One Thousand and One Nights in the 18th century by its French translator Antoine Galland, who heard it from Syrian storyteller Hanna Diyab. As one of the most popular Arabian Nights tales, it has been widely retold and performed in many media across the world, especially for children (for whom the more violent aspects of the story are often removed).\\n In the original version, Ali Baba (Arabic: علي بابا ʿAlī Bābā) is a poor woodcutter and an honest person who discovers the secret treasure of a thieves\\' den, and enters with the magic phrase \"open sesame\". The thieves try to kill Ali Baba, and his rich and greedy brother Cassim tries to steal the treasure for himself, but Ali Baba’s faithful slave-girl foils their plots. His son marries her, and Ali Baba keeps the secret of the treasure.\\n The tale was added to the story collection One Thousand and One Nights by one of its European translators, Antoine Galland, who called his volumes Les Mille et Une Nuits (1704–1717). Galland was an 18th-century French Orientalist who heard it in oral form from a Syrian Maronite story-teller called Hanna Diyab, who came from Aleppo in modern-day Syria and told the story in Paris.[1] In any case, the earliest known text of the story is Galland\\'s French version. Richard F. Burton included it in the supplemental volumes (rather than the main collection of stories) of his translation (published as The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night).[2]\\n The American Orientalist Duncan Black MacDonald discovered an Arabic-language manuscript of the story at the Bodleian Library;[3] however, this was later found to be a counterfeit.[4]\\n Ali Baba and his older brother, Cassim (Arabic: قاسم Qāsim, sometimes spelled Kasim), are the sons of a merchant. After their father\\'s death, the greedy Cassim marries a wealthy woman and becomes well-to-do, living lazily on their father\\'s business and his wife’s wealth. Ali Baba marries a poor woman and settles into the trade of a woodcutter. Cassim and his wife resent Ali Baba and his side of the family and do not share their wealth with them.\\n One day, Ali Baba is at work collecting and cutting firewood in the forest, when he happens to overhear a group of 40 thieves visiting their stored treasure. Their treasure is in a cave, the mouth of which is sealed by a huge rock. It opens on the magic words \"open sesame\" and seals itself on the words \"close sesame\". When the thieves are gone, Ali Baba enters the cave himself and although there is a vast amount of riches stashed inside, he modestly takes only a single bag of gold coins home.\\n Ali Baba and his wife borrow his sister-in-law\\'s scales to weigh their new wealth. Unbeknownst to them, Cassim\\'s wife puts a blob of wax in the scales to find out what Ali Baba is using them for, as she is curious to know what kind of grain her impoverished brother-in-law needs to measure. \\n To her shock, she finds a gold coin sticking to the scales and tells her husband. Under pressure from his brother, Ali Baba is forced to reveal the secret of the cave. Cassim goes to the cave, taking a donkey with him to take as much treasure as possible. He enters the cave with the magic words. However, in his excited greed over the treasure, he forgets the words to get out again and ends up trapped. The thieves find him there and kill him. When his brother does not come back, Ali Baba goes to the cave to look for him, and finds the body quartered and with each piece displayed just inside the cave\\'s entrance, as a warning to anyone else who might try to enter.\\n Ali Baba brings the corpse home where he entrusts Morgiana (Arabic: مرجانة Murjāna), a clever slave-girl from Cassim\\'s household, with the task of making others believe that Cassim has died a natural death. First, Morgiana purchases medicines from an apothecary, telling him that Cassim is gravely ill. Then, she finds an old tailor known as Baba Mustafa whom she pays, blindfolds, and leads to Cassim\\'s house. There, overnight, the tailor stitches the pieces of Cassim\\'s body back together. Ali Baba and his family are able to give Cassim a proper burial without anyone suspecting anything. Cassim’s wife does not find out about the cave or treasure.\\n The thieves, finding the body gone, realize that another person must have known their secret, so they set out to track him down. One of the thieves goes down to the town and comes across Baba Mustafa, who mentions that he has just sewn the pieces of a corpse back together. Realizing the dead man must have been the thieves\\' victim, the thief asks Baba Mustafa to lead the way to the house where the deed was performed. The tailor is blindfolded again, and in this state he is able to retrace his steps and find the house. \\n The thief marks the door with a symbol so the other thieves can come back that night and kill everyone in the house. However, the thief has been seen by Morgiana who, loyal to her master, foils the thief\\'s plan by marking all the houses in the neighborhood similarly. When the 40 thieves return that night, they cannot identify the correct house, and their leader kills the unsuccessful thief in a furious rage. The next day, another thief revisits Baba Mustafa and tries again. Only this time, a chunk is chipped out of the stone step at Ali Baba\\'s front door. Again, Morgiana foils the plan by making similar chips in all the other doorsteps, and the second thief is killed for his failure as well. At last, the leader of the thieves goes and looks himself. This time, he memorizes every detail he can of the exterior of Ali Baba\\'s house.\\n The leader of the thieves pretends to be an oil merchant in need of Ali Baba\\'s hospitality, bringing with him mules loaded with 38 oil jars, one filled with oil, the other 37 hiding the other remaining thieves. Once Ali Baba is asleep, the thieves plan to kill him. Again, Morgiana discovers and foils the plan when her lamp runs out of oil and she has to get it from the merchant\\'s jars; the thieves give themselves away one by one hearing her approach and mistaking her for their boss. After refilling her lamp, Morgiana kills the 37 thieves in their jars by pouring boiling oil on them one by one. When their leader comes to rouse his men, he discovers they are all dead and escapes. The next morning, Morgiana tells Ali Baba about the thieves in the jars. They bury them, and Ali Baba shows his gratitude by giving Morgiana her freedom. However, she continues living with Ali Baba and his family anyway.\\n To exact revenge, the leader of the thieves establishes himself as a merchant, befriends Ali Baba\\'s son (who is now in charge of his late uncle Cassim\\'s business), and is invited to dinner at Ali Baba\\'s house. However, the thief is recognized by Morgiana, who performs a sword dance with a dagger for the diners and plunges it into the thief\\'s heart, when he is off his guard. Ali Baba is at first angry with Morgiana, but when he finds out the thief wanted to kill him, he is extremely grateful and rewards Morgiana by marrying her to his son. Ali Baba is then left as the only one knowing the secret of the treasure in the cave and how to access it.\\n The story has been classified in the Aarne–Thompson-Uther classification system as ATU 954, \"The Forty Thieves\".[5] The tale type enjoys \"almost universal ... diffusion\".[6]\\n A West African version, named The Password: Outwitting Thieves has been found.[7]\\n Percy Amaury Talbot located a Nigerian variant, called The Treasure House in the Bush, from Ojong Akpan of Mfamosing.[8]\\n An American variant was collected by Elsie Clews Parsons from Cape Verde.[9]\\n Audio readings/dramatizations include:\\n •\\tAdventures of Ali Baba (2018–2019) is an Indian animated television series, produced by Shilpa Shetty Kundra, which aired on Colors Rishtey.

Merrie Melodies short directed by Chuck Jones. Released on February 9, 1957, it features Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck stumbling upon a cave filled with treasure, guarded by a ruthless character named Hassan.\\n At the United States Air Force Academy, Cadet Squadron 40 was originally nicknamed \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\" before eventually changing its name to the \"P-40 Warhawks\".[35]\\n The name \"Ali Baba\" was often used as derogatory slang by American and Iraqi soldiers and their allies in the Iraq War, to describe individuals suspected of a variety of offenses related to theft and looting.[36] Additionally, British soldiers routinely used the term to refer to Iraqi civilians.[37] In the subsequent occupation, it is used as a general term for the insurgents.[38]\\n The Iraqis adopted the term \"Ali Baba\" to describe foreign troops suspected of looting.[39]\\n Malays adopted the term \"Ali Baba\" to describe anyone wearing a fez.', 'Sinbad the Sailor (/ˈsɪnbæd/; Arabic: سندباد البحري, romanized:\\xa0Sindibādu l-Bahriyy  or Sindbad) is a fictional mariner and the hero of a story-cycle. He is described as hailing from Baghdad during the early Abbasid Caliphate (8th and 9th centuries A.D.). In the course of seven voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures in magical realms, encountering monsters and witnessing supernatural phenomena.\\n The tales of Sinbad are a relatively late addition to the One Thousand and One Nights. They do not feature in the earliest 14th-century manuscript, and they appear as an independent cycle in 18th- and 19th-century collections. The tale reflects the trend within the Abbasid realm of Arab and Muslim sailors exploring the world. The stories display the folk and themes present in works of that time. The Abbasid reign was known as a period of great economic and social growth. Arab and Muslim traders would seek new trading routes and people to trade with. This process of growth is reflected in the Sinbad tales. The Sinbad stories take on a variety of different themes. Later sources include Abbasid works such as the \"Wonders of the Created World\", reflecting the experiences of 13th century Arab mariners who braved the Indian Ocean.[1]\\n The Sinbad cycle is set in the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786–809). The Sinbad tales are included in the first European translation of the Nights, Antoine Galland\\'s Les mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en français, an English edition of which appeared in 1711 as The new Arabian winter nights entertainments[2] and went through numerous editions throughout the 18th century.\\n The earliest separate publication of the Sinbad tales in English found in the British Library is an adaptation as The Adventures of Houran Banow, etc. (Taken from the Arabian Nights, being the third and fourth voyages of Sinbad the Sailor.),[3] around 1770. An early US edition, The seven voyages of Sinbad the sailor. And The story of Aladdin; or, The wonderful lamp, was published in Philadelphia in 1794.[4] Numerous popular editions followed in the early 19th century, including a chapbook edition by Thomas Tegg. Its best known full translation was perhaps as tale 120 in Volume 6 of Sir Richard Burton\\'s 1885 translation of The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night.[5][6][7]\\n Like the 1001 Nights, the Sinbad story-cycle has a frame story which goes as follows: in the days of Harun al-Rashid, Caliph of Baghdad, a poor porter (one who carries goods for others in the market and throughout the city) pauses to rest on a bench outside the gate of a rich merchant\\'s house, where he complains to God about the injustice of a world which allows the rich to live in ease while he must toil and yet remain poor. The owner of the house hears and sends for the porter, finding that they are both named Sinbad. The rich Sinbad tells the poor Sinbad that he became wealthy \"by Fortune and Fate\" in the course of seven wondrous voyages, which he then proceeds to relate.\\n After dissipating the wealth left to him by his father, Sinbad goes to sea to repair his fortune. He sets ashore on what appears to be an island, but this island proves to be a gigantic sleeping whale on which trees have taken root ever since the whale was young. Awakened by a fire kindled by the sailors, the whale dives into the depths, the ship departs without Sinbad, and Sinbad is only saved by a passing wooden trough sent by the grace of God. He is washed ashore on a densely wooded island. While exploring the deserted island, he comes across one of the king\\'s grooms. When Sinbad helps save the king\\'s mare from being drowned by a sea horse (not a seahorse, but a supernatural horse that lives underwater), the groom brings Sinbad to the king. The king befriends Sinbad, and he rises in the king\\'s favor and becomes a trusted courtier. One day, the very ship on which Sinbad set sail docks at the island, and he reclaims his goods (still in the ship\\'s hold). Sinbad gives the king his goods and in return the king gives him rich presents. Sinbad sells these presents for a great profit. Sinbad returns to Baghdad, where he resumes a life of ease and pleasure. With the ending of the tale, Sinbad the sailor makes Sinbad the porter a gift of a hundred gold pieces and bids him return the next day to hear more about his adventures.\\n On the second day of Sinbad\\'s tale-telling (but the 549th night of Scheherazade\\'s), Sinbad the sailor tells how he grew restless of his life of leisure, and set to sea again, \"possessed with the thought of traveling about the world of men and seeing their cities and islands.\" Accidentally abandoned by his shipmates again, he finds himself stranded in an island which contains roc eggs. He attaches himself with the help of his turban to a roc and is transported to a valley of giant snakes which can swallow elephants; these serve as the rocs\\' natural prey. The floor of the valley is carpeted with diamonds, and merchants harvest these by throwing huge chunks of meat into the valley: the birds carry the meat back to their nests, and the men drive the birds away and collect the diamonds stuck to the meat. The wily Sinbad straps one of the pieces of meat to his back and is carried back to the nest along with a large sack full of precious gems. Rescued from the nest by the merchants, he returns to Baghdad with a fortune in diamonds, seeing many marvels along the way.\\n Sinbad sets sail again from Basra. But by ill chance, he and his companions are cast up on an island where they are captured by a \"huge creature in the likeness of a man, black of colour, ... with eyes like coals of fire and large canine teeth like boar\\'s tusks and a vast big gape like the mouth of a well. Moreover, he had long loose lips like camel\\'s, hanging down upon his breast, and ears like two Jarms falling over his shoulder-blades, and the nails of his hands were like the claws of a lion.\" This monster begins eating the crew, beginning with the Reis (captain), who is the fattest. (Burton notes that the giant \"is distinctly Polyphemus\".)\\n Sinbad hatches a plan to blind the beast with the two red-hot iron spits with which the monster has been kebabbing and roasting the ship\\'s company. He and the remaining men escape on a raft they constructed the day before. However, the giant\\'s mate hits most of the escaping men with rocks and they are killed. After further adventures (including a gigantic python from which Sinbad escapes using his quick wits), he returns to Baghdad, wealthier than ever.\\n Impelled by restlessness, Sinbad takes to the seas again and, as usual, is shipwrecked. The naked savages amongst whom he finds himself feed his companions a herb which robs them of their reason (Burton theorises that this might be bhang), prior to fattening them for the table. Sinbad realises what is happening and refuses to eat the madness-inducing plant. When the cannibals lose interest in him, he escapes. A party of itinerant pepper-gatherers transports him to their own island, where their king befriends him and gives him a beautiful and wealthy wife.\\n Too late Sinbad learns of a peculiar custom of the land: on the death of one marriage partner, the other is buried alive with his or her spouse, both in their finest clothes and most costly jewels. Sinbad\\'s wife falls ill and dies soon after, leaving Sinbad trapped in a cavern, a communal tomb, with a jug of water and seven pieces of bread. Just as these meagre supplies are almost exhausted, another couple—the husband dead, the wife alive—are dropped into the cavern. Sinbad bludgeons the wife to death and takes her rations.\\n Such episodes continue; soon he has a sizable store of bread and water, as well as the gold and gems from the corpses, but is still unable to escape, until one day a wild animal shows him a passage to the outside, high above the sea. From here, a passing ship rescues him and carries him back to Baghdad, where he gives alms to the poor and resumes his life of pleasure.\\n Burton\\'s footnote comments: \"This tale is evidently taken from the escape of Aristomenes the Messenian from the pit into which he had been thrown, a fox being his guide. The Arabs in an early day were eager students of Greek literature.\" Similarly, the first half of the voyage resembles the Circe episode in The Odyssey, with certain differences: while a plant robs Sinbad\\'s men of their reason in the Arab tales, it is Circe\\'s magic which \"fattened\" Odysseus\\' men in The Odyssey. It is in an earlier episode, featuring the \\'Lotus Eaters\\', that Odysseus\\' men are fed a similar magical fruit which robs them of their senses.\\n \"When I had been a while on shore after my fourth voyage; and when, in my comfort and pleasures and merry-makings and in my rejoicing over my large gains and profits, I had forgotten all I had endured of perils and sufferings, the carnal man was again seized with the longing to travel and to see foreign countries and islands.\" Soon at sea once more, while passing a desert island Sinbad\\'s crew spots a gigantic egg that Sinbad recognizes as belonging to a roc. Out of curiosity, the ship\\'s passengers disembark to view the egg. They end up breaking it and have the chick inside as a meal. Sinbad immediately recognizes the folly of their behaviour and orders all back aboard ship. However, the infuriated parent rocs soon catch up with the vessel and destroy it by dropping giant boulders they have carried in their talons.[8]\\n Shipwrecked yet again, Sinbad is enslaved by the Old Man of the Sea, who rides on his shoulders with his legs twisted round Sinbad\\'s neck and will not let go, riding him both day and night until Sinbad would welcome death. (Burton\\'s footnote discusses possible origins for the old man—the orang-utan, the Greek god Triton—and favours the African custom of riding on slaves in this way).[9]\\n Eventually, Sinbad makes wine and tricks the Old Man into drinking some. Sinbad kills him after he drunkenly falls off. A ship carries him to the City of the Apes, a place whose inhabitants spend each night in boats off-shore, while their town is abandoned to man-eating apes. Yet through the apes, Sinbad recoups his fortune and eventually finds a ship which takes him home once more to Baghdad.\\n \"My soul yearned for travel and traffic\". Sinbad is shipwrecked yet again, this time quite violently as his ship is dashed to pieces on tall cliffs. There is no food to be had anywhere, and Sinbad\\'s companions die of starvation until only he is left. He builds a raft and discovers a river running out of a cavern beneath the cliffs. The stream proves to be filled with precious stones and it becomes apparent that the island\\'s streams flow with ambergris. He falls asleep as he journeys through the darkness and awakens in the city of the king of Serendib (Sri Lanka/Ceylon), \"diamonds are in its rivers and pearls are in its valleys\". The king marvels at what Sinbad tells him of the great Haroun al-Rashid, and asks that he take a present back to Baghdad on his behalf, a cup carved from a single ruby, with other gifts including a bed made from the skin of the serpent that swallowed an elephant[a] (\"And whoso sitteth upon it never sickeneth\"), and \"A hundred thousand miskals of Sindh lign-aloesa.\", and a slave-girl \"like a shining moon\". Sinbad returns to Baghdad, where the Caliph wonders greatly at the reports Sinbad gives of Serendib.\\n The ever-restless Sinbad sets sail once more, with the usual result. Cast up on a desolate shore, he constructs a raft and floats down a nearby river to a great city. Here the chief of the merchants gives Sinbad his daughter in marriage, names him his heir, and conveniently dies. The inhabitants of this city are transformed once a month into birds, and Sinbad has one of the bird-people carry him to the uppermost reaches of the sky, where he hears the angels glorifying God, \"whereat I wondered and exclaimed, \\'Praised be God! Extolled be the perfection of God!\\'\". But no sooner are the words out than there comes fire from heaven which all but consumes the bird-men. The bird-people are angry with Sinbad and set him down on a mountain-top, where he meets two youths, servants of God who give him a golden staff; returning to the city, Sinbad learns from his wife that the bird-men are devils, although she and her father were not of their number. And so, at his wife\\'s suggestion, Sinbad sells all his possessions and returns with her to Baghdad, where at last he resolves to live quietly in the enjoyment of his wealth, and to seek no more adventures.\\n Burton includes a variant of the seventh tale, in which Haroun al-Rashid asks Sinbad to carry a return gift to the king of Serendib. Sinbad replies, \"By Allah the Omnipotent, Oh my lord, I have taken a loathing to wayfare, and when I hear the words \\'Voyage\\' or \\'Travel,\\' my limbs tremble\". He then tells the Caliph of his misfortune-filled voyages; Haroun agrees that with such a history \"thou dost only right never even to talk of travel\". Nevertheless, at the Caliph\\'s command, Sinbad sets forth on this, his uniquely diplomatic voyage. The king of Serendib is well pleased with the Caliph\\'s gifts (which include, among other things, the food tray of King Solomon) and showers Sinbad with his favour. On the return voyage, the usual catastrophe strikes: Sinbad is captured and sold into slavery. His master sets him to shooting elephants with a bow and arrow, which he does until the king of the elephants carries him off to the elephants\\' graveyard. Sinbad\\'s master is so pleased with the huge quantities of ivory in the graveyard that he sets Sinbad free, and Sinbad returns to Baghdad, rich with ivory and gold. \"Here I went in to the Caliph and, after saluting him and kissing hands, informed him of all that had befallen me; whereupon he rejoiced in my safety and thanked Almighty Allah; and he made my story be written in letters of gold. I then entered my house and met my family and brethren: and such is the end of the history that happened to me during my seven voyages. Praise be to Allah, the One, the Creator, the Maker of all things in Heaven and Earth!\".\\n Some versions return to the frame story, in which Sinbad the Porter may receive a final generous gift from Sinbad the Sailor. In other versions the story cycle ends here, and there is no further mention of Sinbad the Porter.\\n Sinbad\\'s quasi-iconic status in Western culture has led to his name being recycled for a wide range of uses in both serious and not-so-serious contexts, frequently with only a tenuous connection to the original tales. Many films, television series, animated cartoons, novels, and video games have been made, most of them featuring Sinbad not as a merchant who stumbles into adventure, but as a dashing dare-devil adventure-seeker.\\n Note: Sinbad was mentioned, but did not actually appear, in the Season 3 episode Been There, Done That of Xena Warrior Princess when one of the story\\'s lovers tells Xena that he was hoping that Hercules would have appeared to save his village from its curse.\\n Note: A pair of foreign films that had nothing to do with the Sinbad character were released in North America, with the hero being referred to as \"Sinbad\" in the dubbed soundtrack. The 1952 Russian film Sadko (based on Rimsky-Korsakov\\'s opera Sadko) was overdubbed and released in English in 1962 as The Magic Voyage of Sinbad, while the 1963 Japanese film Dai tozoku (whose main character was a heroic pirate named Sukezaemon) was overdubbed and released in English in 1965 as The Lost World of Sinbad.[citation needed]', 'Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb (Hop-on-My-Thumb), or Hop o\\' My Thumb, also known as Little Thumbling, Little Thumb, or Little Poucet (French: Le Petit Poucet), is one of the eight fairytales published by Charles Perrault in Histoires ou Contes du temps passé (1697), now world-renowned.[1][2] It is Aarne-Thompson type 327B, the small boy defeats the ogre.[3] This type of fairytale, in the French oral tradition, is often combined with motifs from the type 327A, similar to Hansel and Gretel; one such tale is The Lost Children.[4]\\n The story was first published in English as Little Poucet in Robert Samber\\'s 1729 translation of Perrault\\'s book, \"Histories, or Tales of Past Times\". In 1764, the name of the hero was changed to Little Thumb. In 1804, William Godwin, in \"Tabart\\'s Collection of Popular Stories for the Nursery\", retitled it Hop o\\' my Thumb, a term that was common in the 16th century, referring to a tiny person.[5]\\n Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb (le petit Poucet) is the youngest of seven children in a poor woodcutter\\'s family. His greater wisdom compensates for his smallness of size. When the children are abandoned by their parents, he finds a variety of means to save his life and the lives of his brothers. After being threatened and pursued by an ogre, Poucet steals his magic seven-league boots while the monster is sleeping.\\n A poor woodcutter and his wife are no longer able to support their children and intend to abandon them in a forest. Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb, overhearing his parents, plans ahead and collects small white pebbles from a river. He uses the stones to mark a trail that enables him to successfully lead his brothers back home. However, the second time round, he uses breadcrumbs instead, which the birds eat up.\\n The brothers are lost in the woods. Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb climbs up a tree and spots a distant light. The boys walk towards it. They come at last to a house, and learn that it belongs to an ogre. Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb, fearing the wolves, decides to take the risk of staying in the monster\\'s residence.\\n The ogre allows the boys to sleep for the night, and provides a bed for them in his daughters\\' room. But the ogre wakes up not too long after, and prepares to kill them in their slumber. Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb, who anticipated the possibility, already planned ahead and replaced the daughters\\' gold crowns with the bonnets worn by him and his brothers. As a result, the ogre kills his daughters instead, and goes back to bed. Once he is snoring, Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb directs his siblings out of the house.\\n The ogre wakes up in the morning to discover his grave mistake, puts on his seven-league boots, and races after the boys. They spot the ogre while walking. Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb once again thinks fast and hides in a small nearby cave. The ogre, who is tired, happens to rest close to their hiding spot. Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb instructs his brothers to make their way home, and meanwhile, removes the boots from the sleeping ogre. He puts them on, and the boots, being magical, resize to fit him.\\n Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb uses the boots to make a fortune, and returns to his family\\'s home, where they live happily ever after.\\n The French folktale was first published by Charles Perrault as Le petit Poucet in Histoires ou contes du temps passé in 1697. The French name for the hero, \"Poucet\" /pusɛ/, derives from the French word \"pouce\" /pus/, which means \"thumb\", \"big toe\", or \"inch\". The suffix \"-t\" gives it an affectionate touch, given the morphemes of the language.\\n The beginning mentions that \"le petit Poucet\" was no bigger than a man\\'s thumb when he was born. However, it seems that for the remainder of the story, the protagonist is just a small child, and the tale bears no resemblance to Tom Thumb. As is the nature of traditional stories, passed on orally, the beginning passage might be a remnant from an older tale, ancestral to both Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb and Tom Thumb.\\n The first half of Hop-o\\'-My-Thumb is very similar to Hansel and Gretel. The woodcutter parents are no longer able to support their children and abandon them. The hero lays a trail of breadcrumbs, which thanks to the birds, does not help him get back home. Such laying of trail is found in many stories, one of the oldest being Theseus and the Minotaur.\\n The second half of the story involves an ogre, which the hero outsmarts. It bears resemblance to Sweetheart Roland and Themisto.[6]\\n Gustave Doré contributed 11 illustrations to an 1862 edition of Perrault\\'s book, Les Contes de Perrault.[9]\\n Heinrich Leutemann and Carl Offterdinger illustrated a German fairytale collection, Mein erstes Märchenbuch (My first Fairytale Book), published at the end of the 19th century. Another German illustrator was Alexander Zick.', '\"Donkeyskin\" (French: Peau d\\'Âne) is a French literary fairytale written in verse by Charles Perrault. It was first published in 1695 in a small volume and republished in 1697 in Perrault\\'s Histoires ou contes du temps passé.[1] Andrew Lang included it, somewhat euphemized, in The Grey Fairy Book.[2][3] It is classed among folktales of Aarne-Thompson type 510B, unnatural love.\\n An extremely fortunate and wealthy king lives with his beautiful wife and daughter. The source of the king\\'s riches is his prized, marvelous donkey whose droppings are gold. Suddenly the king\\'s wife is struck by an illness and dies, but not before making her husband promise not to remarry except to a woman whose beauty and attributes equal hers. The king grieves for a lengthy period, but is finally persuaded to seek another wife. It becomes clear that the only woman who fits the promise is his daughter.\\n The princess goes to her godmother, the lilac fairy, for guidance. The fairy advises her goddaughter to make impossible demands to the king as a condition of her consent: a dress all the colors of the sky, a dress the color of the moon, a dress as bright as the sun, and finally, the hide of his precious donkey. Despite the difficulty of the princess\\'s requirements, such is the king\\'s determination to marry her that he grants all of them. The lilac fairy gives her goddaughter a magic chest to contain the dresses, and tells her to leave home, wearing the donkey\\'s skin as a disguise.\\n The princess flees to another kingdom and eventually finds work and lodging at a farm. The princess\\'s appearance is so unsightly that she is nicknamed \"Donkeyskin.\" On holidays, Donkeyskin locks herself in her room, primping and dressing herself in the fine gowns her father had given her. On one such day, the prince of the kingdom comes by her room and glimpses her through the keyhole. The prince falls madly in love and becomes ill with longing; he declares that only a cake baked by Donkeyskin will cure him.\\n While Donkeyskin bakes the cake, her ring somehow falls into the mixture. The prince finds it and declares that he will marry only the woman whose finger it fits. When every other woman in the kingdom fails to fit it, Donkeyskin is summoned to try it on. The ring, to everyone\\'s shock, fits perfectly; and the princess removes the donkey\\'s skin to reveal her rich dress underneath. The lilac fairy appears and explains the whole story to the prince\\'s parents; who, upon learning Donkeyskin\\'s true identity, are elated with the match. Donkeyskin and the prince celebrate their wedding. There, Donkeyskin is reunited with her father, who has remarried to a beautiful widow.\\n The tale is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 510B, \"The Dress of Gold, of Silver, and of Stars (Cap O\\'Rushes)\".[4] However, the tale type was renamed \"Peau d’Asne\" by German folklorist Hans-Jörg Uther in his 2004 revision of the folktale index, while still retaining its numbering.[5]\\n According to scholarship, the tale type features the death of the heroine\\'s mother, her father\\'s incestuous desire, and her fleeing to another kingdom, where she finds work in a menial position.[6][7]\\n In a study, scholar Ruth Bottigheimer notes that, before Perrault\\'s tale, French author Bonaventure des Périers had a heroine (named Pernette) dressed in a donkey\\'s hide (albeit to repel a lover\\'s advances), and, in a later tale, a heroine is called \"Peau d’Asne\", but she is helped by ants. Bottigheimer also suggests that Perrault did not introduce the incest motif, but must have reworked it from an earlier source, namely, Giambattista Basile\\'s The She-Bear (from Pentamerone) and Straparola\\'s Teobaldo (from The Facetious Nights).[8]\\n According to Ton Deker and Stith Thompson, after the heroine flees home and finds work elsewhere, the second part of the tale type (the three balls and three dresses) connects tale type 510B to type 510A, that is, Cinderella.[9][10]\\n In a Greek variant from Epeirus collected by Austrian consul Johann Georg von Hahn with the title Allerleirauh, a widowed king declares he wants to marry his own daughter, despite her protests. To delay him, the princess asks him to fashion her two dresses of gold and a bed that can furrow through the ground to reach any other place. The king gives her the requested items; she takes the dresses, some ducats for money, jumps on the bed and goes to another city. The city\\'s prince, during a hunt, finds the princess, wrapped in furs, in the forest and takes her in as a goose herder. Some time later, this prince holds a grand ball, and the princess attends it with her dress of gold. She dazzles the prince, but escapes the ball back to her low station, and throws some ducats to delay the prince. He becomes interested in finding her, so he holds two more balls. After the third ball, the princess loses one of her shoes and the prince tries it on every maiden, but cannot find its owner. At last, the princess, still wearing her golden dress underneath the animal furs, goes to bring some water to the prince, and he recognizes her.[11]\\n Von Hahn summarized a Greek tale from Smyrna: after his wife dies, a king promises to marry one that can fit the dead queen\\'s ring on her finger. The ring fits on his daughter, and he tries to marry her. To stop her father, she is advised by a being named Miren to ask for three seamless dresses: one of silver, another of gold and a third of pearl. The devil, disguised as an old man, gives the king the dresses, to the princess\\'s horror. Miren guides the princess to a cave in the outskirts of another town, and she gives food and water for the princess for six months. One day, a prince, during a hunt, stops to rest in front of the cave and prepares some food. Drawn by the smell, the princess comes out of the cave; the prince finds her and takes her in to his castle. The princess, called Μαλλιαρή (Malliarí;meaning\"Shaggy\") due to her hairy appearance, she only nods in agreement as she does her chores. The prince then holds three balls, one on each night, and the princess, doffing her shaggy appearance, wears each of the dresses for each night. The prince becomes ill with longing, and his mother asks for some food to be prepared for him. The princess bakes a bread for him and hides her ring, then a clock, and lastly a string of pearls.[12]\\n Tale type ATU 510B also exists in the repertoire of the East Slavs. According to the East Slavic Folktale Catalogue (Russian: СУС, romanized:\\xa0SUS), last updated by scholar Lev Barag\\xa0[ru] in 1979, the type is known as SUS 510B, \"Russian: Свиной чехол, romanized:\\xa0Svinoy chekhol, lit.\\u2009\\'Pigskin\\'\": on threat of an incestuous marriage with her own father, the heroine asks for three dresses to be made (one of stars, one of the moon and one of the sun); she wears a pigskin and finds work elsewhere; a prince holds three balls that she attends, and he goes after her.[13]\\n In a Slovak tale collected by authors August Horislav Škultéty and Pavol Dobšinský with the title Myšacia bundička (\"Mouse Coat\"), a rich man has a lovely wife, but she falls ill and, on her deathbed, makes her husband promise to marry only one as lovely as her. After she dies, the man sends messengers all over the world to try to find another wife that fulfills his requirements, but, failing that, turns to his daughter and tells her he intends to marry her. Aghast at the idea, the man\\'s daughter asks him for three dresses (one studded with stars, one like the moon and one like the sun), then a coat made of mousekin as wedding gifts. The man produces her the dresses; the girl takes them, wears the mouse-skin coat and leaves for parts unknown. She stops by a tree to rest for the night and, the next morning, a king, during his hunt, is alerted of her presence by the barking of his hounds. The king takes the mouse-skin clad girl with him to his castle, where she works as his servant, chopping firewood and helping in the kitchen. Some time later, the king holds three dances, which the mouse-skin clad girl attends, each time wearing one of the dresses her father gave her. She introduces herself to the king, who becomes fascinated with her. After the three dances, the king falls ill with longing, and the mouse-skin clad girl prepares him some food. While the cook is away, she drops the ring on a bowl, and takes it to the king. He finds the ring in his food and sends for the mouse-skin clad girl. He notices her sun dress underneath the mouseskin coat, and takes off the animal coat. He recognizes her as the woman from the dances and marries her.[14]\\n In a South Slavic tale collected by Friedrich Salomon Krauss with the title Vom Kaiser, der seine eigne Tochter heirathen wollte (\"About the Emperor who wanted to marry his own daughter\"), an emperor marries a woman with a star on her forehead, and she gives birth to a girl with the same birthmark. On her deathbed, years later, the empress makes her husband promise to only marry one with a similar mark. After she dies, the emperor tries to find a similar looking woman, to no avail, and, convinced by one of his ministers, decides to marry his own daughter, who does fulfill his dead wife\\'s requirements. Abhorring the idea, the princess runs and cries, until an old woman appears to her with some advice: she is to ask him for three dresses (a silk dress, a silver dress, and a golden dress) that can fit into a nutshell, and a coat made of mouseskin. The princess gets the dresses and the mouseskin coat, places two ducks in a bathtub to trick her father she is taking a bath, and escapes from the palace. She reaches another kingdom and rests by the woods. Some time later, the king\\'s son finds her during a hunt, alerted by the bark of his hounds. The king\\'s son takes her in as a servant, and she works as a goose-herd. The king\\'s other servants mockingly call her \"Aschenbrödel\". Eventually, the king organizes a grand ball, to which noblemen and noblewoman are invited. The princess, secretly, takes off the mouseskin coat and goes to the first ball with the silken dress. Later, the king organizes a second ball, which the princess attends in her silver dress. Lastly, in a third ball, she wears the golden dress, but, before the princess leaves, the prince slips his ring on her finger. Some time later, the prince falls ill, and the cook prepares some food for him, and drops the ring on a cup of milk. The prince drinks the milk and finds the ring inside it, then sends for the mouseskin clad princess. She comes to his chambers and tells him her life story. The prince marries her, and she gives birth to twins, a girl with a star on the forehead and a boy. The princess pays a visit to her father and brings her children with her. Father and daughter reconcile, and the emperor punishes the ministers.[15]\\n Type 510B in the Bulgarian Folktale Catalogue is indexed as \"Дървената мома (Патарана)\" (\"The Wooden Maiden (Patarana)\"): the heroine\\'s father either vows to marry his daughter because an item of apparel fits her (e.g., a ring or a shoe), or because she has a unique birthmark; the heroine delays the wedding by asking him to provide her with wonderful dresses (of star, sun and the sky; or of gold and silver; or decorated with flowers, animals and birds), and flees home either wearing a skin of an animal or a wooden garment; she later finds work in a lowly position for another prince, and attends a festival with her splendid garments; at the end of the tale, the princess drops the prince\\'s ring in a dish that she prepares to the prince.[16]\\n According to Portuguese scholars Isabel Cárdigos and Paulo Jorge Correia, tale type ATU 510B also exists in the Portuguese Folktale Catalogue with the title Peau d’Âne or Portuguese: A princesa na Pele de Burro, lit.\\u2009\\'The princess in the Donkeyskin\\'.[17][18]\\n Professor James Taggart collected a Spanish tale from informant Maximina Castaño. In her tale, a man and a woman have a daughter. Before she dies, the woman makes the man promise to marry one that looks like her. The man decides to marry his own daughter, since it is her that looks like her own mother. The girl cries over the fact, and a neighbouring old woman advises her to ask him for three dresses (the dress of the stars, the dress of the sun, and the dress of the moon). The man produces the dresses. Seeing that the plan failed, the old woman advises the girl to wear a pelican suit she owned and to go out in the world to escape from her own father. She finds work in the king\\'s house as a turkey keeper, but she lets three turkeys die and moves back to the house. Later, the king arranges three dances for his son to find a wife and get married. The girl in the pelican suit takes off the pelican hide, wears her three dresses for the three dances and fascinates the prince, who becomes interested in having her as his wife. On the last night, the prince gives her a ring before she goes back to the kitchen. Later, the prince falls ill with longing, and asks for a custard. His mother orders the girl in the pelican suit to prepare him a custard. The girl cooks a custard and drops his ring inside it. The prince eats the custard and finds the ring, then asks for another custard, then for a third one. The girl in the pelican suit wears the dress of the moon, and goes to meet him. The prince sees her and asks his mother to prepare chocolate drinks for them, for they will marry.[19]\\n In a Sicilian tale collected by folklorist Giuseppe Pitrè with the title Pilusedda, a king and a queen have a beautiful daughter. One day, the queen falls ill and bids her husband marry any other woman that can fit her own ring. After she dies, the princess unsuspectedly tries on her mother\\'s ring, and is found out by the king, who wishes to marry her. Horrified at the idea, the princess consults with a wise man, who advises her to ask her father for three dresses: one the colour of the sky, embroidered in gold and bedecked with stones like the sun, the moon and the planets; one of a sea-green colour and decorated with the houses of the countryside; and one rose-coloured dress with four rows of bangles and tiny golden bells. The king summons his cousin, who is a devil, and arranges the three dresses for his daughter. As a last resort, the wise man gives the princess three hazelnuts and advises her to wear a horse-skin as disguise. The princess does so and flees to another kingdom, where she is found by a prince\\'s gamekeeper and brought to the castle as a kitchen maid. She prepares the prince three pieces of bread on different occasions, and places her father\\'s watch, her father\\'s tiepin and a golden ring inside. The prince finds the objects inside the food and suspects Pilusedda is more than what she appears. Later, the prince invites Pilusedda to accompany him to the Royal Chapel, but she declines. After he leaves, she takes off the horse-skin, cracks open a hazelnut and wears one of the dresses her father gave her to the chapel, where she dazzles the prince. After her third visit to the Royal Chapel, the prince follows her carriage and discovers the mysterious maiden at the chapel was Pilusedda. They marry.[20]\\n Tale type ATU 510B is known in Estonia as Kuninga köögitüdruk  (\"The King\\'s Kitchen Maid\"): a father (sometime a king) wishes to marry his daughter, but she tries to buy time by asking for dresses of stars, sun and moon. The girl flees with the dresses to another kingdom where she finds work as a kitchen maid. She attends the prince\\'s balls with the dresses; he recognizes her when she goes to his chambers and marries her.[21]\\n Lithuanian ethnologist Jonas Balys\\xa0[lt], in his analysis of Lithuanian folktales (published in 1936), named type 510B as Mēnesio, saulės ir žvaigždžių rūbai (\"The Clothes of the Moon, the Sun and the Stars\"), with 39 variants reported until then. In the Lithuanian tale type, a man decides to marry his daughter because she looks like her dead mother, the man\\'s wife. The daughter tricks her father into giving her the titular clothes of the moon, the sun and the stars, flees to another kingdom and finds work there. The girl goes to church three times with the dresses, and loses her shoe on the third time. The king then finds her with the shoe and marries her.[22]\\n In a Lithuanian tale collected by August Schleicher with the title Vom der schönen Königstochter (\"About the king\\'s beautiful daughter\"), a king has a beautiful queen with stars around the forehead, sun on the head and the moon on the neck, and a daughter as beautiful as her mother. One day, the queen dies, and the king decides to marry his own daughter. To delay her father\\'s plans, the princess asks him to give her a coat made of louseskin, a silver dress, a diamond ring and golden slippers. The king gives her the requested items, and she escapes to another kingdom wearing the lousekin coat. She finds work as a kitchen servant (where her brother also works), and hides her splendid dresses inside a stone. With the lady of the house\\'s permission, she leaves work, goes to the stone to wear her dresses, and goes to church.[23]\\n According to the Latvian Folktale Catalogue, tale type 510B is known in Latvia as Ķēniņš grib precēt savu meitu (\"A King wants to marry his daughter\"). In this type, either a king wants to marry his daughter, or a brother his sister, and she goes to her mother\\'s grave in search of comfort. The mother\\'s spirit advises her to ask for wonderful dresses, a coat made of animal skin (mouse, dog, wolf, bear) and a self-moving boat or carriage. She escapes with the presents to another kingdom, where she finds work in the kitchen, attends three balls and loses a shoe, which will be the proof of her identity.[24]\\n American folklorist Leonard W. Roberts collected a tale from a Kentucky teller of French descent, in Beattyville, Kentucky. In this tale, titled The Princess in the Donkey Skin, a king plans to marry his daughter to the ugly king of Faraway Land, but the princess refuses and declares she would rather live in a donkey\\'s skin than marry him. Considering it a provocation, the king gives her the donkey\\'s skin and banishes her from the palace. The princess wanders off and finds work with an old woman in her hut. Later, the king of Faraway Land and his son, after a hunt, go to the old woman\\'s hut to eat, and the old woman orders the princess to prepare them dinner. The princess cooks some soup for the royal guests and lets a diamond ring slip inside. The prince eats the soup, finds the ring and pockets it. Meanwhile, the princess is crying in her room, when a fairy godmother appears and turns her into a \"purty\" girl, with diamonds in her hair and with a beautiful dress. The princess, in new clothes, goes to the balcony under the moonlight. The prince sees her and, falling in love, comes to court her. The princess then leaves. The prince returns later for a second visit and meets the princess again. With the ring in hand, he decides to look for its owner all over the world. Failing that, he then goes back to the girl in the donkey\\'s skin and places her ring on her finger. Finding the ring\\'s owner, the prince and princess marry.[25]', 'The Adventures of Tintin (French: Les Aventures de Tintin; [lez‿avɑ̃tyʁ də tɛ̃tɛ̃]) is a series of 24 comic albums created by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, who wrote under the pen name Hergé. The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. By 2007, a century after Hergé\\'s birth in 1907,[1] Tintin had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies,[2] and had been adapted for radio, television, theatre, and film.\\n The series first appeared in French on 10 January 1929 in Le Petit Vingtième (The Little Twentieth), a youth supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle (The Twentieth Century). The success of the series led to serialised strips published in Belgium\\'s leading newspaper Le Soir (The Evening) and spun into a successful Tintin magazine. In 1950, Hergé created Studios Hergé, which produced the canonical versions of ten Tintin albums. Following Hergé\\'s death in 1983, the final instalment of the series, Tintin and Alph-Art, was released posthumously.\\n The series is set during a largely realistic[3] 20th century. Its protagonist is Tintin, a courageous young Belgian reporter and adventurer aided by his faithful dog Snowy (Milou in the original French edition). Other allies include the brash and cynical Captain Haddock, the intelligent but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (French: Professeur Tournesol), incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (French: Dupont et Dupond), and the opera diva Bianca Castafiore.\\n The series has been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Hergé\\'s signature ligne claire (\"clear line\") style.[4] Its well-researched[5] plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories feature slapstick humour, offset by dashes of sophisticated satire with political or cultural commentary.\\n \"The idea for the character of Tintin and the sort of adventures that would befall him came to me, I believe, in five minutes, the moment I first made a sketch of the figure of this hero: that is to say, he had not haunted my youth nor even my dreams. Although it\\'s possible that as a child I imagined myself in the role of a sort of Tintin\".\\n —Hergé, 15 November 1966.[6] Georges Prosper Remi, best known under the pen name Hergé, was employed as an illustrator at Le Vingtième Siècle (The Twentieth Century), a staunchly Roman Catholic, conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé\\'s native Brussels. Run by the Abbé Norbert Wallez, the paper described itself as a \"Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information\" and disseminated a fascist viewpoint.[7] Wallez appointed Hergé editor of a new Thursday youth supplement, titled Le Petit Vingtième (\"The Little Twentieth\").[8] Propagating Wallez\\'s sociopolitical views to its young readership, it contained explicitly pro-fascist and antisemitic sentiment.[9] In addition to editing the supplement, Hergé illustrated L\\'extraordinaire aventure de Flup, Nénesse, Poussette et Cochonnet (The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet),[10] a comic strip authored by a member of the newspaper\\'s sport staff. Dissatisfied with this, Hergé wanted to write and draw his own cartoon strip.[11]\\n He already had experience creating comic strips. From July 1926, he had written a strip about a Boy Scout patrol leader titled Les Aventures de Totor C.P. des Hannetons (The Adventures of Totor, Scout Leader of the Cockchafers) for the Scouting newspaper Le Boy Scout Belge (The Belgian Boy Scout).[11] Totor was a strong influence on Tintin,[12] with Hergé describing the latter as being like Totor\\'s younger brother.[6] Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier stated that graphically, Totor and Tintin were \"virtually identical\" except for the Scout uniform,[13] also noting many similarities between their respective adventures, particularly in the illustration style, the fast pace of the story, and the use of humour.[14] He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium such as the systematic use of speech bubbles—found in such American comics as George McManus\\' Bringing up Father, George Herriman\\'s Krazy Kat, and Rudolph Dirks\\'s Katzenjammer Kids, copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper\\'s reporter Léon Degrelle.[15]\\n Although Hergé wanted to send Tintin to the United States, Wallez ordered him to set his adventure in the Soviet Union, acting as antisocialist propaganda for children. The result, Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, was serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from January 1929 to May 1930.[17] Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organised a publicity stunt at the Paris Gare du Nord railway station, following which he organised the publication of the story in book form.[18] The story\\'s popularity led to an increase in sales, so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants.[19] At Wallez\\'s direction, in June he began serialisation of the second story, Tintin in the Congo, designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it was accused of racism, but at the time was uncontroversial and popular, and further publicity stunts were held to increase sales.[20]\\n For the third adventure, Tintin in America, serialised from September 1931 to October 1932, Hergé finally got to deal with a scenario of his own choice, and used the work to push an anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper\\'s ultraconservative ideology.[21] The Adventures of Tintin had been syndicated to a Catholic magazine named Cœurs Vaillants (Brave Hearts) since 1930, and Hergé was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers, too.[22]\\n Hergé wrote a string of Adventures of Tintin, sending his character to real locations such as the Belgian Congo, United States, Egypt, India, Tibet, China, and the United Kingdom. He also sent Tintin to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of San Theodoros, the East European kingdom of Syldavia, or the fascist state of Borduria—whose leader\\'s name, Müsstler, was a portmanteau of the names of the Nazi German Führer Adolf Hitler and the Italian Fascist Prime Minister Benito Mussolini.[23]\\n In May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II spread further across Europe. Although Hergé briefly fled to France and was considered a self-imposed exile, he ultimately decided to return to his occupied homeland.[24] For political reasons, the Nazi authorities closed down Le Vingtième Siècle, leaving Hergé unemployed.[25] In search of employment, he got a job as an illustrator at Belgium\\'s leading newspaper, Le Soir (The Evening), which was allowed to continue publication under German management.[26] On 17 October 1940, he was made editor of the children\\'s supplement, Le Soir Jeunesse, in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures.[27] In this new, more repressive political climate of German-occupied Belgium, Hergé could no longer politicize The Adventures of Tintin lest he be arrested by the Gestapo. As Harry Thompson noted, Tintin\\'s role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer.[28]\\n In September 1944, the Allies entered Brussels and Hergé\\'s German employers fled. Le Soir was shut down and The Adventures of Tintin was put on hold.[29]\\nThen in 1946, Hergé accepted an invitation from Belgian comic publisher Raymond Leblanc and his new publishing company Le Lombard to continue The Adventures of Tintin in the new Le journal de Tintin (Tintin magazine).[30]\\nHergé quickly learned that he no longer had the independence he preferred; he was required to produce two coloured pages a week for Leblanc\\'s magazine, a tall order.[31]\\n In 1950, Hergé began to poach the better members of the Tintin magazine staff to work in the large house on Avenue Louise that contained the fledgling Studios Hergé.[32] Bob De Moor (who imitated Hergé\\'s style and did half the work),[32] Guy Dessicy (colourist), and Marcel DeHaye (secretary) were the nucleus. To this, Hergé added Jacques Martin (imitated Hergé\\'s style), Roger Leloup (detailed, realistic drawings), Eugène Evany (later chief of the Studios),[30] Michel Demaret (letterer), and Baudouin Van Den Branden (secretary).[33]\\nAs Harry Thompson observed, the idea was to turn the process of creating The Adventures of Tintin into a \"veritable production line, the artwork passing from person to person, everyone knowing their part, like an artistic orchestra with Hergé conducting\".[34]\\nThe studios produced eight new Tintin albums for Tintin magazine, and coloured and reformatted two old Tintin albums.\\nStudios Hergé continued to release additional publications until Hergé\\'s death in 1983. In 1986, a 24th unfinished album was released, the studios were disbanded, and the assets were transferred to the Hergé Foundation.[35]\\n Tintin is a young Belgian reporter and adventurer who becomes involved in dangerous cases in which he takes heroic action to save the day. The Adventures may feature Tintin hard at work in his investigative journalism, but seldom is he seen actually turning in a story.\\nReaders and critics have described Tintin as a well-rounded yet open-ended, intelligent, and creative character, noting that his lack of backstory and neutral personality permits a reflection of the evil, folly, and foolhardiness which surrounds him. The character never compromises his Boy Scout ideals, which represent Hergé\\'s own, and his status allows the reader to assume his position within the story, rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist.[36] Tintin\\'s iconic representation enhances this aspect, with Scott McCloud noting that it \"allows readers to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world\".[37]\\n Snowy (Milou in Hergé\\'s original version), a white Wire Fox Terrier dog, is Tintin\\'s loyal companion. Like Captain Haddock, Snowy is fond of Loch Lomond brand Scotch whisky, and his occasional bouts of drinking tend to get him into unintentional trouble, as does his only fear: arachnids.\\n Captain Archibald Haddock (Capitaine Haddock in Hergé\\'s original version) is a Merchant Marine sea captain and Tintin\\'s best friend. Introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws, Haddock is initially depicted as a weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Chevalier François de Hadoque). The Captain\\'s coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin\\'s often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. The hot-tempered Haddock uses a range of colourful insults and curses to express his feelings, such as \"billions of bilious blue blistering barnacles!\" (Mille milliards de mille sabords!) or \"ten thousand thundering typhoons!\"\\n Professor Cuthbert Calculus (Professeur Tryphon Tournesol in Hergé\\'s original version; tournesol is the French word for \\'sunflower\\') is an absent-minded and partially deaf physicist and a regular character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock. He was introduced in Red Rackham\\'s Treasure, and based partially on Auguste Piccard, a Swiss physicist.[38]\\n \"Everybody wants to be Tintin: generation after generation. In a world of Rastapopouloses, Tricklers and Carreidases—or, more prosaically, Jolyon Waggs and Bolt-the-builders—Tintin represents an unattainable ideal of goodness, cleanness, authenticity\".\\n —Literary critic Tom McCarthy, 2006[39] Hergé\\'s supporting characters have been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been compared with that of the characters of Charles Dickens.[40] Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world[3] in which to set his protagonists\\' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.[41]\\n Thomson and Thompson (Dupont et Dupond in Hergé\\'s original version) are two incompetent detectives who look like identical twins, their only discernible difference being the shape of their moustaches.[42] First introduced in Cigars of the Pharaoh, they provide much of the comic relief throughout the series, being afflicted with chronic spoonerisms. They are extremely clumsy, thoroughly incompetent, and usually bent on arresting the wrong character. The detectives usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks except when sent abroad; during those missions they attempt the national costume of the locality they are visiting, but instead dress in conspicuously stereotypical folkloric attire which makes them stand apart. The detectives were based partly on Hergé\\'s father Alexis and uncle Léon, identical twins who often took walks together, wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks.\\n Bianca Castafiore is an opera singer of whom Haddock is terrified. She was first introduced in King Ottokar\\'s Sceptre and seems to appear wherever the protagonists travel, along with her maid Irma and pianist Igor Wagner. Although amiable and strong-willed, she is also comically foolish, whimsical, absent-minded, talkative, and seemingly unaware that her voice is shrill and appallingly loud. Her speciality is the Jewel Song (Ah! Je ris de me voir si belle en ce miroir / Ah! My beauty past compare, these jewels bright I wear) from Gounod\\'s opera Faust, which she sings at the least provocation. She is often maternal toward Haddock, of whose dislike she remains ignorant. She often confuses words, especially names, with other words that rhyme with them or of which they remind her; \"Haddock\" is frequently replaced by malapropisms such as \"Paddock\", \"Stopcock\", or \"Hopscotch\", while Nestor, Haddock\\'s butler, is confused with \"Chestor\" and \"Hector\". Her own name means \"white and chaste flower\": a meaning to which Professor Calculus once refers when he breeds a white rose and names it for the singer. She was based upon opera divas in general (according to Hergé\\'s perception), Hergé\\'s Aunt Ninie (who was known for her \"shrill\" singing of opera), and, in the post-war comics, on Maria Callas.[43]\\n Other recurring characters include Nestor the butler, Chang (or Chang-Chong-Chen) the loyal Chinese boy, Rastapopoulos the criminal mastermind, Jolyon Wagg the infuriating (to Haddock) insurance salesman, General Alcazar the South American freedom fighter and (on and off) President of San Theodoros, Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab the Arab emir, and Abdullah his mischievous son, Dr. Müller the evil German psychiatrist, Oliveira da Figueira the friendly Portuguese salesman, Cutts the butcher whose phone number is repeatedly confused with Haddock\\'s, and Allan the henchman of Rastapopoulos and formerly Haddock\\'s first mate.\\n The settings within Tintin have also added depth to the strips. Hergé mixes real and fictional lands into his stories. In King Ottokar\\'s Sceptre (revisited once more in The Calculus Affair) Hergé creates two fictional countries, Syldavia and Borduria, and invites the reader to tour them in text through the insertion of a travel brochure into the storyline.[44] Other fictional lands include Khemed on the Arabian Peninsula and San Theodoros, São Rico, and Nuevo Rico in South America, as well as the kingdom of Gaipajama in India.[45] Apart from these fictitious locations, Tintin also visits real places such as Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Belgian Congo, Peru, India, Egypt, Morocco, Indonesia, Iceland, Nepal, Tibet, and China. Other actual locales used were the Sahara Desert, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Moon.\\n Hergé\\'s extensive research began with The Blue Lotus; Hergé said that \"it was from that time that I undertook research and really interested myself in the people and countries to which I sent Tintin, out of a sense of responsibility to my readers\".[46]\\n Hergé\\'s use of research and photographic reference allowed him to build a realised universe for Tintin, going so far as to create fictionalised countries, dressing them with specific political cultures. These were heavily informed by the cultures evident in Hergé\\'s lifetime. Pierre Skilling has asserted that Hergé saw monarchy as \"the legitimate form of government\", noting that democratic \"values seem underrepresented in [such] a classic Franco-Belgian strip\".[47] Syldavia in particular is described in considerable detail, Hergé creating a history, customs, and a language, which is actually a Slavic-looking transcript of Marols, a working-class Brussels dialect. He set the country in the Balkans, and it is, by his own admission, modelled after Albania.[48] The country finds itself threatened by neighbouring Borduria, with an attempted annexation appearing in King Ottokar\\'s Sceptre. This situation parallels the Italian conquest of Albania, and that of Czechoslovakia and Austria by expansionist Nazi Germany prior to World War II.[49]\\n Hergé\\'s use of research would include months of preparation for Tintin\\'s voyage to the Moon in the two-part storyline spread across Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon. His research for the storyline was noted in New Scientist: \"The considerable research undertaken by Hergé enabled him to come very close to the type of space suit that would be used in future Moon exploration, although his portrayal of the type of rocket that was actually used was a long way off the mark\". The Moon rocket is based on the German V-2 rockets.[50]\\n In his youth, Hergé admired Benjamin Rabier and suggested that a number of images within Tintin in the Land of the Soviets reflected his influence, particularly the pictures of animals. René Vincent, the Art Deco designer, also affected early Tintin adventures: \"His influence can be detected at the beginning of the Soviets, where my drawings are designed along a decorative line, like an \\'S\\'\".[51] Hergé also readily adopted the image of round noses from George McManus, feeling they were \"so much fun that I used them, without scruples!\"[52]\\n During the extensive research Hergé carried out for The Blue Lotus, he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and woodcuts. This is especially noticeable in the seascapes, which are reminiscent of works by Hokusai and Hiroshige.[53]\\n Hergé also declared Mark Twain an influence, although this admiration may have led him astray when depicting Incas as having no knowledge of an upcoming solar eclipse in Prisoners of the Sun, an error T.\\xa0F. Mills attributed to an attempt to portray \"Incas in awe of a latter-day \\'Connecticut Yankee\\'\".[54]\\n Tintin first appeared in English in the weekly British children\\'s comic Eagle in 1951 with the story King Ottokar\\'s Sceptre.[a][55] It was translated in conjunction with Casterman, Tintin\\'s publishers, and starts by describing Tintin as \"a French boy\". Snowy was called by his French name Milou.[56]\\n The process of translating Tintin into British English was then commissioned in 1958 by Methuen, Hergé\\'s British publishers. It was a joint operation, headed by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner,[57] who worked closely with Hergé to attain a translation as true as possible to the original work.[58] Due in part to the large amount of language-specific word play (such as punning) in the series, especially the jokes which played on Professor Calculus\\' partial deafness, it was never the intention to translate literally; instead they strove to fashion a work whose idioms and jokes would be meritorious in their own right. Despite the free hand Hergé afforded the two, they worked closely with the original text, asking for regular assistance to understand Hergé\\'s intentions.[58]\\n The British translations were also Anglicised to appeal to British customs and values. Milou, for example, was renamed Snowy at the translators\\' discretion. Captain Haddock\\'s Le château de Moulinsart was renamed Marlinspike Hall.[59]\\n When it came time to translate The Black Island, which is set in Great Britain, the opportunity was taken to redraw the entire book. Methuen had decided that the book did not portray Great Britain accurately enough and had compiled a list of 131 errors of detail which needed to be put right, such as ensuring that the British police were unarmed and ensuring that scenes of the British countryside would be acceptable to British readers.[58] The resulting 1966 album is the dramatically updated and redrawn version most commonly available today.[60] As of the early 21st century,[update] Egmont publishes Tintin books in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.[61]\\n The Tintin books have had relatively limited popularity in the United States.[62]\\n The works were first adapted for the American English market by Golden Books, a branch of the Western Publishing Company in the 1950s. The albums were translated from French into American English with some artwork panels blanked except for the speech balloons. This was done to remove content considered to be inappropriate for children, such as drunkenness and free mixing of races.[63] The albums were not popular and only six were published in mixed order.[64] The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Hergé to be more acceptable, and they currently appear this way in published editions around the world.[64]\\n From 1966 to 1979, Children\\'s Digest included monthly instalments of The Adventures of Tintin. These serialisations served to increase Tintin\\'s popularity, introducing him to many thousands of new readers in the United States.[b][64]\\n Atlantic Monthly Press, in cooperation with Little, Brown and Company beginning in the 1970s, republished the albums based on the British translations. Alterations were made to vocabulary not well known to an American audience (such as gaol, tyre, saloon, and spanner). As of the early 21st century,[update] Little, Brown and Company (owned by the Hachette Book Group USA) continues to publish Tintin books in the United States.[65]\\n Moulinsart\\'s official Tintin app in Apple\\'s App Store, launched with the release of the digital version of Tintin in the Congo on 5 June 2015, features brand new English language translations by journalist, writer and Tintin expert Michael Farr.[66]\\n The English-language Adventures of Tintin books were originally published with handwritten lettering created by cartographer Neil Hyslop.[67] 1958\\'s The Crab with the Golden Claws was the first to be published with Hyslop\\'s lettering. Hyslop was given versions of Hergé\\'s artwork with blank panels.[67] Hyslop would write his English script on a clear cellophane-like material, aiming to fit within the original speech bubble.[67] Occasionally the size of the bubbles would need to be adjusted if the translated text would not fit.[67] In the early 2000s, Tintin\\'s English publishers Egmont discontinued publishing books featuring Hyslop\\'s handwritten lettering, instead publishing books with text created with digital fonts. This change was instigated by publisher Casterman and Hergé\\'s estate managers Moulinsart, who decided to replace localised hand-lettering with a single computerised font for all Tintin titles worldwide.[68]\\n On 1 June 2006, the Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet\\'s Light of Truth Award upon the Hergé Foundation, along with South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.[69] The award was in recognition of Hergé\\'s book Tintin in Tibet, Hergé\\'s most personal adventure,[70] which the executive director of ICT Europe Tsering Jampa noted was \"for many\\xa0... their introduction to the awe-inspiring landscape and culture of Tibet\".[71] In 2001, the Hergé Foundation demanded the recall of the Chinese translation of the work, which had been released with the title Tintin in Chinese Tibet. The work was subsequently published with the correct translation of the title.[72] Accepting on behalf of the Hergé Foundation, Hergé\\'s widow Fanny Rodwell said: \"We never thought that this story of friendship would have a resonance more than 40 years later\".[69]\\n The study of Tintin, sometimes referred to as \"Tintinology\", has become the life work of some literary critics in Belgium, France and the United Kingdom.[73] Belgian author Philippe Goddin has written Hergé et Tintin reporters: Du Petit Vingtième au Journal Tintin (1986, later republished in English as Hergé and Tintin Reporters: From \"Le Petit Vingtième\" to \"Tintin\" Magazine in 1987) and Hergé et les Bigotudos (1993) amongst other books on the series. In 1983, French author Benoît Peeters released Le Monde d\\'Hergé, subsequently published in English as Tintin and the World of Hergé in 1988.[74] English reporter Michael Farr has written works such as Tintin, 60 Years of Adventure (1989), Tintin: The Complete Companion (2001),[75] Tintin & Co. (2007)[76] and The Adventures of Hergé (2007),[77] while English television producer Harry Thompson authored Tintin: Hergé and his Creation (1991).[78]\\n Literary critics, primarily in French-speaking Europe, have also examined The Adventures of Tintin. In 1984, Jean-Marie Apostolidès published his study of the Adventures of Tintin from a more \"adult\" perspective as Les Métamorphoses de Tintin, published in English as The Metamorphoses of Tintin, or Tintin for Adults in 2010.[79] In reviewing Apostolidès\\' book, Nathan Perl-Rosenthal of The New Republic thought that it was \"not for the faint of heart: it is densely-packed with close textual analysis and laden with psychological jargon\".[80] Following Apostolidès\\'s work, French psychoanalyst Serge Tisseron examined the series in his books Tintin et les Secrets de Famille (\"Tintin and the Family Secrets\"), which was published in 1990,[81] and Tintin et le Secret d\\'Hergé (\"Tintin and Hergé\\'s Secret\"), published in 1993.[82]\\n The first English-language work of literary criticism devoted to the series was Tintin and the Secret of Literature, written by the novelist Tom McCarthy and published in 2006. McCarthy compares Hergé\\'s work with that of Aeschylus, Honoré de Balzac, Joseph Conrad, and Henry James and argues that the series contains the key to understanding literature itself.[83] McCarthy considered the Adventures of Tintin to be \"stupendously rich\",[40] containing \"a mastery of plot and symbol, theme and sub-text\"[84] which, influenced by Tisseron\\'s psychoanalytical readings of the work, he believed could be deciphered to reveal a series of recurring themes, ranging from bartering[85] to implicit sexual intercourse[86] that Hergé had featured throughout the series. Reviewing the book in The Telegraph, Toby Clements argued that McCarthy\\'s work, and literary criticism of Hergé\\'s comic strips in general, cut \"perilously close\" to simply feeding \"the appetite of those willing to cross the line between enthusiast and obsessive\" in the Tintinological community.[87]\\n The earliest stories in The Adventures of Tintin have been criticised[89] for animal cruelty; colonialism; violence; and ethnocentric, caricatured portrayals of non-Europeans.[90] While the Hergé Foundation has presented such criticism as naïveté and scholars of Hergé such as Harry Thompson have said that \"Hergé did what he was told by the Abbé Wallez\",[91] Hergé himself felt that his background made it impossible to avoid prejudice, stating: \"I was fed the prejudices of the bourgeois society that surrounded me\".[52]\\n In Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, the Bolsheviks were presented as villains. Hergé drew on Moscow Unveiled, a work given to him by Wallez and authored by Joseph Douillet, the former Belgian consul in Russia, that is highly critical of the Soviet regime, although Hergé contextualised this by noting that in Belgium, at the time a devout Catholic nation, \"anything Bolshevik was atheist\".[52] In the story, Bolshevik leaders are motivated by personal greed and a desire to deceive the world. Tintin discovers, buried, \"the hideout where Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin have collected together wealth stolen from the people\". In 1999, the issue of Tintin\\'s politics was the subject of a debate in the French parliament;[92] this event prompted the British weekly newspaper The Economist to publish an editorial on the matter.[93]\\n Tintin in the Congo has been criticised as presenting the Africans as naïve and primitive.[94] In the original work, Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing a class of African children: \"My dear friends. I am going to talk to you today about your fatherland: Belgium\".[c] Hergé redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in mathematics.[95] Hergé later admitted the flaws in the original story, excusing it saying: \"I portrayed these Africans according to\\xa0... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time\".[52] Sue Buswell, who was the editor of Tintin at Methuen, summarised the perceived problems with the book in 1988 as \"all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals\",[d] although Thompson noted her quote may have been \"taken out of context\".[96]\\n Drawing on André Maurois\\' Les Silences du colonel Bramble, Hergé presents Tintin as a big-game hunter, accidentally killing fifteen antelope as opposed to the one needed for the evening meal. However, concerns over the number of dead animals led Tintin\\'s Scandinavian publishers to request changes. A page of Tintin killing a rhinoceros by drilling a hole in its back and inserting a stick of dynamite was deemed excessive; Hergé replaced the page with one in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin\\'s rifle while he sleeps under a tree.[88] In 2007, the UK\\'s Commission for Racial Equality called for the book to be pulled from shelves after a complaint, stating: \"It beggars belief that in this day and age Borders would think it acceptable to sell and display Tintin in the Congo.\"[97] In August 2007, a Congolese student filed a complaint in Brussels that the book was an insult to the Congolese people. Public prosecutors investigated, and a criminal case was initiated, although the matter was transferred to a civil court.[98] Belgium\\'s Centre for Equal Opportunities warned against \"over-reaction and hyper political correctness\".[99]\\n Hergé altered some of the early albums in subsequent editions, usually at the demand of publishers. For example, at the instigation of his American publishers, many of the African characters in Tintin in America were re-coloured to make their race Caucasian or ambiguous.[100] The Shooting Star originally had an American villain with the Jewish surname of \"Blumenstein\".[101] This proved controversial, as the character exhibited exaggerated, stereotypically Jewish characteristics. \"Blumenstein\" was changed to an American with a less ethnically specific name, Mr. Bohlwinkel, in later editions and subsequently to a South American of a fictional country São Rico. Hergé later discovered that \\'Bohlwinkel\\' was also a Jewish name.[49] In recent years, even Tintin\\'s politics of peace have been investigated.[102]\\n The Adventures of Tintin has been adapted in a variety of media besides the original comic strip and its collections. Hergé encouraged adaptations and members of his studio working on the animated films. After Hergé\\'s death in 1983, the Hergé Foundation and Moulinsart, the foundation\\'s commercial and copyright wing, became responsible for authorising adaptations and exhibitions.[103]\\n Two animated television adaptations and one radio adaptation have been made.\\n Hergé\\'s Adventures of Tintin (Les aventures de Tintin d\\'après Hergé) (1957) was the first production of Belvision Studios.[104] Ten of Hergé\\'s books were adapted, each serialised into a set of five-minute episodes, with 103 episodes produced.[e] The series was directed by Ray Goossens and written by Belgian comic artist Greg, later editor-in-chief of Tintin magazine, and produced by Raymond Leblanc.[f] Most stories in the series varied widely from the original books, often changing whole plots.[104]\\n The Adventures of Tintin (Les aventures de Tintin) (1991–92) was the more successful Tintin television series. An adaptation of twenty-one Tintin books,[g][105] it was directed by Stéphane Bernasconi and was produced by Ellipse (France) and Canadian Nelvana on behalf of the Hergé Foundation. The series adhered closely to the albums to such an extent that panels from the original were often transposed directly to the screen.[105] The series aired in over fifty countries and was released on DVD. It aired in the US on HBO.[106]\\n The Adventures of Tintin (1992–93) radio series was produced by BBC Radio 5. The dramas starred Richard Pearce as Tintin and Andrew Sachs as Snowy. Captain Haddock was played by Leo McKern in Series One and Lionel Jeffries in Series Two, Professor Calculus was played by Stephen Moore and Thomson and Thompson were played by Charles Kay.[107]\\n The Adventures of Tintin were also released as radio dramas on LP and compact cassette recordings in French language versions in Belgium, France and Canada, German language versions in Germany, Swedish language versions in Sweden, Danish language versions in Denmark and Norwegian language versions in Norway.[107]\\n Five feature-length Tintin films were made before Hergé\\'s death in 1983 and one more in 2011.\\n The Crab with the Golden Claws (Le crabe aux pinces d\\'or) (1947) was the first successful attempt to adapt one of the comics into a feature film. Written and directed by Claude Misonne and João B Michiels, the film was a stop-motion puppet production created by a small Belgian studio.[108]\\n Tintin and the Golden Fleece (Tintin et le mystère de la Toison d\\'Or) (1961), the first live-action Tintin film, was adapted not from one of Hergé\\'s Adventures of Tintin but instead from an original script written by André Barret and Rémo Forlani.[109] Directed by Jean-Jacques Vierne and starring Jean-Pierre Talbot as Tintin and Georges Wilson as Haddock, the plot involves Tintin travelling to Istanbul to collect the Golden Fleece, a ship left to Haddock in the will of his friend, Themistocle Paparanic. Whilst in the city however, Tintin and Haddock discover that a group of villains also want possession of the ship, believing that it would lead them to a hidden treasure.[109]\\n Tintin and the Blue Oranges (Tintin et les oranges bleues) (1964), the second live action Tintin film, was released due to the success of the first. Again based upon an original script, once more by André Barret, it was directed by Philippe Condroyer and starred Talbot as Tintin and Jean Bouise as Haddock.[110] The plot reveals a new invention, the blue orange, that can grow in the desert and solve world famines, devised by Calculus\\' friend, the Spanish Professor Zalamea. An emir whose interests are threatened by the invention of the blue orange proceeds to kidnap both Zalamea and Calculus, and Tintin and Haddock travel to Spain in order to rescue them.[110]\\n Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (Tintin et le temple du soleil) (1969), the first traditional animation Tintin film, was adapted from two of Hergé\\'s Adventures of Tintin: The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun. The first full-length, animated film from Raymond Leblanc\\'s Belvision, which had recently completed its television series based upon the Tintin stories; it was directed by Eddie Lateste and featured a musical score by the critically acclaimed composer François Rauber. The adaptation is mostly faithful, although the Seven Crystal Balls portion of the story was heavily condensed.[110]\\n Tintin and the Lake of Sharks (Tintin et le lac aux requins) (1972), the second traditional animation Tintin film and the last Tintin release for nearly 40 years, it was based on an original script by Greg and directed by Raymond Leblanc.[111] Belvision\\'s second feature takes Tintin to Syldavia to outwit his old foe Rastapopoulos. While the look of the film is richer, the story is less convincing.[112] The movie was subsequently adapted into a comic album made up of stills from the film.[113]\\n The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (2011) was Steven Spielberg\\'s motion capture 3D film based on three Hergé albums: The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941), The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), and Red Rackham\\'s Treasure (1944).[114] Peter Jackson\\'s company Weta Digital provided the animation and special effects. The movie received positive reviews and was a box office success.\\n I, Tintin (Moi, Tintin, 1976) was produced by Belvision Studios and Pierre Film.[115]\\n Tintin and I (Tintin et moi, 2003), a documentary film directed by Anders Høgsbro Østergaard and co-produced by companies from Denmark, Belgium, France, and Switzerland, was based on a taped interview with Hergé by Numa Sadoul from 1971. Although the interview was published as a book, Hergé was allowed to edit the work prior to publishing and much of the interview was excised.[116] Years after Hergé\\'s death, the filmmaker returned to the original tapes and restored Hergé\\'s often personal, insightful thoughts—and in the process brought viewers closer to the world of Tintin and Hergé.[115] It was broadcast in the US on the PBS network on 11 July 2006.[117]\\n Sur les traces de Tintin (On the trail of Tintin, 2010) was a five-part documentary television series which recaps several albums of the book series by combining comic panels (motionless or otherwise) with live-action imagery, with commentary provided.\\n Hergé himself helped to create two stage plays, collaborating with humourist Jacques Van Melkebeke. Tintin in the Indies: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond (1941) covers much of the second half of Cigars of the Pharaoh as Tintin attempts to rescue a stolen blue diamond. Mr. Boullock\\'s Disappearance (1941–1942) has Tintin, Snowy, and Thomson and Thompson travel around the world and back to Brussels again to unmask an impostor trying to lay claim to a missing millionaire\\'s fortune. The plays were performed at the Théâtre Royal des Galeries in Brussels. The scripts of the plays are lost.[119]\\n In the late 1970s and early 1980s, two Tintin plays were produced at the Arts Theatre in the West End of London, adapted by Geoffrey Case for the Unicorn Theatre Company. These were Tintin\\'s Great American Adventure, based on the comic Tintin in America (1976–1977) and Tintin and the Black Island, based on The Black Island (1980–81); this second play later toured.[h][118]\\n A musical based on The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun premièred on 15 September 2001 at the Stadsschouwburg (City Theatre) in Antwerp, Belgium. It was entitled Kuifje – De Zonnetempel (De Musical) (\"Tintin – Temple of the Sun (The Musical)\") and was broadcast on Canal Plus, before moving on to Charleroi in 2002 as Tintin – Le Temple du Soleil – Le Spectacle Musical.[120]\\n The Young Vic theatre company in London ran Hergé\\'s Adventures of Tintin, a musical version of Tintin in Tibet, at the Barbican Arts Centre (2005–2006); the production was directed by Rufus Norris and was adapted by Norris and David Greig.[121] The show was successfully revived at the Playhouse Theatre in the West End of London before touring (2006–2007)[122] to celebrate the centenary of Hergé\\'s birth in 2007.[1]\\n Tintin began appearing in video games when Infogrames Entertainment, SA, a French game company, released the side scroller Tintin on the Moon in 1989.[123] The same company released a platform game titled Tintin in Tibet in 1995 for the Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis.[124] Another platform game from Infogrames titled Prisoners of the Sun was released the following year for the Super NES, Microsoft Windows, and Game Boy Color.[125]\\n In 2001, Tintin became 3D in Tintin: Destination Adventure, released by Infogrames for Windows and PlayStation.[126] Then in 2011, an action-adventure game called The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, a tie-in to the 2011 movie, was released by Ubisoft in October.[127] In 2020, a match-3 mobile game called Tintin Match was released by 5th Planet games.[128] An adventure game, titled Tintin Reporter: Cigars of the Pharaoh, was released by Microids in 2023.[129]\\n Images from the series have long been licensed for use on merchandise, the success of Tintin magazine helping to create a market for such items. Tintin\\'s image has been used to sell a wide variety of products, from alarm clocks to underpants. Countless separate items related to the character have been available, with some becoming collectors\\' items in their own right.[131]\\n The Hergé Foundation has maintained control of the licenses, through Moulinsart (now Tintin Imaginatio),[132] the commercial wing of the foundation. Speaking in 2002, Peter Horemans, the then director general at Moulinsart, noted this control: \"We have to be very protective of the property. We don\\'t take lightly any potential partners and we have to be very selective\\xa0... for him to continue to be as popular as he is, great care needs to be taken of his use\".[133] However, the Foundation has been criticised by scholars as \"trivialising the work of Hergé by concentrating on the more lucrative merchandising\" in the wake of a move in the late 1990s to charge them for using relevant images to illustrate their papers on the series.[134]\\n Tintin memorabilia and merchandise has allowed a chain of stores based solely on the character to become viable. The first shop was launched in 1984 in Covent Garden, London.[130] Tintin shops have also opened in both Bruges and Brussels in Belgium, and in Montpellier, France. In 2014, a Tintin shop opened in Taguig, the Philippines, only the second of its kind in Southeast Asia. The first Tintin shop in Southeast Asia opened in Singapore in 2010.[135]\\nThe British bookstore chain, Ottakar\\'s, founded in 1987, was named after the character of King Ottokar from the Tintin book King Ottokar\\'s Sceptre, and their shops stocked a large amount of Tintin merchandise until their takeover by Waterstone\\'s in 2006.[136]\\n Tintin\\'s image has been used on postage stamps on numerous occasions.\\nThe first Tintin postage stamp was an eight-franc stamp issued by Belgian Post for the 50th anniversary of the publication of Tintin\\'s first adventure on 29 September 1979, featuring Tintin and Snowy looking through a magnifying glass at several stamps.[138]\\nIn 1999, a nine-stamp block celebrating ten years of the Belgian Comic Strip Center was issued, with the center stamp a photo of Tintin\\'s famous Moon rocket that dominates the Comic Strip Center\\'s entry hall.[137]\\nTo mark the end of the Belgian Franc and to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the publication of Tintin in the Congo, two more stamps were issued by Belgian Post on 31 December 2001: Tintin in a pith helmet and a souvenir sheet with a single stamp in the center. The stamps were jointly issued in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[137]\\nIn 2004, Belgian Post celebrated its own seventy-fifth anniversary, as well as the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Explorers on the Moon, and the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Moon landings with a souvenir sheet of five stamps based upon the Explorers on the Moon adventure.[139]\\nTo celebrate the centenary of Hergé\\'s birth in 2007,[1] Belgian Post issued a sheet of 25 stamps depicting the album covers of all 24 Adventures of Tintin (in 24 languages) plus Hergé\\'s portrait in the center.[137]\\nA souvenir sheet of ten stamps called \"Tintin on screen\", issued 30 August 2011, depicts the Tintin film and television adaptations.[i][137]\\n Tintin has also been commemorated by coin several times.\\nIn 1995, the Monnaie de Paris (Paris Mint) issued a set of twelve gold medallions, available in a limited edition of 5000.[140]\\nA silver medallion was minted in 2004 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Tintin book Explorers on the Moon, again in a limited run, this time of 10,000. It quickly sold out.[141]\\nIn 2004, Belgium minted a limited edition commemorative euro coin featuring Tintin and Snowy celebrating the 75th anniversary of Tintin\\'s first adventure in January 2004.[142] Although it has a face value of €10, it is, as with other commemorative euro coins, legal tender only in the country in which it was issued—in this case, Belgium.[142]\\nIn 2006–2012 France issued the Comic Strip Heroes commemorative coin series featuring famous Franco-Belgian comics, beginning in 2006 with Tintin.[143]\\nIt was a set of six different euro coins honouring Hergé: three 1½-euro silver coins featuring Tintin and the Professor, Tintin and Captain Haddock, and Tintin and Chang; a €10 (gold) featuring Tintin; and a €20 (silver) and a €50 (gold) featuring Tintin and Snowy.[143] In 2007, on Hergé\\'s centenary, Belgium issued its €20 (silver) Hergé/Tintin coin.[144]\\n During Hergé\\'s lifetime, parodies were produced of the Adventures of Tintin, with one of the earliest appearing in Belgian newspaper La Patrie after the liberation of the country from Nazi German occupation in September 1944. Entitled Tintin au pays de nazis (\"Tintin in the Land of the Nazis\"), the short and crudely drawn strip lampoons Hergé for working for a Nazi-run newspaper during the occupation.[146]\\n Following Hergé\\'s death, hundreds more unofficial parodies and pastiches of the Adventures of Tintin were produced, covering a wide variety of different genres.[145] Tom McCarthy divided such works into three specific groupings: pornographic, political, and artistic.[147] In a number of cases, the actual name \"Tintin\" is replaced by something similar, like Nitnit, Timtim, or Quinquin, within these books.[145]\\n McCarthy\\'s first group, pornographic parodies, includes 1976\\'s Tintin en Suisse (\"Tintin in Switzerland\") and Jan Bucquoy\\'s 1992 work La Vie Sexuelle de Tintin (\"Tintin\\'s Sex Life\"), featuring Tintin and the other characters engaged in sexual acts.[148] Another such example was Tintin in Thailand, in which Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus travel to the East Asian country for a sex holiday. The book began circulating in December 1999, but in 2001, Belgian police arrested those responsible and confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation.[149]\\n Other parodies have been produced for political reasons: for instance, Tintin in Iraq lampoons the world politics of the early 21st century, with Hergé\\'s character General Alcazar representing President of the United States George W. Bush.[145] Written by the pseudonymous Jack Daniels, Breaking Free (1989) is a revolutionary socialist comic set in Britain during the 1980s, with Tintin and his uncle (modelled after Captain Haddock) being working class Englishmen who turn to socialism in order to oppose the capitalist policies of the Conservative Party government of Margaret Thatcher. When first published in Britain, it caused an outrage in the mainstream press, with one paper issuing the headline that \"Commie nutters turn Tintin into picket yob!\"[145]\\n Other comic creators have chosen to create artistic stories that are more like fan fiction than parody. The Swiss artist Exem created the irreverent comic adventures of Zinzin, what The Guardian calls \"the most beautifully produced of the pastiches.\"[145] Similarly, Canadian cartoonist Yves Rodier has produced a number of Tintin works, none of which have been authorised by the Hergé Foundation, including a 1986 \"completion\" of the unfinished Tintin and Alph-art, which he drew in Hergé\\'s ligne claire style.[145]\\n The response to these parodies has been mixed in the Tintinological community. Many despise them, seeing them as an affront to Hergé\\'s work.[145] Nick Rodwell of the Hergé Foundation took this view, declaring that \"none of these copyists count as true fans of Hergé. If they were, they would respect his wishes that no one but him draw Tintin\\'s adventures\".[145] Where possible, the foundation has taken legal action against those known to be producing such items. Others have taken a different attitude, considering such parodies and pastiches to be tributes to Hergé, and collecting them has become a \"niche specialty\".[145]\\n After Hergé\\'s death in 1983, his art began to be honoured at exhibitions around the world, keeping Tintin awareness at a high level.\\nThe first major Tintin exhibition in London was Tintin: 60 years of Adventure, held in 1989 at the Town Hall in Chelsea. This early exhibition displayed many of Hergé\\'s original sketches and inks, as well as some original gouaches.[151]\\nIn 2001, an exhibition entitled Mille Sabords! (\"Billions of Blistering Barnacles!\") was shown at the Musée national de la Marine in Paris.[152]\\nIn 2002, the Bunkamura Museum of Art in Tokyo staged an exhibition of original Hergé drawings as well as of the submarine and rocket ship invented in the strips by Professor Calculus.[153]\\nThe National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, hosted the exhibition The Adventures of Tintin at Sea in 2004, focusing on Tintin\\'s sea exploits, and in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the publication of Tintin\\'s first adventure.[154]\\n2004 also saw an exhibition in Halles Saint Géry in Brussels titled Tintin et la ville (\"Tintin and the City\") showcasing all cities in the world Tintin had travelled.[155]\\n The Belgian Comic Strip Center in the Brussels business district added exhibits dedicated to Hergé in 2004.[156]\\nThe Brussels\\' Comic Book Route in the center of Brussels added its first Tintin mural in July 2005.[157]\\n The centenary of Hergé\\'s birth in 2007[1] was commemorated at the largest museum for modern art in Europe, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, with Hergé, an art exhibition honouring his work. The exhibition, which ran from 20 December 2006 until 19 February 2007, featured some 300 of Hergé\\'s boards and original drawings, including all 124 original plates of The Blue Lotus.[150]\\nLaurent le Bon, organiser of the exhibit said: \"It was important for the Centre to show the work of Hergé next to that of Matisse or Picasso\".[158] Michael Farr claimed: \"Hergé has long been seen as a father figure in the comics world. If he\\'s now recognised as a modern artist, that\\'s very important\".[159]\\n 2009 saw the opening of the Hergé Museum (Musée Hergé), designed in contemporary style, in the town of Louvain-la-Neuve, south of Brussels.[160] Visitors follow a sequence of eight permanent exhibit rooms covering the entire range of Hergé\\'s work, showcasing the world of Tintin and his other creations.[161] In addition, the new museum has already seen many temporary exhibits, including Into Tibet With Tintin.[162]\\n Hergé is recognised as one of the leading cartoonists of the twentieth century.[164] Most notably, Hergé\\'s ligne claire style has been influential to creators of other Franco-Belgian comics. Contributors to Tintin magazine have employed ligne claire, and later artists Jacques Tardi, Yves Chaland, Jason Little, Phil Elliott, Martin Handford, Geof Darrow, Eric Heuvel, Garen Ewing, Joost Swarte, and others have produced works using it.[165]\\n In the wider art world, both Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein have claimed Hergé as one of their most important influences.[166] Lichtenstein made paintings based on fragments from Tintin comics, whilst Warhol used ligne claire and even made a series of paintings with Hergé as the subject. Warhol, who admired Tintin\\'s \"great political and satirical dimensions\",[166] said, \"Hergé has influenced my work in the same way as Walt Disney. For me, Hergé was more than a comic strip artist\".[167]\\n Hergé has been lauded as \"creating in art a powerful graphic record of the 20th century\\'s tortured history\" through his work on Tintin,[117] whilst Maurice Horn\\'s World Encyclopedia of Comics declares him to have \"spear-headed the post-World War II renaissance of European comic art\".[168] French philosopher Michel Serres noted that the twenty-three completed Tintin albums constituted a \"chef-d\\'oeuvre\" (\"masterpiece\") to which \"the work of no French novelist is comparable in importance or greatness\".[169]\\n In 1966, Charles de Gaulle said: \"Basically, you know, my only international rival is Tintin! We are the little ones who don\\'t let themselves be fooled by the big ones\".[170][j]\\n In March 2015, Brussels Airlines painted an Airbus A320-200 with registration OO-SNB in a special Tintin livery.[171]\\n Tintin has become a symbol of Belgium and so was used in a variety of visual responses to the 2016 Brussels bombings.[172]\\n In 2024, the Royal Belgian Football Association unveiled a Tintin-inspired kit for the Belgian national football team. The light blue and brown kit was used for the team\\'s away fixtures in the UEFA Euro 2024.[173]\\n The following are the twenty-four canonical Tintin comic albums, with their English titles. Publication dates are for the original French-language versions.\\n The following are double albums with a continuing story arc:\\n Hergé attempted and then abandoned Le Thermozéro (1958). Outside the Tintin series, a 48-page comic album supervised (but not written) by Hergé, Tintin and the Lake of Sharks, was released in 1972; it was based on the film Tintin et le lac aux requins.\\n Books\\n News articles\\n Journal articles\\n Websites\\n Books\\n Journal articles\\n News Articles', 'Asterix (Astérix or Astérix le Gaulois [asteʁiks lə ɡolwa], \"Asterix the Gaul\") (also known as Asterix and Obelix in some adaptations or The Adventures of Asterix) is a French comic album series about a Gaulish village which, thanks to a magic potion that enhances strength, resists the forces of Julius Caesar in an ahistorical telling of the time after the Gallic Wars.  Many adventures take the titular hero Asterix and his friend Obelix to Rome and beyond.\\n The series first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comic magazine Pilote on 29 October 1959. It was written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo until Goscinny\\'s death in 1977. Uderzo then took over the writing until 2009, when he sold the rights to publishing company Hachette; he died in 2020. In 2013, a new team consisting of Jean-Yves Ferri (script) and Didier Conrad (artwork) took over. As of 2023[update], 40 volumes have been released; the most recent was penned by new writer Fabcaro and released on 26 October 2023.\\n By that year, the volumes in total had sold 393 million copies,[1] making them the best-selling European comic book series, and the second best-selling comic book series in history after One Piece.\\n \\nAsterix comics usually start with the following introduction:   The year is 50 BC. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, not entirely... One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders. And life is not easy for the Roman legionaries who garrison the fortified camps of Totorum, Aquarium, Laudanum and Compendium...[2][3] The series follows the adventures of a village of Gauls as they resist Roman occupation in 50 BC. They do so using a magic potion, brewed by their druid Getafix (Panoramix in the French version), which temporarily gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonists, the title character Asterix and his friend Obelix, have various adventures. The \"-ix\" ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish \"-ix\" names in the series) alludes to the \"-rix\" suffix (meaning \"king\", like \"-rex\" in Latin) present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as Vercingetorix, Orgetorix, and Dumnorix.\\n In some of the stories, they travel to foreign countries, whilst other tales are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternate, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.\\n The Asterix series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into 111 languages and dialects as of 2009[update].[4]\\n The success of the series has led to the adaptation of its books into 15 films: ten animated, and five live action (two of which, Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra and Asterix and Obelix vs. Caesar, were major box office successes in France). There have also been a number of games based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris, Parc Astérix. The very first French satellite, Astérix, launched in 1965, was named after the character, whose name is close to Greek ἀστήρ and Latin astrum, meaning a \"star\". As of 20 April 2022, 385\\xa0million copies of Asterix books had been sold worldwide and translated in 111 languages making it the world\\'s most widely translated comic book series,[5] with co-creators René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo being France\\'s best-selling authors abroad.[6][7]\\n In April 2022, Albert and René\\'s general director, Céleste Surugue, hosted a 45-minute talk entitled \\'The Next Incarnation of a Heritage Franchise: Asterix\\' and spoke about the success of the Asterix franchise, of which he noted \"The idea was to find a subject with a strong connection with French culture and, while looking at the country\\'s history, they ended up choosing its first defeat, namely the Gaul\\'s Roman colonisation\". He also went on to say how, since 1989, Parc Asterix has attracted an average of 2.3 million visitors per year. Other notable mentions were how the franchise includes 10 animated movies, which recorded over 53 million viewers worldwide. The inception of Studios Idéfix in 1974 and the opening of Studio 58 in 2016 were among the necessary steps to make Asterix a \"100% Gaulish production\", considered the best solution to keep the creative process under control from start to finish and to employ French manpower. He also noted how a new album is now published every two years, with print figures of 5 million and an estimated readership of 20 million.[5]\\n Prior to creating the Asterix series, Goscinny and Uderzo had had success with their series Oumpah-pah, which was published in Tintin magazine.[9]\\nAstérix was originally serialised in Pilote magazine, debuting in the first issue on 29 October 1959.[10] In 1961, the first book was put together, titled Asterix the Gaul. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000. In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000. A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966\\'s Asterix and the Big Fight sold 400,000 upon initial publication. The ninth Asterix volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days.\\n Uderzo\\'s first preliminary sketches portrayed Asterix as a huge and strong traditional Gaulish warrior. But Goscinny had a different picture in his mind, visualizing Asterix as a shrewd, compact warrior who would possess intelligence and wit more than raw strength. However, Uderzo felt that the downsized hero needed a strong but dim companion, to which Goscinny agreed. Hence, Obelix was born.[11] Despite the growing popularity of Asterix with the readers, the financial backing for the publication Pilote ceased. Pilote was taken over by Georges Dargaud.[11]\\n When Goscinny died in 1977, Uderzo continued the series by popular demand of the readers, who implored him to continue. He continued to issue new volumes of the series, but on a less frequent basis. Many critics and fans of the series prefer the earlier collaborations with Goscinny.[12] Uderzo created his own publishing company, Éditions Albert René, which published every album drawn and written by Uderzo alone since then.[11] However, Dargaud, the initial publisher of the series, kept the publishing rights on the 24 first albums made by both Uderzo and Goscinny. In 1990, the Uderzo and Goscinny families decided to sue Dargaud to take over the rights. In 1998, after a long trial, Dargaud lost the rights to publish and sell the albums. Uderzo decided to sell these rights to Hachette instead of Albert-René, but the publishing rights on new albums were still owned by Albert Uderzo (40%), Sylvie Uderzo (20%) and Anne Goscinny (40%).[citation needed]\\n In December 2008, Uderzo sold his stake to Hachette, which took over the company.[13] In a letter published in the French newspaper Le Monde in 2009, Uderzo\\'s daughter, Sylvie, attacked her father\\'s decision to sell the family publishing firm and the rights to produce new Astérix adventures after his death. She said:\\n ... the co-creator of Astérix, France\\'s comic strip hero, has betrayed the Gaulish warrior to the modern-day Romans – the men of industry and finance.[14][15] However, René Goscinny\\'s daughter, Anne, also gave her agreement to the continuation of the series and sold her rights at the same time. She is reported to have said that \"Asterix has already had two lives: one during my father\\'s lifetime and one after it. Why not a third?\".[16] A few months later, Uderzo appointed three illustrators, who had been his assistants for many years, to continue the series.[12] In 2011, Uderzo announced that a new Asterix album was due out in 2013, with Jean-Yves Ferri writing the story and Frédéric Mébarki drawing it.[17] A year later, in 2012, the publisher Albert-René announced that Frédéric Mébarki had withdrawn from drawing the new album, due to the pressure he felt in following in the steps of Uderzo. Comic artist Didier Conrad was officially announced to take over drawing duties from Mébarki, with the due date of the new album in 2013 unchanged.[18][19]\\n In January 2015, after the murders of seven cartoonists at the satirical Paris weekly Charlie Hebdo, Astérix creator Albert Uderzo came out of retirement to draw two Astérix pictures honouring the memories of the victims.[20]\\n Numbers 1–24, 32 and 34 are by Goscinny and Uderzo. Numbers 25–31 and 33 are by Uderzo alone. Numbers 35–39 are by Jean-Yves Ferri and Didier Conrad. Years stated are for their initial album release.[21]\\n Asterix Conquers Rome is a comics adaptation of the animated film The Twelve Tasks of Asterix. It was released in 1976 and was the 23rd volume to be published, but it has been rarely reprinted and is not considered to be canonical to the series. The only English translations ever to be published were in the Asterix Annual 1980 and never an English standalone volume. A picture-book version of the same story was published in English translation as The Twelve Tasks of Asterix by Hodder & Stoughton in 1978.\\n In 1996, a tribute album in honour of Albert Uderzo was released titled Uderzo Croqué par ses Amis, a volume containing 21 short stories with Uderzo in Ancient Gaul. This volume was published by Soleil Productions and has not been translated into English.\\n In 2007, Éditions Albert René released a tribute volume titled Astérix et ses Amis, a 60-page volume of one-to-four-page short stories. It was a tribute to Albert Uderzo on his 80th birthday by 34 European cartoonists. The volume was translated into nine languages. As of 2016[update], it has not been translated into English.[65]\\n In 2016, the French publisher Hachette, along with Anne Goscinny and Albert Uderzo decided to make the special issue album The XII Tasks of Asterix for the 40th anniversary of the film The Twelve Tasks of Asterix. There was no English edition.\\n \\nThe main setting for the series is an unnamed coastal village, rumoured to be inspired by Erquy[66] in Armorica (present-day Brittany), a province of Gaul (modern France), in the year 50 BC. Julius Caesar has conquered nearly all of Gaul for the Roman Empire during the Gallic Wars. The little Armorican village, however, has held out because the villagers can gain temporary superhuman strength by drinking a magic potion brewed by the local village druid, Getafix. His chief is Vitalstatistix.\\n The main protagonist and hero of the village is Asterix, who, because of his shrewdness, is usually entrusted with the most important affairs of the village. He is aided in his adventures by his rather corpulent and slower thinking friend, Obelix, who, because he fell into the druid\\'s cauldron of the potion as a baby, has permanent superhuman strength (because of this, Getafix steadfastly refuses to allow Obelix to drink the potion, as doing so would have a dangerous and unpredictable result, as shown in Asterix and Obelix All at Sea). Obelix is usually accompanied by Dogmatix, his little dog. (Except for Asterix and Obelix, the names of the characters change with the language. For example, Obelix\\'s dog\\'s name is \"Idéfix\" in the original French edition.)\\n Asterix and Obelix (and sometimes other members of the village) go on various adventures both within the village and in far away lands. Places visited in the series include parts of Gaul (Lutetia, Corsica etc.), neighbouring nations (Belgium, Spain, Britain, Germany etc.), and far away lands (North America, Middle East, India etc.).\\n The series employs science-fiction and fantasy elements in the more recent books; for instance, the use of extraterrestrials in Asterix and the Falling Sky and the city of Atlantis in Asterix and Obelix All at Sea.\\n With rare exceptions, the ending of the albums usually shows a big banquet with the village\\'s inhabitants gathering – the sole exception is the bard Cacofonix restrained and gagged to prevent him from singing (but in Asterix and the Normans the blacksmith Fulliautomatix was tied up). Mostly the banquets are held under the starry nights in the village, where roast boar is devoured and all (but one) are set about in merrymaking. However, there are a few exceptions, such as in Asterix and Cleopatra.\\n The humour encountered in the Asterix comics often centers around puns, caricatures, and tongue-in-cheek stereotypes of contemporary European nations and French regions. Much of the multi-layered humour in the initial Asterix books was French-specific, which delayed the translation of the books into other languages for fear of losing the jokes and the spirit of the story. Some translations have actually added local humour: In the Italian translation, the Roman legionaries are made to speak in 20th-century Roman dialect, and Obelix\\'s famous Ils sont fous, ces Romains (\"These Romans are crazy\") is translated properly as Sono pazzi questi romani, humorously alluding to the Roman abbreviation SPQR. In another example: Hiccups are written onomatopoeically in French as hips, but in English as \"hic\", allowing Roman legionaries in more than one of the English translations to decline their hiccups absurdly in Latin (hic, haec, hoc). The newer albums share a more universal humour, both written and visual.[67]\\n All the fictional characters in Asterix have names which are puns on their roles or personalities, and which follow certain patterns specific to nationality. Certain rules are followed (most of the time) such as Gauls (and their neighbours) having an \"-ix\" suffix for the men and ending in \"-a\" for the women; for example, Chief Vitalstatistix (so called due to his portly stature) and his wife Impedimenta (often at odds with the chief). The male Roman names end in \"-us\", echoing Latin nominative male singular form, as in Gluteus Maximus, a muscle-bound athlete whose name is literally the butt of the joke. Gothic names (present-day Germany) end in \"-ic\", after Gothic chiefs such as Alaric and Theoderic; for example Rhetoric the interpreter. Greek names end in \"-os\" or \"-es\"; for example, Thermos the restaurateur. British names usually end in \"-ax\" or \"-os\" and are often puns on the taxation associated with the later United Kingdom; examples include Mykingdomforanos, a British tribal chieftain, Valuaddedtax the druid, and Selectivemploymentax the mercenary. Names of Normans end with \"-af\", for example Nescaf or Cenotaf. Egyptian characters often end in -is, such as the architects Edifis and Artifis, and the scribe Exlibris. Indic names, apart from the only Indic female characters Orinjade and Lemuhnade, exhibit considerable variation; examples include Watziznehm, Watzit, Owzat, and Howdoo. Other nationalities are treated to pidgin translations from their language, like Huevos y Bacon, a Spanish chieftain (whose name, meaning eggs and bacon, is often guidebook Spanish for tourists), or literary and other popular media references, like Dubbelosix (a sly reference to James Bond\\'s codename \"007\").[68]\\n Most of these jokes, and hence the names of the characters, are specific to the translation; for example, the druid named Getafix in English translation – \"get a fix\", referring to the character\\'s role in dispensing the magic potion – is Panoramix in the original French and Miraculix in German.[69] Even so, occasionally the wordplay has been preserved: Obelix\\'s dog, known in the original French as Idéfix (from idée fixe, a \"fixed idea\" or obsession), is called Dogmatix in English, which not only renders the original meaning strikingly closely (\"dogmatic\") but in fact adds another layer of wordplay with the syllable \"Dog-\" at the beginning of the name.\\n The name Asterix, French Astérix, comes from astérisque, meaning \"asterisk\", which is the typographical symbol * indicating a footnote, from the Greek word ἀστήρ (aster), meaning a \"star\". His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local alphabets. For example, in Esperanto, Polish, Slovene, Latvian, and Turkish it is Asteriks (in Turkish he was first named Bücür meaning \"shorty\", but the name was then standardised). Two exceptions include Icelandic, in which he is known as Ástríkur (\"Rich of love\"), and Sinhala, where he is known as සූර පප්පා (Soora Pappa), which can be interpreted as \"Hero\". The name Obelix (Obélix) may refer to \"obelisk\", a stone column from ancient Egypt (and hence his large size and strength and his task of carrying around menhirs), but also to another typographical symbol, the obelisk or obelus (†).\\n For explanations of some of the other names, see List of Asterix characters.\\n Many of the Asterix adventures take place in other countries away from their homeland in Gaul. In every album that takes place abroad, the characters meet (usually modern-day) stereotypes for each country, as seen by the French.[70]\\n When the Gauls see foreigners speaking their foreign languages, these have different representations in the cartoon speech bubbles:\\n The various volumes have been translated into more than 120 languages and dialects. Besides the original French language, most albums are available in Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Latvian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Ukrainian.[71][72]\\n Some books have also been translated into languages including Esperanto, Scottish Gaelic, Irish, Scots, Indonesian, Hindi, Persian, Bengali, Afrikaans, Arabic, Frisian, Romansch, Thai, Vietnamese, Welsh, Sinhala, Ancient Greek, and Luxembourgish.[71]\\n In Europe, several volumes were translated into a variety of regional languages and dialects, such as Alsatian, Breton, Chtimi (Picard), and Corsican in France; Bavarian, Swabian, and Low German in Germany; and Savo, Karelia, Rauma, and Helsinki slang dialects in Finland. In Portugal a special edition of the first volume, Asterix the Gaul, was translated into local language Mirandese.[73] In Greece, a number of volumes have appeared in the Cretan Greek, Cypriot Greek, and Pontic Greek dialects.[74] In the Italian version, while the Gauls speak standard Italian, the legionaries speak in the Romanesque dialect. In the former Yugoslavia, the \"Forum\" publishing house translated Corsican text in Asterix in Corsica into the Montenegrin dialect of Serbo-Croatian (today called Montenegrin).\\n In the Netherlands, several volumes were translated into West Frisian, a Germanic language spoken in the province of Friesland; into Limburgish, a regional language spoken not only in Dutch Limburg but also in Belgian Limburg and North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany; and into Tweants, a dialect in the region of Twente in the eastern province of Overijssel. Hungarian-language books were published in the former Yugoslavia for the Hungarian minority living in Serbia. Although not translated into a fully autonomous dialect, the books differ slightly from the language of the books issued in Hungary. In Sri Lanka, the cartoon series was adapted into Sinhala as Sura Pappa.[73]\\n Most volumes have been translated into Latin and Ancient Greek, with accompanying teachers\\' guides, as a way of teaching these ancient languages.\\n Before Asterix became famous, translations of some strips were published in British comics including Valiant, Ranger, and Look & Learn, under names Little Fred and Big Ed[75] and Beric the Bold, set in Roman-occupied Britain. These were included in an exhibition on Goscinny\\'s life and career, and Asterix, in London\\'s Jewish Museum in 2018.[76][77]\\n In 1970, William Morrow and Company published English translations in hardback of three Asterix albums for the American market. These were Asterix the Gaul, Asterix and Cleopatra and Asterix the Legionary. Lawrence Hughes in a letter to The New York Times  stated, \"Sales were modest, with the third title selling half the number of the first. I was publisher at the time, and Bill Cosby tried to buy film and television rights. When that fell through, we gave up the series.\"[78]\\n The first 33 Asterix albums were translated into English by Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge (including the three volumes reprinted by William Morrow),[79] who were widely praised for maintaining the spirit and humour of the original French versions. Hockridge died in 2013, so Bell translated books 34 to 36 by herself, before retiring in 2016 for health reasons. She died in 2018.[80] Adriana Hunter became translator.\\n US publisher Papercutz in December 2019 announced it would begin publishing \"all-new more American translations\" of the Asterix books, starting on 19 May 2020.[81] The launch was postponed to 15 July 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[82] The new translator is Joe Johnson, a professor of French and Spanish at Clayton State University.[83]\\n The series has been adapted into various media. There are 18 films, 15 board games, 40 video games, and 1 theme park.\\n On 17 November 2018, a 52 eleven-minute episode animated series featuring Dogmatix (Idéfix in the French version) was announced to be in production by Studio 58 and Futurikon for broadcast on France Télévisions in 2020.[86] On 21 December 2020, it was confirmed that Dogmatix and the Indomitables had been pushed back to fall 2021, with o2o Studio producing the animation.[87][88] The show is distributed globally by LS Distribution.[89] The series premiered on the Okoo streaming service on 2 July before beginning its linear broadcast on France 4 on 28 August 2021.[90]\\n On 3 March 2021, it was announced that Asterix the Gaul is to star in a new Netflix animated series directed by Alain Chabat. The series will be adapted from one of the classic volumes, Asterix and the Big Fight, where the Romans, after being constantly embarrassed by Asterix and his village cohorts, organize a brawl between rival Gaulish chiefs and try to fix the result by kidnapping a druid along with his much-needed magic potion.[91] The series, originally scheduled for 2023,[92][93] will debut in 2025, and will be CG-animated.[94]\\n Many gamebooks, board games and video games are based upon the Asterix series. In particular, many video games were released by various computer game publishers.\\n Parc Astérix, a theme park 22 miles north of Paris, based upon the series, was opened in 1989. It is one of the most visited sites in France, with around 2.3\\xa0million visitors per year.', 'The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). An adaptation of L. Frank Baum\\'s 1900 children\\'s fantasy novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, it was primarily directed by Victor Fleming, who left production to take over the troubled Gone with the Wind. It  stars Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, while others made uncredited contributions. The music was composed by Harold Arlen and adapted by Herbert Stothart, with lyrics by Edgar \"Yip\" Harburg.\\n The Wizard of Oz is celebrated for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, and memorable characters.[5] It was a critical success and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning Best Original Song for \"Over the Rainbow\" and Best Original Score for Stothart; an Academy Juvenile Award was presented to Judy Garland.[6] While the film was sufficiently popular at the box office, it failed to make a profit for MGM until its 1949 re-release, earning only $3 million on a $2.7 million budget, making it MGM\\'s most expensive production at the time.[3][7][8]\\n The 1956 television broadcast premiere of the film on CBS reintroduced the film to the public. According to the U.S. Library of Congress, it is the most seen film in movie history.[9][10] In 1989, it was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\";[11][12] it is also one of the few films on UNESCO\\'s Memory of the World Register.[13] The film was ranked second in Variety\\'s inaugural 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list published in 2022.[14] It was among the top ten in the 2005 BFI (British Film Institute) list of \"50 films to be seen by the age of 14\" and is on the BFI\\'s updated list of \"50 films to be seen by the age of 15\" released in May 2020.[15] The Wizard of Oz has become the source of many quotes referenced in contemporary popular culture. The film frequently ranks on critics\\' lists of the greatest films of all time and is the most commercially successful adaptation of Baum\\'s work.[9][16]\\n In rural Kansas, Dorothy Gale lives on a farm owned by her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em. Dorothy\\'s neighbor, Almira Gulch, who had been bitten by Dorothy\\'s dog, Toto, obtains a sheriff\\'s order authorizing her to seize Toto. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who runs away to protect him. Professor Marvel, a charlatan fortune-teller, persuades Dorothy to go home because Aunt Em is heartbroken. She returns just as a tornado approaches the farm. Unable to get into the locked storm cellar, Dorothy takes cover in the farmhouse and is knocked unconscious as the tornado lifts the house and drops it intact onto an unknown land.\\n Dorothy awakens and is greeted by a good witch named Glinda, who floats down in a bubble and explains that Dorothy has landed in Munchkinland in the Land of Oz, and that the Munchkins are celebrating because the house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, suddenly appears. Before she can seize her deceased sister\\'s ruby slippers, Glinda magically transports them onto Dorothy\\'s feet and tells her to keep them on. Because the Wicked Witch has no power in Munchkinland, she leaves, but swears vengeance upon Dorothy and Toto. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, the home of the Wizard of Oz, as he might know how to help her return home as the bubble makes her vanish and float away.\\n Along the way, Dorothy meets the Scarecrow, who wants a brain; the Tin Man, who wants a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who wants courage. The group reaches the Emerald City, despite the efforts of the Wicked Witch. Dorothy is initially denied an audience with the Wizard by his guard, but the guard relents due to Dorothy\\'s grief, and the four are led into the Wizard\\'s chambers. The Wizard appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch\\'s broomstick.\\n During their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by flying monkeys and taken to the Wicked Witch, but the ruby slippers protect her and Toto manages to escape, leading the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion to the castle. They free Dorothy, but are pursued and finally cornered by the Witch and her guards. The Witch taunts them and sets fire to the Scarecrow\\'s arm. When Dorothy throws a bucket of water onto the Scarecrow, she inadvertently splashes the Witch, causing her to melt away.\\n The Witch\\'s guards gratefully give Dorothy her broomstick, and the four return to the Wizard, but he tells them to return tomorrow. When Toto pulls back a curtain, the \"Wizard\" is revealed to be an ordinary man operating machinery that projects a ghostly image of his face. The four travelers confront the Wizard, who insists he is a good man at heart, but confesses to being a humbug. He then \"grants\" the wishes of Dorothy\\'s three friends by giving them tokens to confirm that they have the qualities they sought.\\n The Wizard reveals that he, like Dorothy, is from Kansas and accidentally arrived in Oz in a hot air balloon. When he offers to take Dorothy back to Kansas with him aboard his balloon, she accepts, but Toto jumps off and Dorothy goes after him, and the balloon accidentally lifts off with just the Wizard aboard. Glinda reappears and tells Dorothy she always had the power to return to Kansas using the ruby slippers, but had to find that out for herself. After sharing a tearful farewell with her friends, Dorothy heeds Glinda\\'s instructions by tapping her heels three times and repeating, \"There\\'s no place like home.\"\\n Dorothy is transported back to Kansas, where she awakens in her own bed. Aunt Em attends to her while Uncle Henry and the farm hands stand by. Professor Marvel stops in as Dorothy describes Oz, telling the farm hands and the Professor they were there too, and they smile, humoring her. As Dorothy hugs Toto, she gratefully exclaims, \"Oh, Auntie Em, there\\'s no place like home!\"\\n In the film\\'s end credits, whenever a Kansas character has a counterpart in Oz, only the Kansas character is listed. For example, Frank Morgan is listed as playing Professor Marvel, but not the Wizard of Oz. The only Oz characters listed in the credits are Glinda and the Munchkins.\\n Uncredited\\n Production on the film began when Walt Disney\\'s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) showed that films adapted from popular children\\'s stories and fairytales could be successful.[21][22] In January 1938, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the rights to L. Frank Baum\\'s popular novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz from Samuel Goldwyn. Goldwyn had considered making the film as a vehicle for Eddie Cantor, who was under contract to Samuel Goldwyn Productions and whom Goldwyn wanted to cast as the Scarecrow.[22]\\n The script went through several writers and revisions.[23] Mervyn LeRoy\\'s assistant, William H. Cannon, had submitted a brief four-page outline.[23] Because recent fantasy films had not fared well, he recommended toning down or removing the magical elements. In his outline, the Scarecrow was a man so stupid that the only employment open to him was scaring crows from cornfields, and the Tin Woodman was a criminal so heartless that he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity. This torture softened him into somebody gentler and kinder.[23] Cannon\\'s vision was similar to Larry Semon\\'s 1925 film adaptation, in which the magical elements are absent.\\n Afterward, LeRoy hired screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who delivered a 17-page draft of the Kansas scenes. A few weeks later, Mankiewicz delivered a further 56 pages. LeRoy also hired Noel Langley and poet Ogden Nash to write separate versions of the story. None of these three knew about the others, and this was not an uncommon procedure. Nash delivered a four-page outline; Langley turned in a 43-page treatment and a full film script. Langley then turned in three more scripts, this time incorporating the songs written by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg. Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf submitted a script and were brought on board to touch up the writing. They were asked to ensure that the story stayed true to Baum\\'s book. However, producer Arthur Freed was unhappy with their work and reassigned it to Langley.[24] During filming, Victor Fleming and John Lee Mahin revised the script further, adding and cutting some scenes. Haley and Lahr are also known to have written some of their dialogue for the Kansas sequence.\\n They completed the final draft of the script on October 8, 1938, following numerous rewrites.[25] Others who contributed to the adaptation without credit include Irving Brecher, Herbert Fields, Arthur Freed, Yip Harburg, Samuel Hoffenstein, Jack Mintz, Sid Silvers, Richard Thorpe, George Cukor and King Vidor. Only Langley, Ryerson, and Woolf were credited for the script.[22]\\n In addition, songwriter Harburg\\'s son (and biographer) Ernie Harburg reported:\\n So anyhow, Yip also wrote all the dialogue in that time and the setup to the songs and he also wrote the part where they give out the heart, the brains, and the nerve, because he was the final script editor. And he – there was eleven screenwriters on that – and he pulled the whole thing together, wrote his own lines and gave the thing a coherence and unity which made it a work of art. But he doesn\\'t get credit for that. He gets lyrics by E. Y. Harburg, you see. But nevertheless, he put his influence on the thing.[26]\\n The original producers thought that a 1939 audience was too sophisticated to accept Oz as a straight-ahead fantasy; therefore, it was reconceived as a lengthy, elaborate dream sequence. Because they perceived a need to attract a youthful audience by appealing to modern fads and styles, the score had featured a song called \"The Jitterbug\", and the script had featured a scene with a series of musical contests. A spoiled, selfish princess in Oz had outlawed all forms of music except classical music and operetta. The princess challenged Dorothy to a singing contest, in which Dorothy\\'s swing style enchanted listeners and won the grand prize. This part was initially written for Betty Jaynes,[27] but was later dropped.\\n Another scene, which was removed before final script approval and never filmed, was an epilogue scene in Kansas after Dorothy\\'s return. Hunk (the Kansan counterpart to the Scarecrow) is leaving for an agricultural college, and extracts a promise from Dorothy to write to him. The scene implies that romance will eventually develop between the two, which also may have been intended as an explanation for Dorothy\\'s partiality for the Scarecrow over her other two companions. This plot idea was never totally dropped, and is especially noticeable in the final script when Dorothy, just before she is to leave Oz, tells the Scarecrow, \"I think I\\'ll miss you most of all.\"[28]\\n Much attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others. It took the studio\\'s art department almost a week to settle on the shade of yellow used for the Yellow Brick Road.[29]\\n Several actresses were reportedly considered for the part of Dorothy, including Shirley Temple from 20th Century Fox, at the time, the most prominent child star; Deanna Durbin, a relative newcomer, with a recognized operatic voice; and Judy Garland, the most experienced of the three. Officially, the decision to cast Garland was attributed to contractual issues.\\n Ray Bolger was originally cast as the Tin Man and Buddy Ebsen was to play the Scarecrow.[25] Bolger, however, longed to play the Scarecrow, as his childhood idol Fred Stone had done on stage in 1902; with that very performance, Stone had inspired him to become a vaudevillian in the first place. Now unhappy with his role as the Tin Man (reportedly claiming, \"I\\'m not a tin performer; I\\'m fluid\"), Bolger convinced producer Mervyn LeRoy to recast him in the part he so desired.[30] Ebsen did not object; after going over the basics of the Scarecrow\\'s distinctive gait with Bolger (as a professional dancer, Ebsen had been cast because the studio was confident he would be up to the task of replicating the famous \"wobbly-walk\" of Stone\\'s Scarecrow), he recorded all of his songs, went through all the rehearsals as the Tin Man and began filming with the rest of the cast.[31]\\n W. C. Fields was originally chosen for the title role of the Wizard (after Ed Wynn turned it down, considering the part \"too small\"), but the studio could not meet Fields\\' fee.[32] Wallace Beery lobbied for the role, but the studio refused to spare him during the long shooting schedule. Instead, another contract player, Frank Morgan, was cast on September 22.\\n Veteran vaudeville performer Pat Walshe was best known for his performance as various monkeys in many theater productions and circus shows. He was cast as Nikko, the head Winged Monkey, on September 28, traveling to MGM studios on October 3.\\n An extensive talent search produced over a hundred little people to play Munchkins; this meant that most of the film\\'s Oz sequences would have to be shot before work on the Munchkinland sequence could begin. According to Munchkin actor Jerry Maren, the little people were each paid over $125 a week (equivalent to $2,700 today). Meinhardt Raabe, who played the coroner, revealed in the 1990 documentary The Making of the Wizard of Oz that the MGM costume and wardrobe department, under the direction of designer Adrian, had to design over 100 costumes for the Munchkin sequences. They photographed and cataloged each Munchkin in their costume so they could consistently apply the same costume and makeup each day of production.\\n Gale Sondergaard was originally cast as the Wicked Witch of the West, but withdrew from the role when the witch\\'s persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the Evil Queen in Disney\\'s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) to the familiar \"ugly hag\".[33] She was replaced on October 10, 1938, just three days before filming started, by MGM contract player Margaret Hamilton. Sondergaard said in an interview for a bonus feature on the DVD that she had no regrets about turning down the part. Sondergaard would go on to play a glamorous feline villainess in Fox\\'s version of Maurice Maeterlinck\\'s The Blue Bird in 1940.[34] Hamilton played a role remarkably similar to the Wicked Witch in the Judy Garland film Babes in Arms (1939).\\n According to Aljean Harmetz, the \"gone-to-seed\" coat worn by Morgan as the Wizard was selected from a rack of coats purchased from a second-hand shop. According to legend, Morgan later discovered a label in the coat indicating it had once belonged to Baum, that Baum\\'s widow confirmed this, and that the coat was eventually presented to her. But Baum biographer Michael Patrick Hearn says the Baum family denies ever seeing the coat or knowing of the story; Hamilton considered it a rumor concocted by the studio.[35]\\n The production faced the challenge of creating the Tin Man\\'s costume. Several tests were done to find the right makeup and clothes for Ebsen.[36] Ten days into the shoot, Ebsen suffered a toxic reaction after repeatedly inhaling the aluminum dust (which his daughter, Kiki Ebsen, has said the studio misrepresented as an \"allergic reaction\") in the aluminum powder makeup he wore, though he did recall taking a breath one night without suffering any immediate effects. He was hospitalized in critical condition and was subsequently forced to leave the project. In a later interview (included on the 2005 DVD release of The Wizard of Oz), he recalled that the studio heads appreciated the seriousness of his illness only after he was hospitalized. Filming halted while a replacement for him was sought.\\n No footage of Ebsen as the Tin Man has ever been released\\xa0– only photos taken during filming and makeup tests. His replacement, Jack Haley, assumed Ebsen had been fired.[37] The makeup used for Haley was quietly changed to an aluminum paste, with a layer of clown white greasepaint underneath, in order to protect his skin. Although it did not have the same dire effect on Haley, he did at one point suffer an eye infection from it. To keep down on production costs, Haley only rerecorded \"If I Only Had a Heart\" and solo lines during \"If I Only Had the Nerve\" and the scrapped song \"The Jitterbug\"; as such, Ebsen\\'s voice can still be heard in the remaining songs featuring the Tin Man in group vocals.\\n LeRoy, after reviewing the footage and feeling Thorpe was rushing the production, adversely affecting the actors\\' performances, had Thorpe replaced. During reorganization on the production, George Cukor temporarily took over under LeRoy\\'s guidance. Initially, the studio had made Garland wear a blonde wig and heavy \"baby-doll\" makeup, and she played Dorothy in an exaggerated fashion. Cukor changed Garland\\'s and Hamilton\\'s makeup and costumes, and told Garland to \"be herself\". This meant that all the scenes Garland and Hamilton had already completed had to be reshot. Cukor also suggested the studio cast Jack Haley, on loan from Fox, as the Tin Man.[38]\\n Cukor did not shoot any scenes for the film, but acted merely as a creative advisor to the troubled production. His prior commitment to direct Gone with the Wind required him to leave on November 3, 1938, when Victor Fleming assumed directorial responsibility. As director, Fleming chose not to shift the film from Cukor\\'s creative realignment, as producer LeRoy had already expressed his satisfaction with the film\\'s new course.\\n Production on the bulk of the Technicolor sequences was a long and exhausting process that ran for over six months, from October 1938 to March 1939. Most of the cast worked six days a week and had to arrive as early as 4\\xa0a.m. to be fitted with makeup and costumes, and often did not leave until 7 pm or later. Cumbersome makeup and costumes were made even more uncomfortable by the daylight-bright lighting the early Technicolor process required, which could heat the set to over 100\\xa0°F (38\\xa0°C), which also had the side effect of bringing the production\\'s electricity bill to a staggering estimate of $225,000 (equivalent to $4,928,469 in 2023).[39] Bolger later said that the frightening nature of the costumes prevented most of the Oz principals from eating in the studio commissary;[40] and the toxicity of Hamilton\\'s copper-based makeup forced her to eat a liquid diet on shoot days.[41] It took as many as twelve takes to have Toto run alongside the actors as they skipped down the Yellow Brick Road.\\n All the Oz sequences were filmed in three-strip Technicolor,[22][23] while the opening and closing credits, and the Kansas sequences, were filmed in black and white and colored in a sepia-tone process.[22] Sepia-tone film was also used in the scene where Aunt Em appears in the Wicked Witch\\'s crystal ball. The film was not the first to use Technicolor, which was introduced in The Gulf Between (1917) as a two-color additive process, nor the first to use the three-color subtractive Technicolor Process 4, which made its live-action debut during a sequence in The Cat and the Fiddle (1934).[42]\\n In Hamilton\\'s exit from Munchkinland, a concealed elevator was installed to lower her below stage level, as fire and smoke erupted to dramatize and conceal her exit. The first take ran well, but on the second take, the burst of fire came too soon. The flames set fire to her green, copper-based face paint, causing third-degree burns to her hands and face. She spent three months recuperating before returning to work.[43] Her green makeup had usually been removed with acetone due to its toxic copper content. Because of Hamilton\\'s burns, makeup artist Jack Young removed the makeup with alcohol to prevent infection.[44]\\n Since the film has been released, credible stories have come out indicating that Judy Garland endured extensive abuse during and before filming from various parties involved.[45][46][47][48] The studio went to extreme lengths to change her appearance, including binding her chest and giving her Benzedrine tablets to keep her weight down, along with uppers and downers that caused giggling fits. There were claims that various members of the cast pointed out her breasts and made other lewd comments. Victor Fleming slapped her during the Cowardly Lion\\'s introduction scene when Garland could not stop laughing at Lahr\\'s performance. Once the scene was done, Fleming, reportedly ashamed of himself, ordered the crew to punch him in the face. Garland, however, kissed him instead.[49][50] She was also forced to wear a cap on her teeth due to the fact some of her teeth were misaligned and also had to wear rubber discs on her nose to change its shape during filming.[51] Claims have been made in memoirs that the frequently drunk actors portraying the Munchkins propositioned and pinched her.[52][53][47][54] Garland said that she was groped by Louis B. Mayer.[45][55]\\n Arnold Gillespie, the film\\'s special effects director, employed several techniques.[36] Developing the tornado scene was especially costly. Gillespie used muslin cloth to make the tornado flexible, after a previous attempt with rubber failed. He hung the 35\\xa0ft (11\\xa0m) of muslin from a steel gantry and connected the bottom to a rod. By moving the gantry and rod, he was able to create the illusion of a tornado moving across the stage. Fuller\\'s earth was sprayed from both the top and bottom using compressed air hoses to complete the effect. Dorothy\\'s house was recreated using a model.[56] Stock footage of this tornado was later recycled for a climactic scene in the 1943 musical film Cabin in the Sky, directed by Judy Garland\\'s eventual second husband Vincente Minnelli.[57]\\n The Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow masks were made of foam latex makeup created by makeup artist Jack Dawn. Dawn was one of the first to use this technique.[58][59] It took an hour each day to slowly peel Bolger\\'s glued-on mask from his face, a process that eventually left permanent lines around his mouth and chin.[44][60]\\n The Tin Man\\'s costume was made of leather-covered buckram, and the oil used to grease his joints was made from chocolate syrup.[61] The Cowardly Lion\\'s costume was made from real lion skin and fur.[62] Due to the heavy makeup, Bert Lahr could only consume soup and milkshakes on break, which eventually made him sick. After a few months, Lahr put his foot down and requested normal meals along with makeup redos after lunch.[63][64] For the \"horse of a different color\" scene, Jell-O powder was used to color the white horses.[65] Asbestos was used to achieve some of the special effects, such as the witch\\'s burning broomstick and the fake snow that covers Dorothy as she sleeps in the field of poppies.[66][67]\\n The Wizard of Oz is famous for its musical selections and soundtrack. Its songs were composed by Harold Arlen, with lyrics by E. Y. \"Yip\" Harburg. They won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Over the Rainbow\". The song ranks first in the AFI\\'s 100 Years...100 Songs and the Recording Industry Association of America\\'s \"365 Songs of the Century\".\\n MGM composer Herbert Stothart, a well-known Hollywood composer and songwriter, won the Academy Award for Best Original Score.\\n Georgie Stoll was associate conductor, and screen credit was given to George Bassman, Murray Cutter, Ken Darby and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements. (As usual, Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an unbilled musical associate to Freed.)[citation needed]\\n The songs were recorded in the studio\\'s scoring stage before filming. Several of the recordings were completed while Ebsen was still with the cast. Although he had to be dropped from the cast because of a dangerous reaction to his aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained on the soundtrack (as mentioned in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). He can be heard in the group vocals of \"We\\'re Off to See the Wizard\".\\n Bolger\\'s original recording of \"If I Only Had a Brain\" was far more sedate than the version in the film. During filming, Cukor and LeRoy decided a more energetic rendition better suited Dorothy\\'s initial meeting with the Scarecrow, and it was rerecorded. The original version was considered lost until a copy was discovered in 2009.[68]\\n All lyrics are written by E. Y. Yip Harburg; all music is composed by Harold Arlen Some musical pieces were filmed and deleted later, in the editing process.\\n The song \"The Jitterbug\", written in a swing style, was intended for a sequence where the group journeys to the Witch\\'s castle. Owing to time constraints, it was cut from the final theatrical version. The film footage of the song has been lost, although silent home-film footage of rehearsals has survived. The audio recording of the song was preserved, and was included in the two-CD Rhino Records deluxe edition of the soundtrack, as well as on the film\\'s VHS and DVD editions. A reference to \"The Jitterbug\" remains in the film: The Witch tells her flying monkeys that they should have no trouble apprehending Dorothy and her friends because \"I\\'ve sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them.\"[69]\\n Another musical number cut before release came right after the Wicked Witch of the West was melted and before Dorothy and her friends returned to the Wizard. This was a reprise of \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" (blended with \"We\\'re Off to See the Wizard\" and \"The Merry Old Land of Oz\") with the lyrics altered to \"Hail! Hail! The witch is dead!\" This started with the Witch\\'s guard saying \"Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!\" and dissolved to a huge celebration by the citizens of the Emerald City, who sang the song as they accompanied Dorothy and her friends to the Wizard. Today, the film of this scene is also lost, and only a few stills survive, along with a few seconds of footage used on several reissue trailers. The entire audio track was preserved and is included on the two-CD Rhino Record \"deluxe\" soundtrack edition.[70]\\n Garland was to sing a brief reprise of \"Over the Rainbow\" while Dorothy was trapped in the Witch\\'s castle, but it was cut because it was considered too emotionally intense. Because Garland sung the reprise live on set, only the underscoring from the final edit survives. However, the on-set audio of the scene when it was originally filmed under Richard Thorpe still exists and was included as an extra in all home media releases from 1993 onward. The Deluxe Edition soundtrack marries the singing from the Thorpe take to the underscoring from the Fleming version to approximate what this would have sounded like.[71]\\n Extensive edits in the film\\'s final cut removed vocals from the last portion of the film. However, the film was fully underscored, with instrumental snippets from the film\\'s various leitmotifs throughout. There was also some recognizable classical and popular music, including:\\n (This list is excerpted from the liner notes of the Rhino Records collection.)\\n Principal photography concluded with the monochromatic Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939. When Victor Fleming was called away to replace George Cukor as director of Gone with the Wind, veteran director King Vidor agreed to direct Oz during its final ten days of principal production. This included the bulk of the Kansas scenes, including Garland\\'s performance of \"Over the Rainbow.\"[72]\\n Reshoots and pickup shots were done through April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. When the \"Over the Rainbow\" reprise was removed after subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back to reshoot the \"Auntie Em, I\\'m frightened!\" scene without the song. The footage of Blandick\\'s Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was reused.\\n After Hamilton\\'s severe injuries with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pickups for the scene where she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy had stunt double Betty Danko perform instead. Danko was severely injured when the smoke mechanism malfunctioned.[73]\\n At this point, the film began a long, arduous post-production. Herbert Stothart composed the film\\'s background score, while A. Arnold Gillespie perfected the special effects, including many of the rear-projection shots. The MGM art department created matte paintings for many scene backgrounds.\\n A significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone. However, it was abandoned because it was too expensive and labor-intensive, and MGM used a simpler, less expensive technique: During the May reshoots, the inside of the farmhouse was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame. Once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house\\'s shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland. If one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy and she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.\\n Test screenings of the film began on June 5, 1939.[74] Oz initially ran nearly two hours long. In 1939, the average film ran for about 90 minutes. LeRoy and Fleming knew they needed to cut at least 15 minutes to get the film down to a manageable running time. Three sneak previews in San Bernardino, Pomona and San Luis Obispo, California, guided LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were \"The Jitterbug\" number, the Scarecrow\\'s elaborate dance sequence following \"If I Only Had a Brain\", reprises of \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\", and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.\\n \"Over the Rainbow\" was almost deleted. MGM felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they eventually won. The song went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her signature song.\\n After the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time.\\n The film premiered at the Orpheum Theatre in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on August 10, 1939.[75] The first sneak preview was held in San Bernardino, California.[76] The film was previewed in three test markets: Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 11, 1939; Dennis, Massachusetts, also on August 11;[77][78] and the Strand Theatre in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, on August 12.[79]\\n The Hollywood premiere was on August 16, 1939,[78] following a preview the night before at Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre.[80] The New York City premiere, held at Loew\\'s Capitol Theatre on August 17, 1939, was followed by a live performance with Garland and her frequent film co-star Mickey Rooney. They continued to perform there after each screening for a week. Garland extended her appearance for two more weeks, partnered with Rooney for a second week and with Oz co-stars Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr for the third and final week. The film opened nationwide on August 25, 1939.\\n MGM sold CBS the rights to televise the film for $225,000 (equivalent to $1.93\\xa0million in 2023) per broadcast.[81] It was first shown on television on November 3, 1956, as the last installment of the Ford Star Jubilee.[82] It was a ratings success, with a Nielsen rating of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.[83]\\n It was repeated on December 13, 1959, and gained an even larger television audience, with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.[83] It became an annual television tradition.\\n The UK television premiere was on December 25, 1975, on BBC-1.  The estimated UK television audience was 20 million.[84]\\n On October 25, 1980, the film was released on videocassette (in both VHS and Betamax format) by MGM/CBS Home Video.[85] All current home video releases are by Warner Home Video (via current rights holder Turner Entertainment).\\n The film\\'s first LaserDisc release was in 1983. In 1989, there were two releases for the 50th anniversary, one from Turner and one from The Criterion Collection, with a commentary track. LaserDiscs came out in 1991 and 1993, and the final LaserDisc was released September 11, 1996.[86]\\n The film was released on the CED format once, in 1982, by MGM/UA Home Video.[87] It has also been released multiple times outside of the North American and European markets, in Asia, in the Video CD format.\\n The first DVD release was on March 26, 1997, by MGM/Turner. It contained no special features or supplements. On October 19, 1999, The Wizard of Oz was re-released by Warner Bros. to celebrate the film\\'s 60th anniversary, with its soundtrack presented in a new 5.1 surround sound mix. The DVD also contained a behind-the-scenes documentary, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic, produced in 1990 and hosted by Angela Lansbury, which was originally shown on television immediately following the 1990 telecast of the film. It had been featured in the 1993 \"Ultimate Oz\" LaserDisc release. Outtakes, the deleted \"Jitterbug\" musical number, clips of pre-1939 Oz adaptations, trailers, newsreels, and a portrait gallery were also included, as well as two radio programs of the era publicizing the film.\\n In 2005, two DVD editions were released, both featuring a newly restored version of the film with an audio commentary and an isolated music and effects track. One of the two DVD releases was a \"Two-Disc Special Edition\", featuring production documentaries, trailers, outtakes, newsreels, radio shows and still galleries. The other set, a \"Three-Disc Collector\\'s Edition\", included these features, as well as the digitally restored 80th-anniversary edition of the 1925 feature-length silent film version of The Wizard of Oz, other silent Oz adaptations and a 1933 animated short version.\\n The film was released on Blu-ray on September 29, 2009, for its 70th anniversary, in a four-disc \"Ultimate Collector\\'s Edition\", including all the bonus features from the 2005 Collector\\'s Edition DVD, new bonus features about Victor Fleming and the surviving Munchkins, the telefilm The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story, and the miniseries MGM: When the Lion Roars. For this edition, Warner Bros. commissioned a new transfer from the original negatives at 8K resolution. The restoration job was given to Prime Focus World.[88] This restored version also features a lossless 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio track.[89]\\n On December 1, 2009,[90] three Blu-ray discs of the Ultimate Collector\\'s Edition were repackaged as a less expensive \"Emerald Edition\". An Emerald Edition four-disc DVD arrived the following week. A single-disc Blu-ray, containing the restored movie and all the extra features of the two-disc Special Edition DVD, became available on March 16, 2010.[91]\\n In 2013, the film was re-released on DVD, Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and UltraViolet for the 90th anniversary of Warner Bros. and the 75th anniversary of the film.[92][93]\\n Many special editions were released in 2013 in celebration of the film\\'s 75th anniversary, including one exclusively by Best Buy (a SteelBook of the 3D Blu-ray) and another by Target stores that came with a keepsake lunch bag.[94][95]\\n The film was issued on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 29, 2019, featuring both a Dolby Vision and an HDR10+ grading from an 8K transfer.[96] Another 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release, including collective replica items from the film\\'s Hollywood premiere was released on November 5, 2024, to celebrate the film\\'s 85th anniversary.[97]\\n Although the 1949 re-issue used sepia tone, the 1955 re-issue showed the Kansas sequences in black and white instead, a practice that continued on television broadcasts and home releases until the 50th anniversary VHS release in 1989.[98]\\n The MGM \"Children\\'s Matinees\" series re-released the film twice, in both 1970 and 1971.[99] It was for this release that the film received a G rating from the MPAA.\\n For the film\\'s 60th anniversary, Warner Bros. released a \"Special Edition\" on November 6, 1998, digitally restored with remastered audio.\\n In 2002, the film had a very limited re-release in U.S. theaters, earning only $139,905.[100]\\n On September 23, 2009, the film was re-released in select theaters for a one-night-only event in honor of its 70th anniversary and as a promotion for various new disc releases later in the month. An encore of this event took place in theaters on November 17, 2009.[101]\\n An IMAX 3D theatrical re-release played at 300 theaters in North America for one week only beginning September 20, 2013, as part of the film\\'s 75th anniversary.[92] Warner Bros. spent $25\\xa0million on advertising. The studio hosted a premiere of the film\\'s first IMAX 3D release on September 15, 2013, in Hollywood at the newly remodeled TCL Chinese Theatre (formerly Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre, the site of the film\\'s Hollywood premiere). It was the first motion picture to play at the new theater and served as the grand opening of Hollywood\\'s first 3D IMAX screen. It was also shown as a special presentation at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.[102] This re-release grossed $5.6\\xa0million at the North American box office.[103]\\n In 2013, in preparation for its IMAX 3D release, the film was submitted to the MPAA for re-classification. According to MPAA rules, a film that has been altered in any way from its original version must be submitted for re-classification, and the 3-D conversion fell within that guideline. The 3D version received a PG rating for \"Some scary moments\", although no change was made to the film\\'s original story content. The 2D version still retains its G rating.[104]\\n The film was re-released on January 11 and 14, 2015, as part of the \"TCM Presents\" series by Turner Classic Movies.[105]\\n The film was re-released by Fathom Events through \"TCM Big Screen Classics\" on January 27, 29, 30, 2019, and February 3 and 5, 2019, as part of its 80th anniversary. It also had a one-week theatrical engagement in Dolby Cinema on October 25, 2019, to commemorate the anniversary.[106]\\n The film returned to theaters on June 5 and 6, 2022, to celebrate Judy Garland\\'s 100th birthday.[107]\\n To celebrate the 85th anniversary, \"Fathom Big Screen Classics\" (now taken over from TCM) released the film January 28, 29 and 31, 2024, with a special introduction by Leonard Maltin and a preshow trivia game hosted by \"Oz Vlog\" host Victoria Calamito.[108]\\n The Wizard of Oz received universal acclaim upon its release.[109][110] Writing for The New York Times, Frank Nugent considered the film a \"delightful piece of wonder-working which had the youngsters\\' eyes shining and brought a quietly amused gleam to the wiser ones of the oldsters. Not since Disney\\'s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has anything quite so fantastic succeeded half so well.\"[111] Nugent had issues with some of the film\\'s special effects:\\n with the best of will and ingenuity, they cannot make a Munchkin or a Flying Monkey that will not still suggest, however vaguely, a Singer\\'s Midget in a Jack Dawn masquerade. Nor can they, without a few betraying jolts and split-screen overlappings, bring down from the sky the great soap bubble in which Glinda rides and roll it smoothly into place.[111]\\n According to Nugent, \"Judy Garland\\'s Dorothy is a pert and fresh-faced miss with the wonder-lit eyes of a believer in fairy tales, but the Baum fantasy is at its best when the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Lion are on the move.\"[111]\\n Writing in Variety, John C. Flinn predicted that the film was \"likely to perform some record-breaking feats of box-office magic,\" noting, \"Some of the scenic passages are so beautiful in design and composition as to stir audiences by their sheer unfoldment.\" He also called Garland \"an appealing figure\" and the musical numbers \"gay and bright\".[112]\\n Harrison\\'s Reports wrote, \"Even though some persons are not interested in pictures of this type, it is possible that they will be eager to see this picture just for its technical treatment. The performances are good, and the incidental music is of considerable aid. Pictures of this caliber bring credit to the industry.\"[113]\\n Film Daily wrote:  Leo the Lion is privileged to herald this one with his deepest roar—the one that comes from way down—for seldom if indeed ever has the screen been so successful in its approach to fantasy and extravaganza through flesh-and-blood... handsomely mounted fairy story in Technicolor, with its wealth of humor and homespun philosophy, its stimulus to the imagination, its procession of unforgettable settings, its studding of merry tunes should click solidly at the box-office.[114] Some reviews were less positive. Some moviegoers felt that the 16-year-old Garland was slightly too old to play the little girl who Baum intended his Dorothy to be. Russell Maloney of The New Yorker wrote that the film displayed \"no trace of imagination, good taste, or ingenuity\" and declared it \"a stinkeroo\",[115] while Otis Ferguson of The New Republic wrote: \"It has dwarfs, music, Technicolor, freak characters, and Judy Garland. It can\\'t be expected to have a sense of humor, as well – and as for the light touch of fantasy, it weighs like a pound of fruitcake soaking wet.\"[116] Still, the film placed seventh on Film Daily\\'s year-end nationwide poll of 542 critics naming the best films of 1939.[117]\\n According to MGM records, during the film\\'s initial release, it earned $2,048,000 in the U.S. and $969,000 in other countries throughout the world, for total earnings of $3,017,000. However, its high production cost, plus the costs of marketing, distribution, and other services, resulted in a loss of $1,145,000 for the studio.[3] It did not show what MGM considered a profit until a 1949 re-release earned an additional $1.5\\xa0million (about $15 million in 2023). Christopher Finch, author of the Judy Garland biography Rainbow: The Stormy Life of Judy Garland, wrote: \"Fantasy is always a risk at the box office. The film had been enormously successful as a book, and it had also been a major stage hit, but previous attempts to bring it to the screen had been dismal failures.\" He also wrote that after the film\\'s success, Garland signed a new contract with MGM giving her a substantial increase in salary, making her one of the top ten box-office stars in the United States.[118]\\n The film was also re-released domestically in 1955. Subsequent re-releases between 1989 and 2019 have grossed $25,173,032 worldwide,[4] for a total worldwide gross of $29,690,032.\\n The film was not the first to utilize color, but the way in which the film was richly saturated with Technicolor proved that color can provide a magical element to fantasy films. The film is iconic for its symbols such as the Yellow Brick Road, ruby slippers, Emerald City, Munchkins, and the phrase \"There\\'s no place like home\".[119]The film became a global phenomenon and is still well known today.[120]\\n Roger Ebert chose it as one of his Great Films, writing that \"The Wizard of Oz has a wonderful surface of comedy and music, special effects and excitement, but we still watch it six decades later because its underlying story penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of childhood, stirs them and then reassures them.\"[121]\\n In his 1992 critique of the film for the British Film Institute, author Salman Rushdie acknowledged its effect on him, noting \"The Wizard of Oz was my very first literary influence\".[122] In \"Step Across This Line\", he wrote: \"When I first saw The Wizard of Oz, it made a writer of me.\"[123] His first short story, written at the age of 10, was titled \"Over the Rainbow\".[123]\\n In a 2009 retrospective article about the film, San Francisco Chronicle film critic and author Mick LaSalle declared:\\n ...the entire Munchkinland sequence, from Dorothy\\'s arrival in Oz to her departure on the yellow brick road, has to be one of the greatest in cinema history – a masterpiece of set design, costuming, choreography, music, lyrics, storytelling, and sheer imagination.[124]\\n In 2018, it was named the \"most influential film of all time\" as the result of a study conducted by the University of Turin to measure the success and significance of 47,000 films from around the world using data from readers and audience polls, as well as internet sources such as IMDb. It would top the list in their study, followed by the Star Wars franchise, Psycho (1960), King Kong (1933) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) rounding out the top 5.[125]\\n On the film review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, The Wizard of Oz has a 98% rating based on 169 reviews, with an average score of 9.4/10. Its critical consensus reads, \"An absolute masterpiece whose groundbreaking visuals and deft storytelling are still every bit as resonant, The Wizard of Oz is a must-see film for young and old.\"[126] At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film received a score of 92 out of 100, based on 30 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[127]\\n The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of \"Art\".[128]\\n The American Film Institute (AFI) has compiled various lists which include this film or its elements.\\n An official 1972 sequel, the animated Journey Back to Oz, featuring the voice of Judy Garland\\'s daughter Liza Minnelli was produced to commemorate the original film\\'s 35th anniversary.[145]\\n The Wiz, a musical based on the novel, opened in 1974 in Baltimore and in 1975 with a new cast on Broadway. It went on to win seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical.\\n In 1975, a comic book adaptation of the film titled MGM\\'s Marvelous Wizard of Oz was released. It was the first co-production between DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Marvel planned a series of sequels based on the subsequent novels. The first, The Marvelous Land of Oz, was published later that year. The next, The Marvelous Ozma of Oz was expected to be released the following year but never came to be.[146]\\n In 1985, Walt Disney Productions released the live-action fantasy film Return to Oz, starring Fairuza Balk in her film debut as a young Dorothy Gale[147] and based on The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904) and Ozma of Oz (1907). With a darker story, it fared poorly with critics unfamiliar with the Oz books and was not successful at the box office, although it has since become a popular cult film, with many considering it a more loyal and faithful adaptation of what L. Frank Baum envisioned.[148][149]\\n The Broadway musical Wicked premiered in 2003, and is based on the film and original novel. It has since gone on to become the second-highest grossing Broadway musical of all time, and won three Tony Awards, seven Drama Desk Awards, and a Grammy Award. A two-part film adaptation of the musical, directed by Jon M. Chu, has been in development at Universal Pictures since 2004, with Part One and Part Two scheduled to be released in 2024 and 2025 respectively.\\n Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice produced a stage musical of the same name, which opened in 2011 at the West End\\'s London Palladium.\\n An animated film called Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz was released in 2011 by Warner Home Video, incorporating Tom and Jerry into the story as Dorothy\\'s \"protectors\".[150] A sequel titled Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz was released on DVD on June 21, 2016.[151]\\n In 2013, Walt Disney Pictures released a \"spiritual prequel\" titled Oz the Great and Powerful. It was directed by Sam Raimi and starred James Franco, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams. It was the second film based on Baum\\'s Oz series to be produced by Disney, after Return to Oz. It was a commercial success but received a mixed reception from critics.[152][153]\\n In 2014, independent film company Clarius Entertainment released a big-budget animated musical film, Legends of Oz: Dorothy\\'s Return,[154] which follows Dorothy\\'s second trip to Oz. The film fared poorly at the box office and was received negatively by critics, largely for its plot and unmemorable musical numbers.\\n In February 2021, New Line Cinema, Temple Hill Entertainment and Wicked producer Marc Platt announced that a new film version of the original book is in the works with Watchmen\\'s Nicole Kassell slated to direct the reimagining, which will have the option to include elements from the 1939 film.[155]\\n In August 2022, it was announced that Kenya Barris would write and direct a modern remake.[156][157] In January 2024, Barris confirmed that he finished penning the script and remarked \"The original Wizard of Oz took place during the Great Depression and it was about self-reliance and what people were going through, I think this is the perfect time to switch the characters and talk about what someone imagines their life could be. It\\'s ultimately a hero\\'s journey, someone thinks something\\'s better than where they\\'re at, and they go and realize that where they\\'re at is where they should be. I want people to be proud and happy about where they\\'re from. But I want the world to take a look at it and I hope that will come through.\" This involved changing the time period to the present day and changing Dorothy\\'s home from Kansas to the Bottoms of Inglewood, California.[158]\\n The 2024 marketing campaign for season 22 of American Idol is directly themed after this film, complete with a commercial featuring Ryan Seacrest and the judges Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan dressed as Tin Man, Dorothy, Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow following the \"Golden Ticket Road\" to Hollywood. This was to reflect the show\\'s plans to visit the judges\\' hometowns throughout the season.[159][160]\\n According to the US Library of Congress exhibition The Wizard of Oz: an American Fairy Tale (2010):[161]\\n The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is America\\'s greatest and best-loved home-grown fairytale. The first totally American fantasy for children, it is one of the most-read children\\'s books\\xa0... Despite its many particularly American attributes, including a wizard from Omaha, [the 1939 film adaptation] has universal appeal...[162] Because of its many television showings between 1956 and 1974, it has been seen by more viewers than any other movie\".[10] In 1977, Aljean Harmetz wrote The Making of The Wizard of Oz, a detailed description of the creation of the film based on interviews and research; it was updated in 1989.[163]\\n Because of their iconic stature,[164] the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the film are now among the most treasured and valuable film memorabilia in movie history.[165] Dorothy actually wore Silver Shoes in the book series, but the color was changed to ruby to take advantage of the new Technicolor process. Adrian, MGM\\'s chief costume designer, was responsible for the final design. Five known pairs of the slippers exist.[166] Another, differently styled pair, not used in the film, was sold at auction by actress Debbie Reynolds for $510,000 (not including the buyer\\'s premium) in June 2011.[167] One pair of Judy Garland\\'s ruby slippers are located in Washington D.C. at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.[168]\\n In 2005, one of the pairs of the ruby slippers was stolen while on loan to the Judy Garland Museum in Garland\\'s hometown.  They were recovered in an FBI sting operation in 2018. At the time they were stolen, the slippers were insured for $1 million. As of 2023, the market value for them is about $3.5 million.[169] In 2023, the slipper thief was indicted with one count of a major artwork theft. The shoes are one of four authentic pairs that are still intact.[170]\\n In July 2021, Catholic University of America reported that a dress worn by Dorothy, believed to have been given to Rev. Gilbert Hartke by Mercedes McCambridge as a gift in 1973, was found in the university\\'s Hartke Building after being missing for many years. The university said an expert on the movie\\'s memorabilia at the Smithsonian\\'s National Museum of American History said five other dresses apparently worn by Judy Garland were \"probably authentic\". The dress found at the university had characteristics shared by the other five, including a \"secret pocket\" for Dorothy\\'s handkerchief, and Garland\\'s name written in a specific style. The university said the dress would be stored in Special Collections.\\n Another of the dresses sold at auction in 2015 for nearly $1.6 million.[171] Many other costumes have fetched six-figure prices as memorabilia. See List of film memorabilia.\\n The Wizard of Oz has a presence at the Disney Parks and Resorts. The film had its own scene at The Great Movie Ride at Disney Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World Resort, and is also represented in miniature at Disneyland and at Disneyland Paris as part of the Storybook Land Canal Boats attraction in Fantasyland.[172][173] The Great Movie Ride was shut down in 2017.[174]\\n On July 20, 2022, it was announced that Warner Bros. Movie World would be adding a new precinct based on the 1939 film The Wizard Of Oz. It is to feature 2 coasters manufactured by Vekoma and will open in 2024.[175]\\n Bibliography\\n Further reading', 'Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy\\'s Progress, is the second novel by English author Charles Dickens. It was originally published as a serial from 1837 to 1839 and as a three-volume book in 1838.[1] The story follows the titular orphan, who, after being raised in a workhouse, escapes to London, where he meets a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal Fagin, discovers the secrets of his parentage, and reconnects with his remaining family.\\n Oliver Twist unromantically portrays the sordid lives of criminals and exposes the cruel treatment of the many orphans in London in the mid-19th century.[2] The alternative title, The Parish Boy\\'s Progress, alludes to Bunyan\\'s The Pilgrim\\'s Progress as well as the 18th-century caricature series by painter William Hogarth, A Rake\\'s Progress and A Harlot\\'s Progress.[3]\\n In an early example of the social novel, Dickens satirises child labour, domestic violence, the recruitment of children as criminals, and the presence of street children. The novel may have been inspired by the story of Robert Blincoe, an orphan whose account of working as a child labourer in a cotton mill was widely read in the 1830s. It is likely that Dickens\\'s own experiences as a youth contributed as well, considering he spent two years of his life in the workhouse at the age of 12 and subsequently missed out on some of his education.[4]\\n Oliver Twist has been the subject of numerous adaptations, including the 1948 film of the same name, starring Alec Guinness as Fagin; a highly successful musical, Oliver! (itself adapted into the Oscar-winning 1968 film), and Disney\\'s 1988 animated feature film Oliver & Company.[5]\\n The novel was first published in monthly instalments, from February 1837 to April 1839, in the magazine Bentley\\'s Miscellany. It was originally intended to form part of Dickens\\'s serial, The Mudfog Papers.[6][7][8] George Cruikshank provided one steel etching per month to illustrate each instalment.[9] The novel first appeared in book form six months before the initial serialisation was completed, in three volumes published by Richard Bentley, the owner of Bentley\\'s Miscellany, under the author\\'s pseudonym, \"Boz\". It included 24 steel-engraved plates by Cruikshank.\\n The first edition was titled: Oliver Twist, or, The Parish Boy\\'s Progress.\\n Serial publication dates:[10]\\n Oliver Twist is born into a life of poverty and misfortune, raised in a workhouse in the fictional town of Mudfog. The children working there receive very little food; after six months, they draw lots, with the loser asking for another portion of gruel. Oliver is designated, and so he approaches workhouse manager Mr Bumble and humbly requests another serving. A great uproar ensues at this perceived act of rebellion. \\n Oliver is removed from the workhouse and sent into the service of the undertaker Mr Sowerberry. One day, his jealous co-apprentice, Noah Claypole, insults Oliver\\'s mother and an enraged Oliver attacks him. When he is punished by Mr Sowerberry, Oliver runs away to London to seek a better life.\\n \\nOliver meets a young man named Jack Dawkins who calls himself \"the Artful Dodger\", offers him food and lodging and takes him to meet an infamous criminal known as Fagin, who trains orphan boys as pickpockets. Oliver innocently begins Fagin\\'s training, but when he goes out with the Dodger and another boy and sees them stealing a handkerchief from an old gentleman named Mr Brownlow, he realizes the truth. While the Dodger and the other boy escape, Oliver is pursued, apprehended, formally arrested and tried before Magistrate Fang. Interceding for Oliver, Brownlow takes him home and cares for him. As Oliver recovers, Brownlow and his housekeeper notice that Oliver resembles a woman depicted in a portrait hanging in Brownlow\\'s home. Worried that Oliver might incriminate him and his gang, Fagin sends a young woman named Nancy and her abusive lover, the robber Bill Sikes, to abduct Oliver and bring him back to Fagin\\'s lair. Fagin forces him to participate in a burglary planned by Sikes. The robbery goes wrong; while Sikes escapes, Oliver, after having been wounded, ends up in the care of the people he was supposed to rob: Miss Rose and her guardian Mrs Maylie.\\n A mysterious man, known only as \"Monks,\" teams up with Fagin, to prevent Oliver from learning of his past. Monks bribes Mr Bumble and his new wife, the former Widow Corney, for information on Oliver. Together, they dispose of a ring and medallion that had once belonged to Oliver\\'s mother and had been stolen from her after she died. Nancy, racked with guilt for her role in Oliver\\'s kidnapping, secretly spies on them and passes the information on to Rose Maylie, who tells Mr Brownlow. Meanwhile, the Artful Dodger is arrested for pickpocketing, tried and sentenced to transportation to Australia.\\n Noah Claypole, who had fled to London with the Sowerberrys\\' maid Charlotte after robbing Mr Sowerberry, joins Fagin\\'s gang. Following Fagin\\'s orders, he follows Nancy and discovers that she regularly meets with the Brownlows and Maylies for the sake of Oliver\\'s welfare. Fearing that Nancy has betrayed him and Sikes (which, unknown to him, she has refused to do), Fagin passes the information on to Sikes, who beats Nancy to death in a fit of rage and goes into hiding. He is recognised by an angry mob and attempts to flee. Going to Toby Crackit\\'s hideout, he learns that Fagin has been arrested. When the mob catches up to him, he tries to escape over the rooftops by swinging on a rope, but while he is about to loop the rope about himself a vision of the dead Nancy\\'s staring eyes terrorises him into losing his balance; in the fall, the looped rope catches him around the neck and hangs him.\\n Mr Brownlow has Monks arrested and forces him to divulge his secrets: he is actually Oliver\\'s half-brother and had hoped to steal Oliver\\'s half of their rightful inheritance. Brownlow begs Oliver to give half his inheritance to Monks and grant him a second chance, to which Oliver happily agrees. Monks emigrates to America, but squanders his money, relapses into crime and dies in prison. Fagin is arrested and sentenced to the gallows. The day before his execution, Oliver and Mr Brownlow visit him in Newgate Prison and learn the location of the documents proving Oliver\\'s identity. Bumble and his wife lose their jobs and are forced to become inmates of the workhouse.  Rose Maylie, who turns out to be Oliver\\'s maternal aunt, marries and enjoys a long life. Oliver lives happily as Mr Brownlow\\'s adopted son.\\n In Oliver Twist, Dickens mixes grim realism with merciless satire to describe the effects of industrialism on 19th-century England and to criticise the harsh new Poor Laws. Oliver, an innocent child, is trapped in a world where his only options seem to be the workhouse, a life of crime symbolised by Fagin\\'s gang, a prison, or an early grave. From this unpromising industrial/institutional setting, however, a fairy tale also emerges. In the midst of corruption and degradation, the essentially passive Oliver remains pure-hearted; he steers away from evil when those around him give in to it, and in proper fairy-tale fashion, he eventually receives his reward – leaving for a peaceful life in the country, surrounded by kind friends. On the way to this happy ending, Dickens explores the kind of life an outcast, orphan boy could expect to lead in 1830s London.[11]\\n Poverty is a prominent concern in Oliver Twist. Throughout the novel, Dickens enlarged on this theme, describing slums so decrepit that whole rows of houses are on the point of ruin. In an early chapter, Oliver attends a pauper\\'s funeral with Mr Sowerberry and sees a whole family crowded together in one miserable room. This prevalent misery makes Oliver\\'s encounters with charity and love more poignant. Oliver owes his life several times over to kindness both large and small.[12]\\n Dickens makes considerable use of symbolism. The \"merry old gentleman\" Fagin, for example, has satanic characteristics: he is a veteran corrupter of young boys who presides over his own corner of the criminal world; he makes his first appearance standing over a fire holding a toasting fork, and he refuses to pray on the night before his execution.[13]\\n In the tradition of Restoration Comedy and Henry Fielding, Dickens fits his characters with appropriate names. Oliver himself, though \"badged and ticketed\" as a lowly orphan and named according to an alphabetical system, is, in fact, \"all of a twist.\"[14] However, Oliver and his name may have been based on a young workhouse boy named Peter Tolliver whom Dickens knew while growing up.[15]\\n Bill Sikes\\'s dog, Bull\\'s-eye, has \"faults of temper in common with his owner\" and is an emblem of his owner\\'s character. The dog\\'s viciousness represents Sikes\\'s animal-like brutality while Sikes\\'s self-destructiveness is evident in the dog\\'s many scars. The dog, with its willingness to harm anyone on Sikes\\'s whim, shows the mindless brutality of the master. This is also illustrated when Bull\\'s-eye dies immediately after his master.[16]\\n Nancy, by contrast, redeems herself at the cost of her own life and dies in a prayerful pose. She is one of the few characters in Oliver Twist to display much ambivalence. Her storyline in the novel strongly reflects themes of domestic violence and psychological abuse at the hands of Bill. Although Nancy is a full-fledged criminal, indoctrinated and trained by Fagin since childhood, she retains enough empathy to repent her role in Oliver\\'s kidnapping, and to take steps to try to atone. As one of Fagin\\'s victims, corrupted but not yet morally dead, she gives eloquent voice to the horrors of the old man\\'s little criminal empire. She wants to save Oliver from a similar fate; at the same time, she recoils from the idea of turning traitor, especially to Bill Sikes, whom she loves. When Dickens was later criticised for giving to a \"thieving, whoring slut of the streets\" such an unaccountable reversal of character, he ascribed her change of heart to \"the last fair drop of water at the bottom of a dried-up, weed-choked well\".[17]\\n Dickens has been accused of portraying antisemitic stereotypes because of his portrayal of the Jewish character Fagin in Oliver Twist. Paul Vallely writes that Fagin is widely seen as one of the most grotesque Jews in English literature, and one of the most vivid of Dickens\\'s 989 characters.[18] Nadia Valman, in Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, argues that Fagin\\'s representation was drawn from the image of the Jew as inherently evil, that the imagery associated him with the Devil, and with beasts.[19]\\n The novel refers to Fagin 274 times[20] in the first 38 chapters as \"the Jew\", while the ethnicity or religion of the other characters is rarely mentioned.[18] In 1854, The Jewish Chronicle asked why \"Jews alone should be excluded from the \\'sympathizing heart\\' of this great author and powerful friend of the oppressed.\" Dickens (who had extensive knowledge of London street life and child exploitation) explained that he had made Fagin Jewish because \"it unfortunately was true, of the time to which the story refers, that that class of criminal almost invariably was a Jew.\"[21] It is widely believed that Fagin was based on a specific Jewish criminal of the era, Ikey Solomon.[22] Dickens commented that by calling Fagin a Jew he had meant no imputation against the Jewish people, saying in a letter, \"I have no feeling towards the Jews but a friendly one. I always speak well of them, whether in public or private, and bear my testimony (as I ought to do) to their perfect good faith in such transactions as I have ever had with them.\"[23] Eliza Davis, whose husband had purchased Dickens\\'s home in 1860 when he had put it up for sale, wrote to Dickens in protest at his portrayal of Fagin, arguing that he had \"encouraged a vile prejudice against the despised Hebrew\", and that he had done a great wrong to the Jewish people. While Dickens first reacted defensively upon receiving Davis\\'s letter, he then halted the printing of Oliver Twist, and changed the text for the parts of the book that had not been set, which explains why after the first 38 chapters Fagin is barely called \"the Jew\" at all in the next 179 references to him. A shift in his perspective is seen in his later novel Our Mutual Friend, as he redeems the image of Jews.[18]\\n Contemporary reviewers including John Forster and the Literary Gazette praised the book for its realistic depiction of social conditions. However others such as Richard Ford considered it an exaggeration of poverty.[24]\\n Dickens\\'s novel has been recorded many times as an audiobook. Notable recordings include:', '\"The Twelve Dancing Princesses\" (or \"The Worn-Out Dancing Shoes\" or \"The Shoes that were Danced to Pieces\") (German: Die zertanzten Schuhe) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm and published in Grimm\\'s Fairy Tales in 1815 (KHM 133).[1] It is of Aarne-Thompson type 306.[1]\\n Charles Deulin collected another, French version in his Contes du Roi Cambrinus (1874), which he credited to the Grimm version.[2] Alexander Afanasyev collected two Russian variants, entitled \"The Night Dances\", in his Narodnye russkie skazki.[3]\\n Its closest analogue is the Scottish Kate Crackernuts, where it is a prince who is obliged to dance every night.[citation needed]\\n The tale was published by the Brothers Grimm in the first edition of Kinder- und Hausmärchen, volume 2, in 1815. Their source was Jenny von Droste-Hülshoff. It was originally numbered 47 but appeared as KHM 133 in subsequent editions.[1]\\n In a kingdom lives a king and his twelve daughters. The twelve princesses sleep in twelve beds in the same bedroom, the doors to which their father locks every night. But every morning, the king unlocks his daughters\\' bedroom doors to find their shoes worn out as if they have been dancing all night. The king, perplexed, promises that any man who can solve the mystery can marry any of the twelve princesses and inherit the kingdom, but every suitor will be given only three days and three nights to discover the princesses\\' secret, or he will be beheaded.\\n Many princes attempt to discover where the twelve princesses dance every night, but all of them fail and are executed. An old soldier, returning from war, meets an old woman to whom he tells of his decision to try the king\\'s challenge. The old woman warns the soldier to avoid drinking the wine the princesses will give him and to pretend to be fast asleep until they leave, and gives him an invisibility cloak that he can use to observe them.\\n The soldier is well received at the palace and in the evening, the eldest princess comes to his chamber and offers him a cup of wine. The soldier, remembering the old woman\\'s advice, secretly pours the wine into a sponge he has tied under his chin and lies on his bed, snoring loudly as if he were asleep.\\n The twelve princesses, assured that the soldier is asleep, dress themselves in fine dancing gowns and escape from their room by a trapdoor  beneath the eldest one\\'s bed. The soldier, seeing this, puts on his invisibility cloak and follows them down a flight of stairs. He steps on the gown of the youngest princess, whose cry of alarm to her sisters is rebuffed by the eldest. The passageway leads them to three groves of trees: the first having silver trees, the second golden trees, and the third diamond trees. The invisible soldier breaks off a twig from each grove as evidence, scaring the youngest princess each time he does so. Whenever the youngest princess warns her sisters of the sounds of wood cracking, the eldest dismisses them as salutes. They walk on until they come upon a great clear lake where twelve princes, in twelve boats, are waiting for the twelve princesses. Each princess gets into one boat, the soldier boarding the same one as the youngest princess. The twelfth prince complains to the twelfth princess that their boat is heavier than usual, unaware that the soldier is also on board. On the other side of the lake stands a castle, into which the twelve princesses go and dance the night away.\\n The twelve princesses happily dance until three in the morning when their shoes are worn out and they must leave. When the twelve princes row the twelve princesses back across the lake, the soldier sits by the eldest. When they reach the top of the secret staircase, the soldier runs ahead of the twelve princesses and lies back in his bed, snoring to trick them into thinking that their secret remains safe.\\n The soldier does not tell the king of his discovery right away, and follows and spies on the twelve princesses on the second and third nights, with everything happening just as before, except that on the third night, the soldier carries away a cup as a fourth token of where he has been. When the time comes for him to declare the princesses\\' secret, the soldier presents before the king the three twigs and the cup, and tells the king about all he has seen. The princesses know that there is no use in denying the truth, and confess. The soldier chooses the eldest princess as his bride for he is no longer a young man, and is made the king\\'s heir.\\n The twelve princes are cursed for as many nights as they have danced with the twelve princesses.\\n The Brothers Grimm learned the tale from their friends, the Haxthausens, who had heard the tale in Münster. Other versions were known in Hesse and Paderborn. In the Hesse version, only one princess is believed to be responsible for wearing out a dozen shoes every night until a young shoemaker\\'s apprentice discovers that she is joined by eleven other princesses in the revels. The spell is broken, and the apprentice marries the princess. In the Paderborn version, it is three princesses who dance nightly in a palace escorted by three giants.[4] This version introduces the ruse of the soldier disposing of the drugged wine and pretending to be asleep.[5]\\n Victorian editors disliked the \"do or die\" aspect imposed upon those willing to discover the Princesses\\' whereabouts, and found ways to avoid it. The candidates who failed simply vanished without explanation instead of being sent to their deaths. Andrew Lang\\'s version has the questing princes vanish and it is revealed they have been enchanted and trapped in the underground world. The hero of Lang\\'s version is a cowherd named Michael, who marries the youngest princess, Lina, not the eldest. Her sisters each marry one of the contestants once they are freed from the enchantment.\\n The garden of trees with gold, silver, and diamond leaves recalls a similar garden in the Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh.[5]\\n The Princesses in the Grimms\\' version are often portrayed as somewhat malicious characters, showing no remorse for lying to their father, and repeatedly giving their suitors drugged wine to ensure that their mystery remains unsolved, despite knowing that those who fail are put to death in some versions of the story.\\n The tale is not likely to be earlier than the 17th century and many variants are known from different countries.[6]\\n In variants, the princesses vary in number, sometimes being just one maiden. In other variants, the princess goes to a night dance with a supernatural character, such as the Devil.\\n A French literary version exists, penned by Charles Deulin in his Contes du Roi Cambrinus.[21]', 'The Pied Piper of Hamelin (German: der Rattenfänger von Hameln, also known as the Pan Piper or the Rat-Catcher of Hamelin) is the title character of a legend from the town of Hamelin (Hameln), Lower Saxony, Germany.\\n The legend dates back to the Middle Ages. The earliest references describe a piper, dressed in multicoloured (\"pied\") clothing, who was a rat catcher hired by the town to lure rats away[1] with his magic pipe. When the citizens refused to pay for this service as promised, he retaliated by using his instrument\\'s magical power on their children, leading them away as he had the rats. This version of the story spread as folklore and has appeared in the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Brothers Grimm, and Robert Browning, among others. The phrase \"pied piper\" has become a metaphor for a person who attracts a following through charisma or false promises.[2]\\n There are many contradictory theories about the Pied Piper. Some suggest he was a symbol of hope to the people of Hamelin, which had been attacked by plague; he drove the rats from Hamelin, saving the people from the epidemic.[3]\\n In 1284, while the town of Hamelin was suffering from a rat infestation, a piper dressed in multicoloured (\"pied\") clothing appeared, claiming to be a rat-catcher. He promised the mayor a solution to their problem with the rats. The mayor, in turn, promised to pay him 1,000 guilders for the removal of the rats. The piper accepted and played his pipe to lure the rats into the Weser River, where all the rats drowned.[4]\\n Despite the piper\\'s success, the mayor reneged on his promise and refused to pay him the full sum (reputedly reduced to 50 guilders) even going so far as to blame the piper for bringing the rats himself in an extortion attempt. Enraged, the piper stormed out of the town, vowing to return later to take revenge. On Saint John and Paul\\'s day, while the adults were in church, the piper returned, dressed in green like a hunter and playing his pipe. In so doing, he attracted the town\\'s children. One hundred and thirty children followed him out of town and into a mountains’ cave, after which they were never seen again. Depending on the version, at most three children remained behind: one was lame and could not follow quickly enough, the second was deaf and therefore could not hear the music, and the last was blind and therefore unable to see where he was going. These three informed the villagers of what had happened when they came out from church.[4]\\n Other versions relate that the Pied Piper led the children to the top of Koppelberg Hill, where he took them to a beautiful land,[5] or a place called Koppenberg Mountain,[6] or Transylvania. In yet other versions, he made them walk into the Weser as he did with the rats, and they all drowned. Or, the Piper returned the children after extorting payment, or the children were returned only after the villagers paid several times the original payment in gold.[4][7]\\n The Hamelin street named Bungelosenstrasse (\"street without drums\") is believed to be the last place that the children were seen. Ever since, music or dancing is not allowed on this street.[8][9]\\n The earliest mention of the story seems to have been on a stained-glass window placed in the Church of Hamelin c.\\u20091300. The window was described in several accounts between the 14th and 17th centuries.[10] It was destroyed in 1660. Based on the surviving descriptions, a modern reconstruction of the window has been created by historian Hans Dobbertin. It features the colourful figure of the Pied Piper and several figures of children dressed in white.[11][failed verification]\\n The window is generally considered to have been created in memory of a tragic historical event for the town; Hamelin town records also apparently start with this event.[citation needed]\\n Although research has been conducted for centuries, no explanation for the historical event is universally accepted as true. In any case, the rats were first added to the story in a version from c.\\u20091559 and are absent from earlier accounts.[12]\\n Decan Lude of Hamelin was reported c.\\u20091384 to have in his possession a chorus book containing a Latin verse giving an eyewitness account of the event.[13][further explanation needed]\\n The Lüneburg manuscript (c.\\u20091440–50) gives an early German account of the event.[14] An article by James P. O\\'Donnell in The Saturday Evening Post (December 24, 1955) tells how an elderly German researcher, Heinrich Spanuth, discovered the earliest version of the story in the Luneberg city archives in 1936.  \\n \\nOn the back of the last tattered page of a dusty chronicle called The Golden Chain, written in Latin in 1370 by the monk Heinrich of Herford, there is written in a different handwriting the following account:[15] Here follows a marvellous wonder, which transpired in the town of Hamelin in the diocese of Minden, in this Year of Our Lord, 1284, on the Feast of Saints John and Paul. A certain young man thirty years of age, handsome and well-dressed, so that all who saw him admired him because of his appearance, crossed the bridges and entered the town by the West Gate. He then began to play all through the town a silver pipe of the most magnificent sort. All the children who heard his pipe, in the number of 130, followed him to the East Gate and out of the town to the so-called execution place or Calvary. There they proceeded to vanish, so that no trace of them could be found. The mothers of the children ran from town to town, but they found nothing. It is written: A voice was heard from on high, and a mother was bewailing her son. And as one counts the years according to the Year of Our Lord or according to the first, second or third year of an anniversary, so do the people in Hamelin reckon the years after the departure and disappearance of their children. This report I found in an old book. And the mother of the Dean Johann von Lüde saw the children depart.[16][17][18][note 1] It is rendered in the following form in an inscription on a house known as Rattenfängerhaus (English: \"Rat Catcher\\'s House\" or Pied Piper\\'s House) in Hamelin:[14]\\n anno 1284 am dage johannis et pauli war der 26. juni dorch einen piper mit allerley farve bekledet gewesen cxxx kinder verledet binnen hameln geboren to calvarie bi den koppen verloren\\n (In the year 1284 on the day of [Saints] John and Paul on 26 June 130 children born in Hamelin were lured by a piper clothed in many colours to Calvary near the Koppen, [and] lost)\\n According to author Fanny Rostek-Lühmann this is the oldest surviving account. Koppen (High German Kuppe, meaning a knoll or domed hill) seems to be a reference to one of several hills surrounding Hamelin. Which of them was intended by the manuscript\\'s author remains uncertain.[19]\\n A similar inscription can be found on the \"Wedding- or Hochzeitshaus, a fine structure erected between 1610 and 1617[20] for marriage festivities, but diverted from its purpose since 1721. Behind rises the spire of the parish church of St. Nicholas which, in the words of an English book of folklore, may still \"enwall stones that witness how the parents prayed, while the Piper wrought sorrow for them without\":[21]\\n Nach Christi Geburt 1284 Jahr Gingen bei den Koppen unter Verwahr Hundert und dreissig Kinder, in Hameln geboren von einem Pfeiffer verfürt und verloren\\n In the year of Our Lord 1284 went into the Koppen under custody 130 children born in Hamelin by a piper seduced and lost\\n A portion of the town gate dating from the year 1556 is currently exhibited at the Hamelin Museum. According to Hamelin Museum, this stone is the oldest surviving sculptural evidence for the legend.[22] It bears the following inscription:[23]\\n Anno 1556 / Centu[m] ter denos\\nC[um] mag[us] ab urbe puellos /\\nDuxerat a[n]te a[n]nos 272.\\nCondita porta fuit\\n In the year 1556, \\n272 years after the magician \\nstole 130 children from the city, \\nthis gate was founded.\\n \\nThe Hamelin Museum writes:[24] In the mid 14th Century, a monk from Minden, Heinrich von Herford, puts together a collection of holy legends called the \"Catena Aurea\". \\xa0It speaks of a \"miracle\" that took place in 1284 in Hamelin. \\xa0A youth appeared and played on a strange silver flute. \\xa0Every child that heard the flute, followed the stranger. \\xa0They left Hamelin by the Eastern gate and disappeared at Kalvarien Hill. \\xa0This is the oldest known account of this occurrence. Around this time a verse of rhyme is found in \"zu Hameln im Kloster\". \\xa0It tells about the children\\'s disappearance. \\xa0It is written in red ink on the title page of a missal. \\xa0It bewails \"the 130 beloved Hamelner children\" who were \"eaten alive by Calvaria\". \\xa0The original verses are probably the oldest written source of this legend. \\xa0It has been missing for hundreds of years.[note 2] However, different versions of transcriptions of handwritten copies still exist. One was published by Heinrich Meibom in 1688.[25] Another was included by Johann Daniel Gottlieb Herr under the title Passionale Sanctorum in Collectanea zur Geschichte der Stadt Hameln. His manuscript is dated 1761.[26] There are some Latin verses which had a prose version underneath:[27]\\n\\n Maria audi nos, tibi Filius nil negat. \\nPost duo C. C. mille post octoginta quaterue\\n—Annus hic est ille, quo languet sexus uterque—\\nOrbantis pueros centumque triginta Joannis\\nEt Pauli caros Hamelenses non sine damnis,\\nFatur, ut omnes eos vivos Calvaria sorpsit,\\nChristi tuere reos, ne tam mala res quibus obsit.\\n\\nAnno millesimo ducentesimo octuagesimo quarto in die Johannis et Pauli perdiderunt Hamelenses centum et triginta pueros, qui intraverunt montem Calvariam.\\n Mary, hear us, for your Son denies you nothing. \\n1284 is that year when members of \\nboth sexes languish (through weakness), \\nthe year of the day John and Paul, which the 130 dear children of Hamelin swept away \\nand not without doom. \\nIt is said that Calvary swallowed them alive. \\nChrist, protect the guilty so that no similar evil fate overtake them.[26]\\n\\nIn the year one thousand two hundred and eighty-four, on the day of John and Paul, the Hamelin lost a hundred and thirty children who entered Calvary mount.\\n Somewhere between 1559 and 1565, Count Froben Christoph von Zimmern included a version in his Zimmerische Chronik.[28] This appears to be the earliest account which mentions the plague of rats. Von Zimmern dates the event only as \"several hundred years ago\" (vor etlichen hundert jarn  [sic]), so that his version throws no light on the conflict of dates (see next paragraph). Another contemporary account is that of Johann Weyer in his De praestigiis daemonum (1563).[29]\\n \\nA number of theories suggest that children died of some natural causes such as disease or starvation,[30] and that the Piper was a symbolic figure of Death.  Analogous themes which are associated with this theory include the Dance of Death, Totentanz or Danse Macabre, a common medieval trope. Some of the scenarios that have been suggested as fitting this theory include that the children drowned in the river Weser, were killed in a landslide or contracted some disease during an epidemic. Another modern interpretation reads the story as alluding to an event where Hamelin children were lured away by a pagan or heretic sect to forests near Coppenbrügge (the mysterious Koppen \"hills\" of the poem) for ritual dancing where they all perished during a sudden landslide or collapsing sinkhole.[31]\\n Speculation on the emigration theory is based on the idea that, by the 13th century, overpopulation of the area resulted in the oldest son owning all the land and power (majorat), leaving the rest as serfs.[32] It has also been suggested that one reason the emigration of the children was never documented was that the children were sold to a recruiter from the Baltic region of Eastern Europe, a practice that was common at the time. [citation needed] In his book The Pied Piper: A Handbook, Wolfgang Mieder states that historical documents exist showing that people from the area including Hamelin did help settle parts of Transylvania.[33] Emily Gerard reports in The Land Beyond the Forest an element of the folktale that \"popular tradition has averred the Germans who about that time made their appearance in Transylvania to be no other than the lost children of Hameln, who, having performed their long journey by subterranean passages, reissued to the light of day through the opening of a cavern known as the Almescher Höhle, in the north-east of Transylvania.\"[34] Transylvania had suffered under lengthy Mongol invasions of Central Europe, led by two grandsons of Genghis Khan and which date from around the time of the earliest appearance of the legend of the piper, the early 13th century.[35]\\n In the version of the legend posted on the official website for the town of Hamelin, another aspect of the emigration theory is presented:\\n Among the various interpretations, reference to the colonization of East Europe starting from Low Germany is the most plausible one: The \"Children of Hameln\" would have been in those days citizens willing to emigrate being recruited by landowners to settle in Moravia, East Prussia, Pomerania or in the Teutonic Land. It is assumed that in past times all people of a town were referred to as \"children of the town\" or \"town children\" as is frequently done today. The \"Legend of the children\\'s Exodus\" was later connected to the \"Legend of expelling the rats\". This most certainly refers to the rat plagues being a great threat in the medieval milling town and the more or less successful professional rat catchers.[36] The theory is provided credence by the fact that family names common to Hamelin at the time \"show up with surprising frequency in the areas of Uckermark and Prignitz, near Berlin.\"[37]\\n Historian Ursula Sautter, citing the work of linguist Jürgen Udolph, offers this hypothesis in support of the emigration theory:\\n \"After the defeat of the Danes at the Battle of Bornhöved in 1227,\" explains Udolph, \"the region south of the Baltic Sea, which was then inhabited by Slavs, became available for colonization by the Germans.\" The bishops and dukes of Pomerania, Brandenburg, Uckermark and Prignitz sent out glib \"locators\", medieval recruitment officers, offering rich rewards to those who were willing to move to the new lands. Thousands of young adults from Lower Saxony and Westphalia headed east. And as evidence, about a dozen Westphalian place names show up in this area. Indeed there are five villages called Hindenburg running in a straight line from Westphalia to Pomerania, as well as three eastern Spiegelbergs and a trail of etymology from Beverungen south of Hamelin to Beveringen northwest of Berlin to Beweringen in modern Poland.[38] Udolph favours the hypothesis that the Hamelin youths wound up in what is now Poland.[39] Genealogist Dick Eastman cited Udolph\\'s research on Hamelin surnames that have shown up in Polish phonebooks:\\n Linguistics professor Jürgen Udolph says that 130 children did vanish on a June day in the year 1284 from the German village of Hamelin (Hameln in German). Udolph entered all the known family names in the village at that time and then started searching for matches elsewhere. He found that the same surnames occur with amazing frequency in the regions of Prignitz and Uckermark, both north of Berlin. He also found the same surnames in the former Pomeranian region, which is now a part of Poland.\\n Udolph surmises that the children were actually unemployed youths who had been sucked into the German drive to colonize its new settlements in Eastern Europe. The Pied Piper may never have existed as such, but, says the professor, \"There were characters known as lokators who roamed northern Germany trying to recruit settlers for the East.\" Some of them were brightly dressed, and all were silver-tongued.\\n Professor Udolph can show that the Hamelin exodus should be linked with the Battle of Bornhöved in 1227 which broke the Danish hold on Eastern Europe. That opened the way for German colonization, and by the latter part of the thirteenth century there were systematic attempts to bring able-bodied youths to Brandenburg and Pomerania. The settlement, according to the professor\\'s name search, ended up near Starogard in what is now northwestern Poland. A village near Hamelin, for example, is called Beverungen and has an almost exact counterpart called Beveringen, near Pritzwalk, north of Berlin and another called Beweringen, near Starogard.\\n \\nLocal Polish telephone books list names that are not the typical Slavic names one would expect in that region. Instead, many of the names seem to be derived from German names that were common in the village of Hamelin in the thirteenth century. In fact, the names in today\\'s Polish telephone directories include Hamel, Hamler and Hamelnikow, all apparently derived from the name of the original village.[40] Some theories have linked the disappearance of the children to mass psychogenic illness in the form of dancing mania. Dancing mania outbreaks occurred during the 13th century, including one in 1237 in which a large group of children travelled from Erfurt to Arnstadt (about 20\\xa0km (12\\xa0mi)), jumping and dancing all the way,[41] in marked similarity to the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, which originated at around the same time.[42]\\n Others have suggested that the children left Hamelin to be part of a pilgrimage, a military campaign, or even a new Children\\'s Crusade (which is said to have occurred in 1212) but never returned to their parents. These theories see the unnamed Piper as their leader or a recruiting agent. The townspeople made up this story (instead of recording the facts) to avoid the wrath of the church or the king.[43]\\n William Manchester\\'s A World Lit Only by Fire places the events in 1484, and further proposes that the Pied Piper was a psychopathic paedophile.[44]\\n \"The Piper is coming nearer,\" he said, \"he is nearer than he was that evening I saw him before. His long, shadowy cloak is blowing around him. He pipes—he pipes—and we must follow—Jem and Carl and Jerry and I—round and round the world. Listen—listen—can\\'t you hear his wild music?\"[47] In linguistics, pied-piping is the common name for the ability of question words and relative pronouns to drag other words along with them when brought to the front, as part of the phenomenon called Wh-movement. For example, in \"For whom are the pictures?\", the word \"for\" is pied-piped by \"whom\" away from its declarative position (\"The pictures are for me\"), and in \"The mayor, pictures of whom adorn his office walls\" both words \"pictures of\" are pied-piped in front of the relative pronoun, which normally starts the relative clause.\\n Some researchers believe that the tale has inspired the common English phrase \"pay the piper\".[67] This phrase implies that the person who provides payment or funding for something has the authority to dictate how it should be done. However, the phrase \"pay the piper\" may also be a contraction of the English proverb \"he who pays the piper calls the tune.\"[67] This proverb, in contrast to the modern interpretation of paying a debt, suggests that the person who bears the financial responsibility for something also has the right to determine how it should be carried out.[68]\\n The present-day city of Hamelin continues to maintain information about the Pied Piper legend and possible origins of the story on its website.  Interest in the city\\'s connection to the story remains so strong that, in 2009, Hamelin held a tourist festival to mark the 725th anniversary of the disappearance of the town\\'s earlier children.[69] The Rat Catcher\\'s House is popular with visitors, although it bears no connection to the Rat-Catcher version of the legend.  Indeed, the Rattenfängerhaus is instead associated with the story due to the earlier inscription upon its facade mentioning the legend.  The house was built much later, in 1602 and 1603.  It is now a Hamelin City-owned restaurant with a Pied Piper theme throughout.[70] The city also maintains an online shop with rat-themed merchandise as well as offering an officially licensed Hamelin Edition of the popular board game Monopoly which depicts the legendary Piper on the cover.[71]\\n In addition to the recent milestone festival, each year the city marks 26 June as \"Rat Catcher\\'s Day\". In the United States, a similar holiday for exterminators based on Rat Catcher\\'s Day is marked on 22 July, but has not caught on.[72]', '\"The Princess and the Pea\" (Danish: Prinsessen på Ærten, lit.\\u2009\\'The Princess on the Pea\\')[1] is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a princess who is tested to become the wife to a lonely prince. The tale was first published with three others by Andersen in a cheap booklet on 8\\xa0May 1835 in Copenhagen by C. A. Reitzel.\\n The tale is classified in the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index as ATU 704, \"The Princess and the Pea\".[2]\\n The story tells of a prince who wants to marry a princess but is having difficulty finding a suitable wife. He meets many princesses, but is never sure that they are real (Danish: rigtig, lit.\\u2009\\'rightful\\') princesses—until one stormy night, when a mysterious young woman drenched with rain seeks shelter in the prince\\'s castle. She claims to be a princess, but the prince\\'s mother, the queen, has doubts. She decides to test their unexpected guest by placing a hard uncooked pea in the bed she is offered for the night, covered by twenty mattresses and twenty featherbeds.\\n In the morning, the mysterious woman tells her hosts that she endured a rather restless night, kept awake by something in the bed that made her feel uncomfortable. The prince\\'s family realizes that she is a princess after all, since only a true princess could be so delicate. The prince and the princess are happily married, and the story ends with the pea being placed in a museum, where it might still remain.\\n Researcher Jack Zipes said that Andersen, during his lifetime, \"was obliged to act as a dominated subject within the dominant social circles despite his fame and recognition as a writer.\" He therefore had a mixed opinion of the upper classes, at the same time aspiring to them and scorning them. According to Zipes and other writers, this tendency found expression in Andersen\\'s stories, where people like the princess undergo ordeals to prove their virtuousness.[3]\\n While a 1905 article in the American Journal of Education recommended the story for children aged 8–10,[4] \"The Princess and the Pea\" was not uniformly well received by critics. Toksvig wrote in 1934, \"[the story] seems to the reviewer not only indelicate but indefensible, in so far as the child might absorb the false idea that great ladies must always be so terribly thin-skinned.\"[5]\\n \"The Princess and the Pea\" spurred on positive criticism, as well. In fact, critic Paul Hazard pointed out the realistic aspects of the fairy tale that make it easily relatable to all people. He believed that \"the world Andersen witnessed—which encompassed sorrow, death, evil and man\\'s follies—is reflected in his tales,\" and most evidently in \"The Princess and the Pea.\" Another scholar, Niels Kofoed, noticed that “since they involve everyday-life themes of love, death, nature, injustice, suffering and poverty, they appeal to all races, ideologies, classes and genders.” Moreover, Celia Catlett Anderson realized that one of the things that makes this story so appealing and relatable is that optimism prevails over pessimism, especially for the main character of the princess. This inspires hope in the readers for their own futures and strength within themselves.[3]\\n In 1927, German composer Ernst Toch published an opera based on \"The Princess and the Pea\", with a libretto by Benno Elkan.[6] Reportedly this opera was very popular in the American student repertoires;[7] the music, as well as the English translation (by Marion Farquhar), were praised in a review in Notes.[6] The story was adapted to the musical stage in 1959 as Once Upon a Mattress, with comedian Carol Burnett playing the play\\'s heroine, Princess Winnifred the Woebegone. The musical was revived in 1997 with Sarah Jessica Parker in the role. It was revived again in 2024 with Sutton Foster in the role of Winnifred. A television adaptation of \"The Princess and the Pea\" starred Liza Minnelli in a  Faerie Tale Theatre episode in 1984. The story has been adapted into three films, a six-minute IMAX production in 2001, one full-length animation film in 2002 and the 2005 feature-length movie featuring Carol Burnett and Zooey Deschanel.[1] The tale was the basis for a story in The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales by Jon Scieszka[8] and Lane Smith, wherein the prince decides to slip a bowling ball underneath one hundred mattresses after three years of unsuccessful attempts with the pea. In the morning, the princess comes downstairs and tells the queen, \"This might sound odd but I think you need another mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball.\" satisfying the king and the queen. The princess marries the prince and they live happily, though maybe not entirely honestly, ever after.[9] American poet Jane Shore published a poem, \"The Princess and the Pea\", in the January 1973 issue of Poetry, in which a close dependency between princess and pea is posited: \"I lie in my skin as in an ugly coat: / my body owned by the citizens / who ache and turn whenever I turn / on the pea on which so much depends\" (13-16).[10] Russian writer Evgeny Shvarts incorporates the story, with two other Andersen stories, in his Naked King.[11]\\n A few folk tales feature a boy discovering a pea or a bean assumed to be of great value. After the boy enters a castle and is given a bed of straw for the night he tosses and turns in his sleep, attempting to guard his treasure. Some observers are persuaded that the boy is restless because he is unaccustomed to sleeping on straw and is therefore of aristocratic blood.[1] In the more popular versions of the tale, only one pea is used. However, Charles Boner added in two more peas in his translation of the story upon which Andersen based his tale. Other differences amongst versions can be seen in various numbers of mattresses as well as feather beds.[citation needed] Versions of the story differ based on whether or not the character of the helper is included. The helper, in some cases, tells the princess to pretend she slept badly. In other versions, the helper does not appear at all and the princess decides to lie all on her own.[12] A similar fairy tale, The Pea Test (Die Erbsenprobe), was included by the Brothers Grimm in 1843 at number 182 in the fifth edition of their collection Children\\'s and Household Tales, but was removed from subsequent editions.\\n Princess and the Pea is a children\\'s board game loosely based on \"The Princess and the Pea\", an 1835 fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, in which each player tries to build the highest stack of mattresses before reaching the final space on the board. It was first published by Winning Moves Games USA in 2003 and was republished in 2008 - but is no longer in production. \\n Each player moves their bed across the board, and tried to build the tallest bed by stacking their mattresses as high as possible.[13][14]\\n The gameplay is fairly straightforward. On a player\\'s turn, the roll the die and move their bed forward that many spaces on the board, then perform the action of the space they land on. Actions involve adding mattresses to your bed from the supply, giving away a mattress, taking a mattress from the person with the most, etc. The game ends when one of the players reaches the crown space, the last one on the board. All other players move their beds to the space and the number of mattresses each player has is counted. The player with the most wins. In the case of a tie, the win is shared. \\n Princess Pea from the PBS Kids children’s series Super Why!

Eventually, they decide to run away and become town musicians in the city of Bremen. Contrary to the story\\'s title the characters never arrive in Bremen, as they succeed in tricking and scaring off a band of robbers, capturing their spoils, and moving into their house. It is a story of Aarne–Thompson Type 130 (\"Outcast animals find a new home\").[1]\\n The Brothers Grimm first published this tale in the second edition of Kinder- und Hausmärchen in 1819, based on the account of the German storyteller Dorothea Viehmann (1755–1815).[1]\\n In the story, a donkey, a dog, a cat, and a rooster, all past their prime years in life and usefulness on their respective farms, were soon to be discarded or mistreated by their masters. One by one, they leave their homes and set out together. They decide to go to Bremen, known for its freedom, to live without owners and become musicians there (\"Something better than death we can find anywhere\").\\n On the way to Bremen, they see a lighted cottage; they look inside and see three robbers enjoying their ill-gotten gains. Standing on each other\\'s backs, they decide to scare the robbers away by making a din; the men run for their lives, not knowing what the strange sound is. The animals take possession of the house, eat a good meal, and settle in for the evening.\\n Later that night, the robbers return and send one of their members in to investigate. He sees the cat\\'s eyes shining in the darkness and thinks he is seeing the coals of the fire. The robber reaches over to light his candle. Things happen in quick succession; the cat scratches his face with her claws, the dog bites him on the leg, the donkey kicks him with his hooves, and the rooster crows and chases him out the door. The terrified robber tells his companions that he was beset by a horrible witch who had scratched him with her long fingernails (the cat), a dwarf who has a knife (the dog), a black monster who had hit him with a club (the donkey), and worst of all, a judge calling out from the rooftop (the rooster). The robbers abandon the cottage to the strange creatures who have taken it, where the animals live happily for the rest of their days.\\n In the original version of this story, which dates from the twelfth century, the robbers are a bear, a lion, and a wolf, all animals featured in heraldic devices. When the donkey and his friends arrive in Bremen, the townsfolk applaud them for having rid the district of the terrible beasts. An alternate version involves the animals\\' master(s) being deprived of his livelihood (because the thieves stole his money and/or destroyed his farm or mill) and having to send his or their animals away, unable to take care of them any further. After the animals dispatch the thieves, they take the ill-gotten gains back to their master so he can rebuild. Other versions involve at least one wild, non-livestock animal, such as a lizard, helping the domestic animals out in dispatching the thieves.[2]\\n The tale is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as type ATU 130, \"The Animals in Night Quarters (Bremen Town Musicians)\".[3][4] Folklorists Stith Thompson and Barre Toelken see a deep relation between this type and type ATU 210, \"Cock (Rooster), Hen, Duck, Pin, and Needle on a Journey\".[5][6]\\n Folklorist Antti Aarne proposed an Asian origin for the tale type ATU 130, \"Die Tiere auf der Wanderschaft\" (\"Wandering Animals and Objects\").[7][8]\\n French folklorist Paul Delarue identified two forms of the tale type: a Western one, wherein the animals in exile are always domestic animals (represented by Grimm\\'s tale), and an Eastern one, wherein the characters are \"inferior animals\".[9] This second form is popular in Japan, China, Korea, Melanesia and Indonesia.[10]\\n The story is similar to other AT-130 tales like the German/Swiss \"The Robber and the Farm Animals\", the Norwegian \"The Sheep and the Pig Who Set Up House\", the Finnish \"The Animals and the Devil\", the Flemish \"The Choristers of St. Gudule\", the Scottish \"The Story of the White Pet\", the English \"The Bull, the Tup, the Cock, and the Steg\", the Irish \"Jack and His Comrades\", the Spanish \"Benibaire\", the American \"How Jack Went to Seek His Fortune\" and \"The Dog, the Cat, the Ass, and the Cock\", and the South African \"The World\\'s Reward\".[1]\\n Joseph Jacobs also cited this as a parallel version of the Irish \"Jack and His Comrades\",[11] and the English \"How Jack went to seek his fortune\".[12] Variants also appears in American folktale collections,[13] and in Scottish Traveller repertoires.[14]\\n Variants also appear in tale compilations from Indian, Malay and Japanese sources.\\n The tale has been retold through animated pictures, motion pictures (often musicals), theatre plays and operas.\\n The sculpture of the Town Musicians of Bremen in Bremen, Germany, is the starting point of a tourist attraction, the German Fairy Tale Route (Deutsche Märchenstraße). The German Fairy Tale Route is a popular tourist attraction in Germany that celebrates the country\\'s rich heritage of fairy tales. Beginning in Hanau in Hesse, the birthplace of the Brothers Grimm, and ending in Bremen, the home of the famed Town Musicians of Bremen, this scenic route meanders through various landscapes that inspired many of the tales we still know and love today.\\n Some of the best known adaptations are:', 'Aladdin (/əˈlædɪn/ ə-LAD-in; Arabic: علاء الدين, romanized:\\xa0ʻAlāʼu d-Dīn/ʻAlāʼ ad-Dīn, IPA: [ʕalaːʔ adˈdiːn], ATU 561, \\'Aladdin\\') is a Middle-Eastern folk tale. It is one of the best-known tales associated with One Thousand and One Nights (often known in English as The Arabian Nights), despite not being part of the original text; it was added by the Frenchman Antoine Galland, based on a folk tale that he heard from the Syrian storyteller Hanna Diyab.[1]\\n Known along with Ali Baba as one of the \"orphan tales\", the story was not part of the original Nights collection and has no authentic Arabic textual source, but was incorporated into the book Les mille et une nuits by its French translator, Antoine Galland.[2]\\n John Payne quotes passages from Galland\\'s unpublished diary recording Galland\\'s encounter with a Maronite storyteller from Aleppo, Hanna Diyab.[1] According to Galland\\'s diary, he met with Hanna, who had travelled from Aleppo to Paris with celebrated French traveller Paul Lucas, on March 25, 1709. Galland\\'s diary further reports that his transcription of \"Aladdin\" for publication occurred in the winter of 1709–10. It was included in his volumes ix and x of the Nights, published in 1710, without any mention or published acknowledgment of Hanna\\'s contribution.\\n Payne also records the discovery in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris of two Arabic manuscripts containing Aladdin (with two more of the \"interpolated\" tales). One was written by a Syrian Christian priest living in Paris, named Dionysios Shawish, alias Dom Denis Chavis. The other is supposed to be a copy Mikhail Sabbagh made of a manuscript written in Baghdad in 1703. It was purchased by the Bibliothèque Nationale at the end of the nineteenth century.[3] As part of his work on the first critical edition of the Nights, Iraq\\'s Muhsin Mahdi has shown[4] that both these manuscripts are \"back-translations\" of Galland\\'s text into Arabic.[5][6]\\n Ruth B. Bottigheimer[7] and Paulo Lemos Horta[8][9] have argued that Hanna Diyab should be understood as the original author of some of the stories he supplied, and even that several of Diyab\\'s stories (including Aladdin) were partly inspired by Diyab\\'s own life, as there are parallels with his autobiography.[10]\\n The story is often retold with variations. The following is a précis of the Burton translation of 1885.[11]\\n Aladdin is an impoverished young ne\\'er-do-well, dwelling in \"one of the cities of Ancient China.\" He is recruited by a sorcerer from the Maghreb, who passes himself off as the brother of Aladdin\\'s late father, Mustapha the tailor, convincing Aladdin and his mother of his good will by pretending to set up the lad as a wealthy merchant. The sorcerer\\'s real motive is to persuade young Aladdin to retrieve a wonderful oil lamp (chirag) from a booby-trapped magic cave. After the sorcerer attempts to double-cross him, Aladdin finds himself trapped in the cave. Aladdin is still wearing a magic ring the sorcerer has lent him. When he rubs his hands in despair, he inadvertently rubs the ring and a genie appears and releases him from the cave, allowing him to return to his mother while in possession of the lamp. When his mother tries to clean the lamp, so they can sell it to buy food for their supper, a second far more powerful genie appears who is bound to do the bidding of the person holding the lamp.\\n With the aid of the genie of the lamp, Aladdin becomes rich and powerful and marries Princess Badroulbadour, the sultan\\'s daughter (after magically foiling her marriage to the vizier\\'s son). The genie builds Aladdin and his bride a wonderful palace, far more magnificent than the sultan\\'s.\\n The sorcerer hears of Aladdin\\'s good fortune, and returns; he gets his hands on the lamp by tricking Aladdin\\'s wife (who is unaware of the lamp\\'s importance) by offering to exchange \"new lamps for old\". He orders the genie of the lamp to take the palace, along with all its contents, to his home in the Maghreb. Aladdin still has the magic ring and is able to summon the lesser genie. The genie of the ring is too weak to directly undo any of the magic of the genie of the lamp, but he is able to transport Aladdin to the Maghreb where, with the help of the \"woman\\'s wiles\" of the princess, he recovers the lamp and slays the sorcerer, returning the palace to its proper place.\\n The sorcerer\\'s more powerful and evil brother plots to destroy Aladdin for killing his brother by disguising himself as an old woman known for her healing powers. Badroulbadour falls for his disguise and commands the \"woman\" to stay in her palace in case of any illnesses. Aladdin is warned of this danger by the genie of the lamp and slays the impostor.\\n Aladdin eventually succeeds to his father-in-law\\'s throne.\\n The opening sentences of the story, in both the Galland and the Burton versions, set it in \"one of the cities of China\".[12] On the other hand, there is practically nothing in the rest of the story that is inconsistent with a Middle Eastern setting. For instance, the ruler is referred to as \"Sultan\" rather than \"Emperor\", as in some retellings, and the people in the story are Muslims and their conversation is filled with Muslim platitudes. A Jewish merchant buys Aladdin\\'s wares, but there is no mention of Buddhists, Daoists or Confucians.\\n Notably, ethnic groups in Chinese history have long included Muslim groups, including large populations of Uyghurs, and the Hui people as well as the Tajiks whose origins go back to Silk Road travelers. Islamic communities have been known to exist in the region since the Tang dynasty (which rose to power simultaneously with the prophet Muhammad\\'s career.) Some have suggested that the intended setting may be Turkestan (encompassing Central Asia and the modern-day Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang in Western China).[13] The Arabicized Turkic Kara-Khanid Khanate, which was located in this region and had a strong identification with China, bears a strong resemblance to the setting, their rulers even adopting the Arab title of Sultan, even going so far as to adopt the title of \"Sultan of the East and China\", which was used alongside Turkic titles such as Khan (title) and Khagan; however, chancellors were referred to as Hajib rather than Vizier.\\n For all this, speculation about a \"real\" Chinese setting depends on a knowledge of China that the teller of a folk tale (as opposed to a geographic expert) might well not possess.[14] In early Arabic usage, China is known to have been used in an abstract sense to designate an exotic, faraway land.[15][16]\\n The story of Aladdin is classified in the Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index as tale type ATU 561, \"Aladdin\", after the character.[17][18][19] In the Index, the \"Aladdin\" story is situated next to two similar tale types: ATU 560, The Magic Ring, and ATU 562, The Spirit in the Blue Light.[20][21][22][23] All of these stories deal with a down-on-his-luck and impoverished boy or soldier, who finds a magical item (ring, lamp, tinderbox) that grants his wishes. In this regard, German folklorist Hans-Jörg Uther, in his revision of the international index, published in 2004, remarked that the similarities between the three tale types make it hard to differentiate them.[24] On the other hand, per Stith Thompson\\'s The Folktale, in type 561, the magical item is stolen, but eventually recovered thanks to the use of another magical object.[25] Similarly, Czech scholar Karel Horálek\\xa0[cs] distinguishes the three types in that, in type 560, the hero is helped by animals (the snake gives the ring and the dog and the cat retrieve the stolen object); type 561 does away with the animals, leaving the hero to recover the stolen lamp with the second object, and, finally, type 562 inserts another person that helps the hero.[26]\\n Since its appearance in The One Thousand and One Nights, the tale has integrated into oral tradition.[27] Scholars Ton Deker and Theo Meder located variants across Europe and the Middle East.[28] In addition, according to scholar Kurt Ranke, in Enzyklopädie des Märchens, the \"greatest distribution density\" occurs in Europe and in the Mediterranean region, with variants also collected in the Middle East (Turkey, Israel, Iraq, Yemen, Iran), Central Asia (in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan), India (among the Santal people),[29][30] and in Southeast Asia (Indonesia and the Philippines).[31]\\n The version with three wishes have become a popular variant of the tale, popularized in the 20th century in the West.[32]\\n Adaptations vary in their faithfulness to the original story. In particular, difficulties with the Chinese setting are quite often resolved by giving the story a more typical Arabian Nights background.\\n Sega Sammy have released a line of pachinko machines based on Aladdin since 1989. Sega Sammy have sold over 570,000 Aladdin pachinko machines in Japan, as of 2017[update].[52] At an average price of about $5,000,[53] this is equivalent to approximately $2.85 billion in pachinko sales revenue.', 'Anastasia (from Greek: Ἀναστασία, romanized:\\xa0Anastasía) is a feminine given name of Greek origin, derived from the Greek word anástasis (ἀνάστασις), meaning \"resurrection\".

The story, about a dying child\\'s dreams and hope, was first published in 1845. It has been adapted to various media, including animated, live-action, and VR films as well as television musicals and opera.[1]\\n On a freezing New Year\\'s Eve, a poor young girl, frozen, shivering, bareheaded and barefoot, unsuccessfully tries to sell matches in the street. Afraid to go home because her father would beat her for failing to sell any matches and not earning even a single penny, she huddles in the alley between two houses and lights matches, one by one, to warm herself.\\n In the flame of the matches, she sees a series of comforting visions: a warm iron stove, a lovely roasted goose, and a great glorious Christmas tree. Each vision disappears as its match burns out. In the sky, she sees a shooting star, which her late grandmother had told her meant that someone is on their way to Heaven. In the flame of the next match she sees her late grandmother, the only person that ever treated her with love and kindness. To keep the vision of her grandmother alive as long as possible, the girl lights the entire bundle of matches she has.\\n When the matches are gone, the girl freezes to death in the cold weather, as her grandmother carries her soul to Heaven. The next morning, passers-by find the girl\\'s body with a smile on her face and express pity, but they do not know about the wonderful visions she had seen or how happy she is with her grandmother in Heaven.[2]\\n \"The Little Match Girl\" was first published in December 1845, in Dansk Folkekalender for 1846. The work was re-published as a part of New Fairy Tales (4 March 1848), Second Volume, Second Collection (Nye Eventyr (1848), Andet Bind, Anden Samling), and again 18 December 1849 as a part of Fairy Tales (1850; Eventyr). The work was also published 30 March 1863 as a part of Fairy Tales and Stories (1863), Second Volume (Eventyr og Historier (1863), Andet Bind).[3]', '\"The Wild Swans\" (Danish: De vilde svaner) is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a princess who rescues her 11 brothers from a spell cast by an evil queen. The tale was first published on 2\\xa0October 1838 in Andersen\\'s Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. First Booklet (Eventyr, fortalte for Børn. Ny Samling. Første Hefte) by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark. It has been adapted to various media including ballet, television, and film.\\n It is categorized as an Aarne-Thompson type 451 (\"The Brothers Who Were Turned into Birds\").[1] Other type 451 variants include The Twelve Brothers, The Six Swans, The Seven Ravens, The Twelve Wild Ducks and Udea and her Seven Brothers.[2]\\n In a faraway kingdom, there lives a widowed king with his twelve children: eleven princes and one princess. One day, he decides to remarry, but marries a wicked queen who is a witch. Out of spite, the queen turns her eleven stepsons into magnificent swans who are allowed to temporarily become human only at night and forced to fly by day. When their sister Elisa has reached the age of fifteen, the queen tries to bewitch her—but Elisa\\'s goodness is too strong for this, so the queen has her banished after making her unrecognizable by dirtying her face and ripping her dress. Elisa finds her brothers, who carry Elisa to safety in a foreign land where she is out of the reach of her evil stepmother.\\n There, Elisa is guided by the queen of the fairies to gather stinging nettles in graveyards to knit into shirts that will eventually help her brothers regain their human shapes. Elisa endures painfully blistered hands from nettle stings, and she must also take a vow of silence for the duration of her task, for speaking one word will kill herself and her brothers. The handsome king of another faraway land happens to come across Elisa, who cannot talk, and falls in love with her. He grants her a room in his castle where she continues her knitting. Eventually he proposes to crown her as his queen and wife, and she accepts.\\n However, the archbishop is chagrined because he thinks Elisa is herself a witch, but the king will not believe him. One night Elisa runs out of nettles and is forced to collect more in a nearby church graveyard where the archbishop is watching. Ghoulish spirits that devour the bodies of the dead are also in the churchyard, and the archbishop believes that Elisa is in league with them.  He reports the incident to the king as proof of witchcraft. The statues of the saints shake their heads in protest, but the archbishop misinterprets this sign as confirmation of Elisa\\'s guilt. The archbishop orders Elisa put on trial for witchcraft. She can speak no word in her defense, and is sentenced to death by burning at the stake.\\n The brothers discover Elisa\\'s plight and try to speak to the king but fail, thwarted by the rising sun. Even as the tumbril bears Elisa away to execution, she continues knitting, determined to continue up to the last moment of her life. This enrages the people, who are on the brink of snatching and ripping the shirts into pieces when the swans descend and rescue Elisa. The people interpret this as a sign from Heaven that Elisa is innocent, but the executioner still prepares for the burning. When Elisa finishes the last shirt, she throws the shirts over the swans, and her brothers return to their human forms. The youngest brother has a swan\\'s wing instead of an arm, as Elisa did not have time to finish one sleeve of his shirt. Elisa is now free to speak and tell the truth but faints from exhaustion, so her brothers explain. As they do so, the firewood around Elisa\\'s stake miraculously takes root and bursts into flowers. The king plucks the topmost flower and places it on Elisa\\'s chest. She is revived by the white flower, and the king and Elisa are married.\\n Danish folktale collector Mathias Winther\\xa0[da] collected a similar tale named De elleve Svaner (English: \"The Eleven Swans\"), first published in 1823, from which Andersen probably took inspiration.[3][4][5]', 'Madame Bovary (/ˈboʊvəri/;[1] French: [madam bɔvaʁi]), originally published as Madame Bovary: Provincial Manners (French: Madame Bovary: Mœurs de province [madam bɔvaʁi mœʁ(s) də pʁɔvɛ̃s]), is a novel by French writer Gustave Flaubert, published in 1857. The eponymous character lives beyond her means in order to escape the banalities and emptiness of provincial life.\\n When the novel was first serialized in Revue de Paris between 1 October and 15 December 1856, public prosecutors attacked the novel for obscenity. The resulting trial in January 1857 made the story notorious. After Flaubert\\'s acquittal on 7 February 1857, Madame Bovary became a bestseller in April 1857 when it was published in two volumes. A seminal work of literary realism, the novel is now considered Flaubert\\'s masterpiece, and one of the most influential literary works in history.\\n Charles Bovary is a shy, oddly dressed teenager who becomes an Officier de santé in the Public Health Service. He marries the woman his mother has chosen for him, the unpleasant but supposedly rich widow Héloïse Dubuc. He sets out to build a practice in the village of Tostes.\\n One day, Charles visits a local farm to set the owner\\'s broken leg and meets his patient\\'s daughter, Emma Rouault. Emma is a beautiful, poetically dressed young woman who has a yearning for luxury and romance inspired by reading popular novels. Charles is immediately attracted to her, and when Héloïse dies, Charles waits a decent interval before courting Emma in earnest. Her father gives his consent, and Emma and Charles marry.\\n Emma finds her married life dull and becomes listless. Charles decides his wife needs a change of scenery and moves his practice to the larger market town of Yonville. There, Emma gives birth to a daughter, Berthe, but motherhood proves a disappointment to Emma. She becomes infatuated with Léon Dupuis, a law student who shares Emma\\'s appreciation for literature and music. Emma does not acknowledge her passion for Léon, who departs for Paris to continue his studies.\\n Next, Emma begins an affair with a rich and rakish landowner, Rodolphe Boulanger. After four years, she insists they run away together. Rodolphe does not share her enthusiasm for this plan and on the eve of their planned departure, he ends the relationship with a letter placed at the bottom of a basket of apricots delivered to Emma. The shock is so great that Emma falls deathly ill and  returns to religion.\\n When Emma recovers, she and Charles attend the opera, at Charles\\' insistence, in nearby Rouen. The opera reawakens Emma\\'s passions, and she re-encounters Léon who, now educated and working in Rouen, is also attending the opera. They begin an affair. Emma indulges her fancy for luxury goods and clothes with purchases made on credit from the merchant Lheureux, who arranges for her to obtain power of attorney over Charles\\' estate.\\n When Lheureux calls in Bovary\\'s debt, Emma pleads for money from several people, only to be turned down. In despair, she swallows arsenic and dies an agonizing death. Charles, heartbroken, abandons himself to grief, stops working, and lives by selling off his possessions. When he dies, his young daughter Berthe is placed with her grandmother, who soon dies. Berthe lives with an impoverished aunt, who sends her to work in a cotton mill. The book concludes with the local pharmacist Homais, who had competed with Charles\\' medical practice, gaining prominence among Yonville people and being rewarded for his medical achievements.\\n Emma Bovary is the novel\\'s eponymous protagonist. She has a highly romanticized view of the world and craves beauty, wealth, passion, as well as high society.\\n Charles Bovary, Emma\\'s husband, is a very simple and common man. He is an officier de santé, or \"health officer\".\\n Rodolphe Boulanger is a wealthy local man who seduces Emma as one in a long string of mistresses.\\n Léon Dupuis is a clerk who introduces Emma to poetry and who falls in love with her.\\n Monsieur Lheureux is a sly merchant who lends money to Charles and leads the Bovarys into debt and financial ruin.\\n Monsieur Homais is the town pharmacist.\\n Justin is Monsieur Homais\\' apprentice and second cousin who harbors a crush on Emma.\\n The book was in some ways inspired by the life of a schoolfriend of the author who became a doctor. Flaubert\\'s friend and mentor, Louis Bouilhet, had suggested to him that this might be a suitably \"down-to-earth\" subject for a novel and that Flaubert should attempt to write in a \"natural way,\" without digressions.[2] The writing style was of supreme importance to Flaubert. While writing the novel, he wrote that it would be \"a book about nothing, a book dependent on nothing external, which would be held together by the internal strength of its style\",[3] an aim which, for the critic Jean Rousset, made Flaubert \"the first in date of the non-figurative novelists\", such as James Joyce and Virginia Woolf.[4] Though Flaubert avowed no liking for the style of Balzac, the novel he produced became arguably a prime example and an enhancement of literary realism in the vein of Balzac. The \"realism\" in the novel was to prove an important element in the trial for obscenity: the lead prosecutor argued that not only was the novel immoral, but that realism in literature was an offence against art and decency.[5]\\n The realist movement was, in part, a reaction against romanticism. Emma may be said to be the embodiment of a romantic: in her mental and emotional process, she has no relation to the realities of her world. Although in some ways he may seem to identify with Emma,[6] Flaubert frequently mocks her romantic daydreaming and taste in literature. The accuracy of Flaubert\\'s supposed assertion that \"Madame Bovary, c\\'est moi\" (\"Madame Bovary is me\") has been questioned.[6][7][8] In his letters, he distanced himself from the sentiments in the novel. To Edma Roger des Genettes, he wrote, \"Tout ce que j\\'aime n\\'y est pas\" (\"all that I love is not there\") and to Marie-Sophie Leroyer de Chantepie, \"je n\\'y ai rien mis ni de mes sentiments ni de mon existence\" (\"I have used nothing of my feelings or of my life\").[7] For Mario Vargas Llosa, \"If Emma Bovary had not read all those novels, it is possible that her fate might have been different.\"[9]\\n Madame Bovary has been seen as a commentary on the bourgeoisie, the folly of aspirations that can never be realized or a belief in the validity of a self-satisfied, deluded personal culture, associated with Flaubert\\'s period, especially during the reign of Louis Philippe, when the middle class grew to become more identifiable in contrast to the working class and the nobility. Flaubert despised the bourgeoisie. In his Dictionary of Received Ideas, the bourgeoisie is characterized by intellectual and spiritual superficiality, raw ambition, shallow culture, a love of material things, greed, and above all a mindless parroting of sentiments and beliefs.[10]\\n For Vargas Llosa, \"Emma\\'s drama is the gap between illusion and reality, the distance between desire and its fulfillment\" and shows \"the first signs of alienation that a century later will take hold of men and women in industrial societies.\"[11]\\n Long established as one of the greatest novels, the book has been described as a \"perfect\" work of fiction.[12][13] Henry James wrote: \"Madame Bovary has a perfection that not only stamps it, but that makes it stand almost alone: it holds itself with such a supreme unapproachable assurance as both excites and defies judgment.\"[14] Marcel Proust praised the \"grammatical purity\" of Flaubert\\'s style, while Vladimir Nabokov said that \"stylistically it is prose doing what poetry is supposed to do\".[15] Similarly, in his preface to his novel The Joke, Milan Kundera wrote, \"not until the work of Flaubert did prose lose the stigma of aesthetic inferiority. Ever since Madame Bovary, the art of the novel has been considered equal to the art of poetry.\"[16] Giorgio de Chirico said that in his opinion \"from the narrative point of view, the most perfect book is Madame Bovary by Flaubert\".[17] Julian Barnes called it the best novel that has ever been written.[18]\\n The novel exemplifies the tendency of realism, over the course of the nineteenth century, to become increasingly psychological, concerned with the accurate representation of thoughts and emotions rather than of external things.[19] Thus it prefigures the work of modernist novelists Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce.\\n The book was controversial upon its release: its scandalous subject matter led to an obscenity trial in 1857. Flaubert was acquitted.[20] Le Figaro was negative of the work.[21] They stated, \"Monsieur Flaubert is not a writer.\"[21]\\n Madame Bovary has had the following film and television adaptations:\\n David Lean\\'s film Ryan\\'s Daughter (1970) was a loose adaptation of the story, relocating it to Ireland during the time of the Easter Rebellion. The script had begun life as a straight adaptation of Madame Bovary, but Lean convinced writer Robert Bolt to re-work it into another setting.', 'Heidi (/ˈhaɪdi/; German: [ˈhaɪdi]) is a work of children\\'s fiction published between 1880 and 1881 by Swiss author Johanna Spyri, originally published in two parts as Heidi: Her Years of Wandering and Learning[1] (German: Heidis Lehr- und Wanderjahre) and Heidi: How She Used What She Learned[2] (German: Heidi kann brauchen, was es gelernt hat).[3] It is a novel about the events in the life of a 3-year-old girl in her paternal grandfather\\'s care in the Swiss Alps. It was written as a book \"for children and those who love children\" (as quoted from its subtitle).\\n Heidi is one of the best-selling books ever written and is among the best-known works of Swiss literature.[4][5]\\n In the town of Domleschg lived two brothers. The older wasted the family fortune on drinking and gambling, while the younger ran away to serve in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\\'s Army in Naples. Years later the younger brother returns with a son, Tobias. After Tobias serves an apprenticeship to Mels, father and son move to Dörfli (\\'small village\\' in Swiss German) in the municipality of Maienfeld.  The villagers spread rumors about the father\\'s life in Naples. The man becomes known as The Alm-Uncle, as he lives in seclusion on the mountain Alm. Two village girls, sisters Dete and Adelheid, befriend Tobias. Adelheid and Tobias marry and have a daughter, also named Adelheid but affectionately nicknamed Heidi. Soon after, Tobias is killed in a work accident and Adelheid dies of shock. The Alm-Uncle holds this against God and becomes bitter. \\n Heidi[6] is raised by her maternal grandmother and Dete in Maienfeld. Shortly after the grandmother\\'s death, Dete is offered a job as a maid in the big city, and takes 5-year-old Heidi to live with the Alm-Uncle. He resents Heidi\\'s arrival, but the girl\\'s intelligence and cheerful yet unaffected demeanour soon earn his love. Heidi befriends her new neighbours: young Peter the goatherd, his mother Brigitte, and his blind maternal grandmother. With each season that passes, the mountaintop inhabitants, especially Peter and the grandmother, grow more attached to Heidi, and she to them. However, the grandfather refuses to allow Heidi to attend school, quarrelling with the local pastor and schoolmaster when they try to encourage him to do so, and Heidi is illiterate as a result.\\n Three years later, Dete returns to take Heidi to Frankfurt to be a hired lady\\'s companion to a wealthy girl named Klara Sesemann, who is unable to walk and regarded as an invalid. Klara is charmed by Heidi\\'s simple friendliness and her descriptions of life on the Alm, and delights in all the funny mishaps brought about by Heidi\\'s naïvety and lack of experience with city life, but the Sesemanns\\' strict housekeeper, Fräulein Rottenmeier, views the household disruptions as wanton misbehaviour, and places the free-spirited Heidi under more and more restraint, forbidding her to talk of the Alps or to cry for home. Soon, Heidi becomes terribly homesick for the Alm, and grows alarmingly pale and thin. Her one diversion is learning to read and write using a collection of Biblical stories, motivated by Klara\\'s grandmother Frau Sesemann who shows her trust and affection, and encourages her to believe in God and to pray. Later Frau Sesemann gifts Heidi the book.\\n Heidi\\'s homesickness leads to episodes of sleepwalking where she goes downstairs and opens the front door, which the household initially takes as the work of ghosts.  The family doctor recommends she be sent home before she becomes seriously ill. She gladly returns to the mountains laden with presents for her friends and the book from Frau Sesemann, but finds one of her greatest pleasures is reading hymns to Peter\\'s blind grandmother, who can no longer do so for herself. Her faith in God speaks to something in the Alm-Uncle. One day Heidi reads to him \"The Prodigal Son\" from a book Frau Sesemann gave her. That night Alm-Uncle prays for the first time in years. He accompanies Heidi to church, and that winter takes accommodation in the village so that she can attend school.\\n Heidi and Klara continue to keep in touch and exchange letters. A visit by the doctor to Heidi leads him to recommend that Klara visit Heidi, believing that the mountain environment and the wholesome companionship will do her good. Klara makes the journey the next season and spends a wonderful summer with Heidi, becoming stronger on goat\\'s milk and fresh mountain air. Peter, jealous of Heidi\\'s and Klara\\'s friendship, pushes her empty wheelchair down the mountain.  He is soon wracked with guilt about what he did and ultimately confesses to it. Without her wheelchair, Klara has no choice but to learn to walk; she attempts to do so and is gradually successful. Her grandmother and father are overcome with joy to see Klara walking again. The Sesemann family promises to provide permanent care for Heidi, if there ever comes a time when her grandfather is no longer able to do so.\\n Thirteen English translations were done between 1882 and 1959, by British and American translators: Louise Brooks, Helen B. Dole, H.A. Melcon, Helene S. White, Marian Edwardes, Elisabeth P. Stork, Mabel Abbott, Philip Schuyler Allen, Shirley Watkins, M. Rosenbaum, Eileen Hall, and Joy Law.[7] As of 2010, only the Brooks, Edwardes and Hall translations are still in print.[8] The preface of the 1924 English translation was written by Adeline Zachert.[9]\\n In April 2010, a Swiss scholar named Peter Otto Büttner, uncovered a book written in 1830 by German author Hermann Adam von Kamp entitled Adelaide: The Girl from the Alps (German: Adelaide, das Mädchen vom Alpengebirge).[10] The two stories share many similarities in plotline and imagery.[11] Spyri\\'s biographer Regine Schindler said it was entirely possible that Spyri may have been familiar with the story, as she grew up in a literate household with many books.[citation needed]\\n About 25 film or television productions of the original story have been made. The Heidi films were popular far and wide, becoming a huge hit, and the Japanese animated series became iconic in several countries around the world. The only incarnation of the Japanese-produced animated TV series to reach the English language was a dubbed feature-length compilation film using the most pivotal episodes of the television series, released on video in the United States in 1985. Although the original book describes Heidi as having dark, curly hair, she is usually portrayed as blonde.\\n Versions of the story include:\\n A stage musical adaptation of Heidi with book and lyrics by Francois Toerien, music by Mynie Grové and additional lyrics by Esther von Waltsleben, premiered in South Africa at the Klein Karoo National Arts Festival in 2016. Directed by Toerien with musical direction by Dawid Boverhoff, the production starred Tobie Cronjé (Rottenmeier), Dawid Minnaar (Sesemann), Albert Maritz (Grandfather), Ilse Klink (Aunt Dete), Karli Heine (Heidi), Lynelle Kenned (Klara), Dean Balie (Peter), Jill Middlekop and Marlo Minnaar. Puppets for the production were created by Hansie Visagie.[18]\\n A stage musical adaptation of Heidi of the Mountain (music and lyrics by Claude Watt, book by Claude and Margaret Watt) was performed in Sidney, BC, Canada by Mountain Dream Productions, premiering in 2007 at the Charlie White Theatre, and has been performed again several times since then.[19] The 2007 production starred Claude Watt (Grandfather), Margaret Watt (Rottenmeier), Rianne Craig (Heidi) and Katrina Brindle (Klara).\\n There have been two Heidi computer games released for mobile devices, with the most recent being Heidi: Mountain Adventures. Both games are based on the Studio 100 TV series of 2015 and are aimed at young children, with educational elements and a series of mini-games.[20][21]\\n Heidiland, named after the Heidi books, is an important tourist area in Switzerland, popular especially with Japanese and Korean tourists.[22] Maienfeld is the center of what is called Heidiland; one of the villages, formerly called Oberrofels,[23] is actually renamed \"Heididorf\".[24] Heidiland is located in an area called Bündner Herrschaft; it is criticized as being a \"laughable, infantile cliché\"[22] and \"a more vivid example of hyperreality\".[25]\\n Between 1933 and 1955, French publishing company Flammarion published a new edition of Heidi along with a series of new original sequels. Despite being all published under Johanna Spyri\\'s name, this books were neither written nor endorsed by Spyri, but were adapted from her other works by her French translator, Charles Tritten in the 1930s and 1940s, many years after she died, while the last one was witten by Nathalie Gala.[26][27][28][29] The series is composed of a total of 7 books, 2 translated from Spyri\\'s works and 5 original. Only two of them were published in English.\\n There are some major differences between the original Heidi and the Tritten sequels. These include:\\n In 1990, screenwriters Weaver Webb and Fred & Mark Brogger, and director Christopher Leitch, produced Courage Mountain, starring Charlie Sheen and Juliette Caton as Heidi. Billed as a sequel to Spyri\\'s story, the film is anachronistic in that it depicts Heidi as a teenager during World War I, despite the fact that the original novel (where Heidi is only five years old) was published in 1881.\\n The book has been criticised for black-and-white character portrayals and an idealization of pastoral life.[34][page\\xa0needed]\\n In Japan, since its first Japanese translation in 1906, the book has been influential upon the general, stereotypical image of Switzerland for the Japanese, especially its tourists, many visiting the Heidi\\'s Village park.', 'The Nightmare Before Christmas (also known as Tim Burton\\'s The Nightmare Before Christmas) is a 1993 American Halloween-Christmas gothic stop motion animated musical fantasy film[6] directed by Henry Selick in his feature directorial debut and produced and conceived by Tim Burton. It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of \"Halloween Town\", who stumbles upon \"Christmas Town\" and schemes to take over the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score and provided the singing voice of Jack.[7] The principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O\\'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix and Ed Ivory.\\n The Nightmare Before Christmas originated from a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the critical success of Vincent that same year, Burton began to consider developing the film as either a short film or a half-hour television special, to no avail. Over the years, Burton\\'s thoughts regularly returned to the project, and, in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label because the studio believed the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids\".[1]\\n The Nightmare Before Christmas premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, before its wide theatrical release on October 29. The film was met with commercial and critical success upon release, earning praise for its animation, particularly the innovation of stop-motion as an art form, as well as its characters, songs, and score. While initially a modest box office hit, it has since garnered a large cult following and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time.[8][9][10][11][12] It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film, but lost to Jurassic Park.[13] Thirteen years after its initial release, the film was reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010.\\n In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"[14]\\n Halloween Town is a fantasy world populated by various monsters and supernatural beings. Jack Skellington, the well-respected \"Pumpkin King\", leads the town in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. This year, however, Jack grows tired of the same routine and longs for something new. Upon discovering trees containing doors to other holiday-themed worlds, Jack stumbles through the one leading to Christmas Town and is fascinated by the unfamiliar holiday.\\n Jack returns home and shares his discovery with his friends and neighbors, but they struggle to grasp the concept of Christmas, although there is one character in Christmas Town they can relate to, a mighty lobster-like king, who\\'s known as \"Sandy Claws\". After several futile attempts at finding a way to rationally explain Christmas, Jack decides to \"improve\" the holiday instead. He announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year and assigns Christmas-themed jobs, such as singing carols, making presents and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer, to various residents. \\n Sally, the creation of local mad scientist Doctor Finkelstein, experiences a vision predicting that their efforts will end disastrously. Jack, whom she secretly loves, dismisses her warnings and instructs her to make a Santa Claus suit for him. He also tasks mischievous trick-or-treating trio Lock, Shock and Barrel with abducting Santa; however, he orders them not to involve their superior, Oogie Boogie, a bogeyman with a passion for gambling, in their plot.\\n When Lock, Shock and Barrel bring Santa to Halloween Town, Jack, surprised that he is not the clawed man he expected, tells Santa that he will take care of Christmas this year and orders the trio to keep Santa safe. However, they disobey Jack\\'s orders and bring Santa to Oogie, who plots to play a game with Santa\\'s life at stake. As Jack departs to deliver presents in the real world, Sally attempts to rescue Santa from Oogie, only to be captured herself.\\n Jack\\'s presents terrify the real world\\'s populace, who contact the local authorities and are instructed to lock down their homes for protection. The military is alerted and Jack is shot out of the sky, leading Halloween Town\\'s populace to believe he is dead. Bemoaning the trouble that he has caused, Jack realizes he nonetheless enjoyed the experience, and that it gave him new ideas for celebrating Halloween, reigniting his love for the holiday.\\n Upon returning home, Jack rescues Santa and Sally, then confronts Oogie and defeats him by unraveling a thread holding his cloth form together, causing all of the bugs inside Oogie to spill out and reduce him to nothing. Santa makes amends with Jack and resumes his yearly duties, replacing Jack\\'s presents with genuine ones, while all of Halloween Town celebrates Jack\\'s return. Santa brings a snowfall to the town, thereby bringing the Christmas spirit upon it, while Jack and Sally declare their love for each other.\\n \\n The cast also features Debi Durst, Gregory Proops, Kerry Katz, Randy Crenshaw, Sherwood Ball, Carmen Twillie, Glenn Walters, and John Morris voicing various characters. Patrick Stewart recorded narration for a prologue and epilogue. While not used in the final film, the narration is included on the soundtrack album.[17]\\n As writer Tim Burton\\'s upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. \"Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, […] it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn\\'t there before,\" Burton would later recall.[18] After completing his short film Vincent in 1982,[18] Burton, who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas.[19] Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price,[20] but also considered other options such as a children\\'s book.[21] He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models;[22][23] Burton later showed his and Heinrichs\\' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time.[24] After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special.[22] However, the project\\'s development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed \"too weird\" to the company.[25] As Disney was unable to \"offer his nocturnal loners enough scope\", Burton was fired from the studio in 1984[20] and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice (1988) and Batman (1989) for Warner Bros. Pictures.[25]\\n Over the years, Burton regularly thought about the project. In 1990, Burton found out that Disney still owned the film rights.[26] He and Selick committed to produce a full-length film expanding on the poem\\'s storyline with the latter as director.[24] Burton\\'s own success with live-action films piqued the interest of Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who saw the film as an opportunity to continue the studio\\'s streak of recent successes in feature animation.[27] Disney was looking forward to Nightmare \"to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\"[28] Walt Disney Pictures president David Hoberman believed the film would prove to be a creative achievement for Disney\\'s image, elaborating \"we can think outside the envelope. We can do different and unusual things.\"[27]\\n Nightmare marked Burton\\'s third consecutive film with a Christmas setting. Burton could not direct because of his commitment to Batman Returns, and he did not want to be involved with \"the painstakingly slow process of stop motion\".[24] To adapt his poem into a screenplay, Burton approached Michael McDowell, his collaborator on Beetlejuice. McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences, which convinced Burton to make the film as a musical with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator Danny Elfman. Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two-thirds of the film\\'s songs.[4] Elfman found writing Nightmare\\'s eleven songs to be \"one of the easiest jobs I\\'ve ever had. I had a lot in common with Jack Skellington.\"[22] Caroline Thompson had yet to be hired to write the screenplay.[4] With Thompson\\'s screenplay, Selick stated, \"there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline\\'s. She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting, re-configuring and developing the film visually.\"[29]\\n Selick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California, with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming.[24][30] Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation.[31] At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming.[32] In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film. The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Étienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book.[22][29] In addition, Selick stated, \"When we reach Halloween Town, it\\'s entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it\\'s an outrageous Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the \\'Real World\\', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.\"[33] Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film\\'s prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory.[15] Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film\\'s soundtrack.\\n On the direction of the film, Selick reflected, \"It\\'s as though [Burton] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn\\'t involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job to make it look like \\'a Tim Burton film\\', which is not so different from my own films.\"[29] When asked about Burton\\'s involvement, Selick claimed, \"I don\\'t want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total.\"[29] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with digital effects and some second-layering traditional animation.[24] Burton found production somewhat difficult, because he was simultaneously filming Batman Returns and in pre-production for Ed Wood.[4]\\n The filmmakers constructed 227 puppets to represent the characters in the movie, with Jack Skellington having \"around four hundred heads\", allowing the expression of every possible emotion.[34] Sally\\'s mouth movements \"were animated through the replacement method. During the animation process, […] only Sally\\'s face \\'mask\\' was removed in order to preserve the order of her long, red hair. Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions (e.g. eyes open and closed, and various facial poses) and synchronized mouth movements.\"[35] The stop-motion figurine of Jack was reused in James and the Giant Peach (also directed by Selick) as Captain Jack.[36]\\n The film\\'s soundtrack album was released in 1993 on Walt Disney Records. The film\\'s soundtrack contains bonus tracks, including a longer prologue and an extra epilogue, both narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart. For the film\\'s 2006 re-release in Disney Digital 3-D, a special edition of the soundtrack was released, featuring a bonus disc that contained covers of five of the film\\'s songs by Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, Fiona Apple, and She Wants Revenge. Four original demo tracks by Elfman were also included.[37] On September 30, 2008, Disney released the cover album Nightmare Revisited, featuring artists such as Amy Lee, Flyleaf, Korn, Rise Against, Plain White T\\'s, The All-American Rejects, and many more.[38]\\n American gothic rock band London After Midnight featured a cover of \"Sally\\'s Song\" on their 1998 album Oddities. LiLi Roquelin performed a French cover of \"Sally\\'s Song\" on her album Will you hate the rest of the world or will you renew your life? in 2010. Pentatonix released a cover of \"Making Christmas\" for their 2018 Christmas album Christmas Is Here!.[39]\\n In 2003, the Disneyland Haunted Mansion Holiday soundtrack CD was released. Although most of the album\\'s songs are not original ones from the film, one song is a medley of \"Making Christmas\", \"What\\'s This?\", and \"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\". Other songs included are original holiday songs changed to incorporate the theme of the film. However, the last song is the soundtrack for the Disneyland Haunted Mansion Holiday ride.\\n The Nightmare Before Christmas was originally going to be released under Walt Disney Pictures as part of the Walt Disney Feature Animation lineup (as was advertised as Walt Disney Pictures in the behind the scenes sneak peek on the 1993 VHS release of Pinocchio), but Disney decided to release the film under the studio\\'s adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures banner, because the studio thought the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids,\" Selick remembered. \"Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, [was] they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.\"[40] To convey Burton\\'s involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton\\'s The Nightmare Before Christmas.[27] According to Selick, the decision was made approximately three weeks before the film went into wide release.[41] Burton explained that, \"…it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I\\'m not quite sure about.\"[4] The film made its world premiere on the opening day celebration of the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993,[42] and was given a limited release on October 13, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29, 1993.\\n The Nightmare Before Christmas was reissued under the Walt Disney Pictures label and re-released on October 20, 2006, with conversion to Disney Digital 3-D, and was accompanied by Pixar\\'s short film Knick Knack.[1] Industrial Light & Magic assisted in the process.[31] It subsequently re-released on October 19, 2007, October 24, 2008, and October 23, 2009.[43] The El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California, has been showing the film in 4-D screenings annually in October, ending on Halloween, since 2010.[44] The reissues have led to a reemergence of 3-D films and advances in RealD Cinema.[45][46]\\n In October 2020, The Nightmare Before Christmas was re-released in 2,194 theaters. It grossed $1.3 million over the weekend, finishing fourth behind Tenet.[47] For the film\\'s 30th anniversary and in commemoration of The Walt Disney Company\\'s centennial, it was re-released in theaters across the United States and Canada on October 20, 2023, including engagements in 4DX.[48] The film was once again theatrically re-released on October 11, 2024, including RealD 3D and Disney Digital 3-D formats.\\n With years of successful home video sales, The Nightmare Before Christmas later achieved the ranks of a cult film.[31] Touchstone Home Video first released the film on VHS and LaserDisc (in both deluxe CAV and widescreen editions) on September 30, 1994, and on DVD on December 2, 1997.[49] The Nightmare Before Christmas was released on DVD a second time on October 3, 2000, as a special edition. The release included an audio commentary by Selick and cinematographer Pete Kozachik, a 28-minute making-of documentary, a gallery of concept art, storyboards, test footage and deleted scenes. Burton\\'s Vincent (1982) and Frankenweenie (1984) were also included.[50] Both DVDs were non-anamorphic widescreen releases. The film was released on UMD for PlayStation Portable on October 25, 2005.[51]\\n Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued the DVD (this time with an anamorphic transfer) and on Blu-ray Disc (for the first time) on August 26, 2008, as a two-disc digitally remastered \"collector\\'s edition\", but still containing the same special features.[52][53]\\n Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released The Nightmare Before Christmas on Blu-ray 3D on August 30, 2011. The release included a Blu-ray 3D disc, Blu-ray disc and a DVD that includes both a DVD and digital copy.\\n In 2018, a sing-along version, accompanied by the theatrical cut and a Movies Anywhere copy, as a single-disc version for the film\\'s 25th anniversary.[54] The singalong version was also released on Disney+ on September 30, 2022.\\n In celebration of its 30th anniversary, the film was remastered in 4K and was released on 4K Blu-ray, including extra content, on August 22, 2023.[55][56]\\n Disney has extensively marketed the film and its characters across many forms of media and memorabilia, including action figures, books, games, art crafts, and fashion products. Jack Skellington, Sally, Pajama Jack, and the Mayor have been made into bendable figures,[57] while Jack and Sally even appear in fine art.[58]  Sally has been made into an action figure and a Halloween costume.[59]\\n Various Disneyland and the branching theme parks host attractions featuring Nightmare characters, particularly during Halloween and Christmas seasons. Since 2001, Disneyland has given its Haunted Mansion Holiday attraction a Nightmare Before Christmas theme for the holiday season. It features characters, decorations and music from the film, in addition to Mickey\\'s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party and Mickey\\'s Halloween Party featuring the film\\'s characters.[60] Additionally, Jack hosts the Halloween Screams, HalloWishes, and Not So Spooky Spectacular! fireworks shows at Magic Kingdom (where the host is Ghost Host) and Disneyland (where the host is Jack himself), as well as the Frightfully Fun Parade.[61]\\n Around the release of the film, Hoberman was quoted, \"I hope Nightmare goes out and makes a fortune. If it does, great. If it doesn\\'t, that doesn\\'t negate the validity of the process. The budget was less than any Disney blockbuster so it doesn\\'t have to earn Aladdin-sized grosses to satisfy us.\"[22] The film earned $50 million in the United States in its initial theatrical run[43] and was regarded as a moderate sleeper hit.\\n The Nightmare Before Christmas made an additional $11.1 million in box office gross in its 2006 reissue.[62] The 2007, 2008, 2009, 2020, and 2023 reissues earned $15.8 million, $2.5 million, $2.3 million, and $10 million, respectively[clarification needed], increasing the film\\'s total box office gross to $107.8 million.[43][63] It would also finish in top 10 during the first three-day weekend of its 2024 re-release, grossing $2.4 million.[64][65]\\n On Rotten Tomatoes, The Nightmare Before Christmas holds a rating of 95% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site\\'s critics consensus reads, \"The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stunningly original and visually delightful work of stop-motion animation.\"[66] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[67] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[68]\\n Roger Ebert praised the film\\'s visual inventiveness: \"One of the many pleasures of Tim Burton\\'s The Nightmare Before Christmas is that there is not a single recognizable landscape in it. Everything looks strange and haunting. Even Santa Claus would be difficult to recognize without his red-and-white uniform.\" He wrote that it presented a world \"that is as completely new as the worlds we saw for the first time in such films as Metropolis, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and  Star Wars. What all of these films have in common is a visual richness, so abundant they deserve more than one viewing.\" He wrote that \"The songs by Danny Elfman are fun too, a couple of them using lyrics so clever they could be updated from Gilbert & Sullivan. And the choreography, liberated from gravity and reality, has an energy of its own, as when the furniture,  the architecture, and the very landscape itself gets in on the act.\" He notes that \"some of the Halloween creatures might be a tad scary for smaller children, but this is the kind of movie older kids will eat up; it has the kind of offbeat, subversive energy that tells them wonderful things are likely to happen.\"[69]\\n Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it a restoration of \"originality and daring to the Halloween genre. This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff. … It\\'s 74 minutes of timeless movie magic.\"[70] James Berardinelli stated \"The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone. For the kids, it\\'s a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it\\'s an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance. In short, The Nightmare Before Christmas does what it intends to: entertain.\"[71] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film\\'s similarities to the writings of Oscar Wilde and the Brothers Grimm, as well as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and other German Expressionist films.[72]\\n Michael A. Morrison discusses the influence of Dr. Seuss\\' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! on the film, writing that Jack parallels the Grinch and Zero parallels Max, the Grinch\\'s dog.[73] Philip Nel writes that the film \"challenges the wisdom of adults through its trickster characters\", contrasting Jack as a \"good trickster\" with Oogie Boogie, whom he also compares with Seuss\\' Dr. Terwilliker as a bad trickster.[74] Entertainment Weekly reports that fan reception of these characters borders on obsession, profiling Laurie and Myk Rudnick, a couple whose \"degree of obsession with [the] film is so great that … they named their son after the real-life person that a character in the film is based on.\"[75] This enthusiasm for the characters has also been profiled as having spread beyond North America to Japan.[76] Yvonne Tasker notes \"the complex characterization seen in The Nightmare Before Christmas\".[77]\\n The film was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Nightmare won the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, while Elfman won Best Music. Selick and the animators were also nominated for their work. Elfman was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. Most recently, the film ranked #1 on Rotten Tomatoes\\' \"Top 25 Best Christmas Movies\" list.[78]\\n Blink-182\\'s 2003 song \"I Miss You\" makes reference to the film.[79][80]\\n The third and fourth episodes of the fifth season of Fargo feature a group of characters that wear masks depicting characters from the movie, including Jack Skellington.\\n \\nIn 2003, Disney began to consider producing a sequel, but rather than using stop motion, they wanted to use computer animation.[81] Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. \"I was always very protective of [The Nightmare Before Christmas], not to do sequels or things of that kind,\" Burton explained. \"You know, Jack visits Thanksgiving world or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it, because it\\'s a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it.\"[46] The 2004 video game The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie\\'s Revenge did serve as a sequel of the film, with Capcom\\'s crew of developers going after Burton for advice[82] and having the collaboration of the film\\'s art director, Deane Taylor.[83] In 2009, Selick said he would do a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it.[84]\\n In February 2019, it was reported that a new Nightmare Before Christmas film was in the works with Disney considering either a stop-motion sequel or live-action remake.[85] In October 2019, Chris Sarandon expressed interest on reprising his role as Jack Skellington if a sequel film ever materializes.[86]\\n On February 22, 2021, Disney Publishing announced that a sequel was given to the 1993 film in the form of a young adult novel, released as Long Live the Pumpkin Queen. It was written by Shea Ernshaw and features Sally as the main character, told through her point-of-view, with events taking place after the film.[87] The book was released on August 2, 2022.[88]\\n In October 2023, Selick stated that he would like to do a prequel film about how Jack became king of Halloween Town.[89][90] The following month, however, Burton said that he did not want to see any further projects in that universe.[91] In August 2024, Selick expressed doubt that a sequel would ever materialize, not wanting to \"beat [the film] to death.\"[92]\\n A collectible card game based on the film called The Nightmare Before Christmas TCG was released in 2005 by NECA. The game was designed by Quixotic Games founder Andrew Parks[93] and Zev Shlasinger. It consists of a Premiere set and 4 Starter Decks based on four characters, Jack Skellington, the Mayor, Oogie Boogie, and Doctor Finkelstein. Each Starter Deck contains a rule book, a Pumpkin King card, a Pumpkin Points card, and a 48-card deck. The game has four card types: Characters, Locales, Creations, and Surprises.

It consists of four short films, two feature-length films and has spawned numerous spin-offs and TV adaptations. The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, and Gromit, his loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic beagle. The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was finished and released in 1989. Wallace was voiced by actor Peter Sallis until 2010 when he was succeeded by Ben Whitehead. While Wallace speaks very often, Gromit is largely silent and has no dialogue, communicating through facial expressions and body language.[1]\\n Because of their popularity, the characters have been described as positive international cultural icons of both modern British culture and British people in general. BBC News called them \"some of the best-known and best-loved stars to come out of the UK\".[2] Icons has said they have done \"more to improve the image of the English world-wide than any officially appointed ambassadors\".[3]\\n Park has made pointed references that he was inspired by his childhood through the 1950s and 1960s in Lancashire in Northern England.  Although not overtly set in any particular time – with the 1960s being the optimum time period placement, except for the considerable number of anachronisms – but with very shaky geography, where Wigan is seen at the end of Wallace\\'s alliterative home address on his letters, though his accent comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire and he is especially fond of Wensleydale cheese (from Wensleydale, North Yorkshire).\\n Their films have been widely praised, with the first three short films, A Grand Day Out (1989), The Wrong Trousers (1993) and A Close Shave (1995) earning 100% on Rotten Tomatoes; the feature film Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) has also received acclaim. The feature film is the second-highest-grossing stop-motion animated film, outgrossed by Chicken Run (2000), another creation of Park\\'s. A fourth short film, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was released in 2008. A second full-length feature film, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl — marking the return of the penguin Feathers McGraw, the villain from The Wrong Trousers — will be released in at the end of 2024.[4] The franchise has received numerous accolades, including five British Academy Film Awards, three Academy Awards and a Peabody Award.[5]\\n The first short film, A Grand Day Out, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1991. The short films The Wrong Trousers and A Close Shave followed. The full-length feature The Curse of the Were-Rabbit was released in 2005. The latter three each earned Academy Awards.\\n In January 2007, a five-film deal with DreamWorks and Aardman fell through after three films, due to creative differences, as well as the box office failure of Flushed Away. Park said later that DreamWorks executives wanted to Americanise the very British Wallace and Gromit after test screenings, which would have tarnished some of the duo\\'s nostalgic charm. The fourth Wallace & Gromit short, A Matter of Loaf and Death, was Park\\'s first production since the end of the DreamWorks deal. It was the most-watched television programme in the UK in 2008.[6] A Matter of Loaf and Death won the 2008 BAFTA Award for Best Short Animation and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2010.[7] In 2013, Peter Lord stated that there were no plans at the moment for a new short film, and Park announced in the following year that the declining health of Wallace\\'s voice actor, Peter Sallis, had the possibility of preventing any future films despite the availability of Ben Whitehead.[8]\\n On 4 May 2017, Lord stated that more projects with the characters are likely while speaking at an animation event in Stuttgart, Germany. He said, \"When Nick [Park]\\'s not drawing cavemen, he\\'s drawing Wallace & Gromit ... I absolutely assume he will do another, but not a feature. I think he found it was too much. I think he liked the half-hour format.\"[9]\\n Sallis died on 2 June 2017 at the age of 96.[10] In 2018, Park said to Radio Times: \"[Sallis] was such a special one-off person with such unique qualities, it would be hard to fill his shoes but I think he\\'d want us to carry on and I\\'ve got more Wallace and Gromit ideas.\"[11] In 2019, Park announced that a new Wallace & Gromit project is in development. \"I can\\'t give too much away because it would spoil it really, but it\\'s Wallace & Gromit up to their old antics.\"[12][13] In May 2020, Aardman announced the release of The Big Fix Up, a Wallace & Gromit story in the form of an augmented reality (AR) mobile app. It features the voices of Miriam Margolyes, Isy Suttie and Jim Carter and was released on 18 January 2021.[14][15]\\n In September 2021, a bronze bench statue of Wallace & Gromit was unveiled in Preston, Lancashire, Park\\'s home town.[16] In January 2022, a new film, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, was announced, which is due to release in 2024 on Netflix worldwide, except for the UK where it will debut first on the BBC before also coming to Netflix at a later date.[17]\\n Wallace lives, along with his pet dog Gromit, at 62 West Wallaby Street that is in a part of Wigan in Lancashire.\\n He usually wears brown woollen trousers, a white shirt with detachable sleeves, and a red tie under a green vee-necked knitted sleeveless sweater. He is fond of cheese, especially Wensleydale, with crackers.[18][19]\\n Nick Park, his creator, said: \"He\\'s a very self-contained figure. A very homely sort who doesn\\'t mind the odd adventure.\" He is loosely based on Park\\'s father and Park has never made it clear as to whether Wallace is the character\\'s forename or surname, preferring to leave this ambiguous.[20][21][22]\\n Wallace was voiced by Peter Sallis until his retirement in 2010, being succeeded by Ben Whitehead since 2009.[23][24][25]\\n Wallace is an inveterate inventor, creating elaborate contraptions that often do not work wholly as intended. Their appearance is similar to the illustrations of W. Heath Robinson and Rube Goldberg, where Nick Park has said of Wallace that all his inventions are designed around the principle of using a \"sledgehammer to crack a nut\". Some of Wallace\\'s contraptions are based on real-life inventions. For example, his method of waking up in the morning uses a bed that tips up to wake up its owner, an invention that was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851 by Theophilus Carter.\\n To finance the development of his inventions, Wallace runs independent business ventures to varying levels of success.  He adapts his house with increasingly elaborate contraptions, employing his devices & gadgets in various ways. Each business has a punning name, which reflect those of the titles of the films:\\n While he has shown himself to be skilled to some degree in the businesses he creates, an unexpected flaw in the inventions he uses to assist him in his latest venture or simple, but odd, happenstance ends up being pivotal to the resolution of the story. \\n In the first photo shown on The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, it was revealed that Wallace once had a full head of hair and a very thick moustache with muttonchops. On the photo that shows Gromit\\'s graduation at Dogwarts, he had lost his beard, but still had a little hair, in the form of sideburns just above his ears. In The Wrong Trousers, he still uses a hair-dryer. In A Matter of Loaf and Death, when Wallace is talking to Gromit, a picture is seen behind Gromit of Wallace with a brown beard and brown hair.\\n Wallace has had three romantic interests. The first was wool shop owner Wendolene Ramsbottom,[26] which ended quickly when Wendolene told Wallace that she was allergic to cheese. The second was Lady Campanula Tottington in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, whom Wallace fondly calls \"Totty\". In A Matter of Loaf and Death, Wallace becomes engaged to Piella Bakewell, who turns out to be a serial killer of bakers.[27]\\n \"Gromit doesn\\'t ever say a word, but there has never been a more expressive character (animated or otherwise) to grace our screens.\"\\n —Empire magazine\\'s entry for Gromit placing the dog first in their list of \"the 50 best animated movie characters\".[28] Gromit is a beagle, with a cream-coloured short-hair coat and oversized floppy dark brown ears, who is Wallace\\'s pet dog and best friend.[29] He is very intelligent, having graduated from \"Dogwarts University\" (\"Dogwarts\" being a pun on \"Hogwarts\", the wizard school from the Harry Potter books) with a double first in Engineering for Dogs.[30] He likes knitting, playing chess, reading the newspaper, tea and cooking. His prized possessions include his alarm clock, dog bone, brush, and a framed photo of himself with Wallace. He is very handy with electronic equipment and an excellent aeroplane pilot. He often threatens the plans of the antagonists he and Wallace encounter in their adventures. Sometimes, Gromit ignores Wallace\\'s orders, such as in A Close Shave and Shopper 13, where Wallace orders him to get rid of Shaun, but Gromit does not. Gromit\\'s birthday is 12 February.[31] In The Wrong Trousers, he is seen circling the date on a calendar.\\n Gromit has no visible mouth and expresses himself through facial expressions and body language. Peter Hawkins originally intended to voice Gromit, but Park dropped the idea when he realised how Gromit\\'s thoughts and feelings could be known through movement with some canine noises on rare occasions.[32][33] Many critics believe that Gromit\\'s silence makes him the perfect straight man, with a pantomime expressiveness that drew favourable comparisons to Buster Keaton.[34] He does at times make dog-like noises, such as yelps and growling.[35] According to the fortieth anniversary documentary A Grand Night In: The Story of Aardman, Gromit was originally supposed to be a cat, but the idea was dropped as Park realised that animating a dog was easier.\\n Generally speaking, Gromit\\'s tastes are more in vogue than those of Wallace; this being one of the many ways they contrast with each other as characters. Gromit seems to have a significant interest in encyclopaedic, classical and philosophical literature, and popular culture, including film and music. Electronics for Dogs has been a firm favourite since A Grand Day Out, and in The Wrong Trousers Gromit\\'s bookshelves feature titles such as Kites, Sticks, Sheep, Penguins, Rockets, Bones and Stars, while he is seen reading The Republic, by Pluto (a nod to the Disney character of the same name and a pun on Plato) and Crime and Punishment, by Fido Dogstoyevsky (a pun on Fyodor Dostoyevsky). Gromit\\'s various possessions make extensive use of puns: A Matter of Loaf and Death features \"Pup Fiction\" (Pulp Fiction), \"The Dogfather\" (The Godfather), \"Where Beagles Dare\" (Where Eagles Dare), \"Bite Club\" (Fight Club) and \"The Bone Identity\" (The Bourne Identity) all as book titles, and \"Citizen Canine\" (Citizen Kane) as a film poster. His taste in music has been shown to cover Bach (presumably punning on \"bark\"), \"Poochini\" (a play on Puccini), \"McFlea\" (McFly), \"The Beagles\" (the Beatles) and \"Red Hot Chili Puppies\" (Red Hot Chili Peppers).\\n Gromit gains his own love interest in A Matter of Loaf and Death, when he becomes attached to Fluffles, a poodle. Fluffles reciprocates his affection and joins Wallace and Gromit delivering bread at the end of the film, and the three drive off into the sunset, making a delivery and listening to \"Puppy Love\" (performed, according to the record cover, by \"Doggy Osmond\").\\n NASA named one of its new prototype Mars explorer robots after Gromit in 2005.[36] On 1 April 2007, HMV announced that Gromit would stand in for Nipper for a three-month period, promoting children\\'s DVDs in its UK stores.[37]\\n Although not overtly setting the series in any particular town, Nick Park had previously hinted that its milieu was inspired by thoughts of 1950s Wigan, reinforced by an A–Z Wigan being displayed on Wallace\\'s Anti-Pesto van in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.[38] In The Wrong Trousers, Gromit picks up a letter at the Wallace & Gromit residence addressed to \"62 West Wallaby Street, Wigan\".[38] The address includes a postcode of WG7\\xa07FU, though this does not match any street in Wigan, whose postcodes begin with the letters WN.[39] This address can be seen in the Cracking Contraptions episode \"Shopper 13\".\\n Wallace\\'s accent (voiced by Peter Sallis) comes from the Holme Valley of West Yorkshire.[40]\\n In the Cracking Contraptions episode \"The Soccamatic\", Wallace says to Gromit, \"How do you like my Preston North End soccamatic, Gromit?\". The episode references famous English footballers of the 1950s and \\'60s, including Nobby Stiles, Tom Finney and Bill Shankly (all of whom played for Preston in their careers) as well as Geoff Hurst and Stanley Matthews.\\n The nostalgic quality of Wallace & Gromit\\'s world has been compared to 1950s Beanotown.[41]\\n The Wallace & Gromit films are shot using the stop motion animation technique.[75] After detailed storyboarding, set and plasticine model construction, the films are shot one frame at a time, moving the models of the characters slightly to give the impression of movement in the final film. As is common with other animation techniques, the stop motion animation in Wallace & Gromit may duplicate frames if there is little motion, and in action scenes sometimes multiple exposures per frame are used to produce a faux motion blur. Because a second of film constitutes 24 separate frames, even a short half-hour film like A Close Shave takes a great deal of time to animate. General quotes on the speed of animation of a Wallace & Gromit film put the filming rate at typically around 30 frames per day per animator.[76]\\n Some effects, particularly the fire, smoke and floating bunnies in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, proved impossible to create in stop motion and were rendered by computer animation specialists, MPC film.[77] MPC film studied the set for three months to create clay-like animation to match the stop-motion production. By paying close attention to detail, MPC was able to make the animated bunnies blend in with the clay bunnies. Adding imperfections such as fingerprints along with texture to the animated bunnies helped enhance the effect. MPC\\'s collaboration resulted in over 700 effects to aid the film along with colouring to match the visuals.[77]\\n Most models were destroyed in the 2005 Aardman studio fire, but a set from A Matter of Loaf and Death is presently on display at the We The Curious science centre.[78] The set and several props from the museum featured in The Wrong Trousers survived as well, as they were being kept at the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, West Yorkshire, before the fire occurred.\\n The music featured in every film was written by British film composer Julian Nott. The theme song was used to wake up astronauts aboard space shuttle mission STS-132 in May 2010.[79] It has been suggested on BBC Radio 4\\'s PM that the theme should become the England football supporters\\' song, instead of the main title theme of The Great Escape.[80]\\n A Wallace & Gromit interactive CD-ROM game from 1996, named Wallace & Gromit Fun Pack, was released for the PC, containing the Crackin\\' Compendium with three mini-games based on the three original animated shorts as well as brief video clips. The other program in the Fun Pack the Customise-O-Matic contained wallpapers, screen savers and sounds that could be assigned as system sounds.[81] A sequel Fun Pack 2 was released in 2000 featuring enhanced graphics and two new games as well as a remake of the Great Train Game.\\n The characters were associated with a 144-issue fortnightly digest called Techno Quest, published by Eaglemoss Publications starting in 1997. It was designed to get children interested in science and technology.[82]\\n In 1997, an animated screensaver themed video game entitled Wallace & Gromit Cracking Animator was released. Screensaver games were made by Dibase.[83] Players could create their own multimedia animations through the collation of things like sound effects, sets, characters and props. Players could manipulate the facial movements of characters to synchronise their expressions with dialogue.[84] Players could choose to make their finished creation their screensaver, or choose one of the pre-made screensaver games.[84] The Boston Herald offered a rating of 2.5 stars, noting that creativity is limited.[85]\\n In September 2003, Wallace & Gromit in Project Zoo was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows. This separate story sees the duo take on Feathers McGraw (of The Wrong Trousers) again. Still obsessed with diamonds, he escapes from the penguin enclosure of West Wallaby Zoo, where he was \"imprisoned\" at the end of The Wrong Trousers, and takes over the entire zoo, kidnapping young animals and forcing their parents to work for him, helping him turn the zoo into a diamond mine.\\n In 2005, a video game of The Curse of The Were-Rabbit was released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, following the plot of the film as Wallace and Gromit work as vermin-catchers, protecting customers\\' vegetable gardens from rabbits, using a \"BunGun\".[86] Gameplay for the Project Zoo involve players exclusively controlling Gromit, as Wallace functions as a helper non-player character, but in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, gameplay shifts between the two, and includes two-player cooperative play.[87] Both games were developed by Frontier Developments with the assistance of Aardman, with Peter Sallis reprising his role as Wallace. Project Zoo was published by BAM! Entertainment, while The Curse of the Were-Rabbit was published by Konami.[87]\\n In July 2008, developer Telltale Games announced a new series of episodic video games based on the characters, called Wallace & Gromit\\'s Grand Adventures.[88] The first episode in Grand Adventures, \"Fright of the Bumblebees\", was released on 23 March 2009.[89] The second episode, \"The Last Resort\", was released on 5 May 2009.[90] Two more episodes, \"Muzzled!\" and \"The Bogey Man\", were released in later 2009. The four episodes have separately been released on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360.\\n On 25 July 2024, a Wallace & Gromit-themed course was added to the virtual reality game Walkabout Mini Golf as downloadable content.[91]\\n There are also several interactive games on the official Wallace & Gromit, Shaun the Sheep and Timmy Time websites.\\n British publisher Titan Magazines started producing a monthly Wallace & Gromit comic after the debut of Curse of the Were-Rabbit. The characters still run Anti-Pesto, and both Shaun and Feathers McGraw have appeared in the comic.[94]\\n The two characters appeared in the monthly BeanoMAX comic until its closure in June 2013, and now appear every four weeks in The Beano.[95] They are heavily featured in \\'Aardmag\\', the free online magazine that is unofficial but supported by Aardman Animations.[96] Nick Park guest-edited the 70th birthday issue of The Beano weekly, and so this issue contained numerous Wallace & Gromit references.[97]\\n On 17 May 2010, they began appearing daily in The Sun.[98] It is credited to Titan and Aardman, with scripts written by Richy Chandler, Robert Etherington, Mike Garley, Ned Hartley, Rik Hoskin, David Leach, Luke Paton, J.P. Rutter, Rona Simpson and Gordon Volke, art by Sylvia Bennion, Jay Clarke, Jimmy Hansen, Viv Heath, Mychailo Kazybrid and Brian Williamson. It replaced George and Lynne. A graphic novel compiling all 311 daily strips was released on 8 October 2013, and a second volume followed on 4 November 2014.[99] A third volume was released on 25 March 2015,[100] and a fourth volume was released on 9 September 2015.[101]\\n In November 1997 the characters appeared in a play called Wallace And Gromit™ Alive on Stage in a Grand Night Out.[102]\\n On 9 March 2011, Shaun the Sheep made its live theatre début in Shaun\\'s Big Show.[103] The 100-minute-long musical/dance show features all the regular characters, including Bitzer, Shirley and Timmy.\\n In 2015, Shaun starred in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs pantomime at Bristol Hippodrome.[104]\\n In 2003, Aardman produced a cinematic commercial for the Renault Kangoo starring Wallace and Gromit. The ad played in front of several summer blockbusters in top British cinemas. The commercial, entitled \"The Kangoo-matic\", was Wallace & Gromit\\'s first advertisement. Later Wallace & Gromit commercials were made for Jacob\\'s Cream Crackers, energy supplier Npower and beverage PG Tips.\\n The duo were used to promote a Harvey Nichols store that opened in Bristol (where Aardman is based) in 2008. The pictures show them, and Lady Tottington from Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, wearing designer clothes and items.[105] They were used to prevent a Wensleydale cheese factory from shutting down because of financial difficulties after a member of staff came up with the idea of using Wallace and Gromit as mascots, as Wensleydale is one of Wallace\\'s favourite cheeses.[18][106]\\n On 28 March 2009, The Science Museum in London opened an exhibition called \"Wallace & Gromit present a World of Cracking Ideas\". The family-orientated show, open until 1 November 2009,[107] hoped to inspire children to be inventive.[108] Wallace and Gromit were featured in many exhibition-exclusive videos, as well as one announcing the opening of the exhibition.[107]\\n In December 2010, Wallace and Gromit featured on series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail for Christmas.[109] The same month, Nick Park appeared on BBC Radio 4\\'s Desert Island Discs and announced that he was working with Blackpool Pleasure Beach to build a theme park ride based on the characters.[110] Wallace & Gromit\\'s Thrill-O-Matic dark ride was opened by Park at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in 2013.[111]\\n Wallace and Gromit appeared in a one-minute special for the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II called Jubilee Bunt-a-thon.[112][113] In 2012, Wallace and Gromit featured on an advert saying \"Inventing For Britain\" which was part of a poster campaign to promote British trade and business aboard in the year they hosted the Olympics.\\n In August 2012, they presented an edition of The BBC Proms, Wallace & Gromit\\'s Musical Marvels, as Prom 20 of the 2012 season.[114] Because of its popularity, Wallace & Gromit\\'s Musical Marvels became a full touring show in 2013. It premièred at The Plenary in Melbourne, Australia on 9 February 2013. It was performed at other venues throughout 2013, with A Matter of Loaf and Death screened at each performance.[115]\\n In 2013 and 2014 the pair appeared in a nationwide TV, press and cinema campaign promoting the British government\\'s \"Holidays at Home are Great\" directive, called Wallace & Gromit\\'s Great UK Adventure.[116]\\n In December 2019, they appeared in a DFS advert created by Krow to celebrate their 30th anniversary. Helena Bonham Carter reprised her role as Lady Tottington with new dialogue for this advert.[117]\\n Wallace & Gromit spearheaded the fundraising for two children\\'s charities,[118] Wallace & Gromit\\'s Children\\'s Foundation,[119] which supports children\\'s hospices and hospitals in the United Kingdom, and Wallace & Gromit\\'s Grand Appeal,[120] the Bristol Children\\'s Hospital Charity. In July 2013, 80 giant fibreglass decorated sculptures of Gromit were distributed around Bristol as part of a Nick Park-inspired project to raise funds for the charity. The project is named Gromit Unleashed and sculptures were decorated by a range of artists and celebrities, including Joanna Lumley, Sir Peter Blake, Trevor Baylis and Jools Holland.[121] A similar project featuring Shaun the Sheep called Shaun in the City was in 2015.[122] A third was placed in 2018 called Gromit Unleashed 2, also featuring Wallace & Shaun. In 2020 Gromit Unleashed: The Grand Adventure will be in The Mall, Cribbs Causeway featuring 15 sculptures of Wallace, Gromit, Shaun and Feathers.[123] On  23 August 2023 a fourth trail was announced, the trail in Bristol will run in 2025.[124]\\n A theme park ride called Wallace & Gromit\\'s Thrill-O-Matic opened at Blackpool Pleasure Beach on 29 April 2013 by creator Nick Park, Amanda Thompson, Nick Thompson, Nick Farmer and Merlin Crossingham.\\n The ride, which cost £5.25\\xa0million to make, was created by Blackpool Pleasure Beach design in association with Aardman Animations. The cars on the ride are designed on one of Wallace\\'s slippers, so that, when a rider is seated, it is as if they are sitting inside a large slipper. The ride lasts almost four minutes, and features scenes from A Grand Day Out, The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and A Matter of Loaf and Death along with some archive audio and some newly recorded lines from Ben Whitehead as the voice of Wallace.[125]\\n In 2007, a spin-off series Shaun the Sheep was created for the character of Shaun, first introduced in 1995\\'s A Close Shave. In the series, Shaun lives with his flock at Mossy Bottom Farm, a traditional small northern English farm. In each episode, their latest attempt to add excitement to their dull mundane life as livestock somehow snowballs into a fantastic sitcom-style escapade, most often with the help of their fascination with human doings and devices. This usually brings them into conflict—and often into partnership—with the farm sheepdog Bitzer, while they all are simultaneously trying to avoid discovery by the Farmer. Following the success of the series, two series of 1-minute shorts were created – Mossy Bottom Shorts and Championsheeps—followed by a television special The Farmer\\'s Llamas (2015) and two feature films, Shaun the Sheep Movie (2015) and A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon (2019).\\n In 2009, a spin-off of Shaun the Sheep, Timmy Time, was created centring on the character of the same name. In the series, Timmy and his friends[126] have to learn to share, make friends and accept their mistakes.[127] They are supervised by two teachers, Harriet the Heron and Osbourne the Owl. The show is aimed at pre-school-aged children which the company described as \"a natural step for Aardman\".[128]', 'Chicken Run is a 2000 animated adventure comedy film[9] produced by Pathé and Aardman Animations in partnership with DreamWorks Animation.[10][11] Aardman\\'s first feature-length film, it was directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (in their feature-length directorial debuts) from a screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick and based on an original story by Lord and Park.[12] The film stars the voices of Julia Sawalha, Mel Gibson, Tony Haygarth, Miranda Richardson, Phil Daniels, Lynn Ferguson, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, and Benjamin Whitrow. Set in the countryside of Yorkshire, the plot centres on a group of British anthropomorphic chickens who see an American rooster named Rocky Rhodes as their only hope to escape the farm when their owners want to turn them into chicken pies.\\n Chicken Run was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $220 million and becoming the highest-grossing stop-motion animated film in history. At the time, this film was DreamWorks Animation\\'s most successful release, but this was overtaken by Shrek the following year.[13]\\n 23 years later, a sequel, titled Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, was released on Netflix on 15 December 2023.[14] Its Netflix release followed its world premiere at the 67th BFI London Film Festival on 14 October 2023, which would also see preview screenings taking place at UK cinemas at the same time.[15]\\n In the countryside of Yorkshire,[16] a flock of chickens live on an egg farm structured like a prisoner-of-war camp. The farm is run by the cruel Mrs Tweedy and her submissive husband, Mr Tweedy, who kill and eat any chicken that is no longer able to lay eggs. Led by the rebellious Ginger, the chickens constantly devise new ways to try to escape but are always caught. Mr Tweedy suspects the chickens are organised and plotting resistance, but his wife dismisses his theories while being frustrated with making minuscule profits.\\n One night, Ginger witnesses an American rooster named Rocky Rhodes glide over the coop\\'s fences and crash-land; the chickens put his sprained wing in a cast and hide him from the Tweedys, who have been promised a handsome reward by Rocky\\'s owner for his return. Inspired by Rocky\\'s apparent flying abilities, Ginger begs him to help teach her and the other chickens to fly so they can escape, threatening to alert the humans if he refuses. Rocky reluctantly gives them training lessons. One evening, a load of equipment is delivered to the farm, containing the parts for a chicken pie machine that Mrs Tweedy has ordered as part of a plan to convert the farm into a profitable pie-making factory. When the Tweedys increase the chickens\\' food rations and ignore the decline in egg production, Ginger deduces that the couple\\'s new plan is to fatten the chickens for slaughter. After Ginger and Rocky get into an argument, Rocky holds a morale-boosting dance party during which it is revealed that his wing is healed. Ginger insists that he demonstrate flying the next day, but Mr Tweedy finishes assembling the machine and puts Ginger in it for a test run. Rocky saves her and sabotages the machine, buying them time to warn the chickens and plan an escape from the farm.\\n The next day, Ginger finds Rocky has left, leaving behind part of a poster that shows that he is in fact part of a \"chicken cannonball\" act with no ability to fly on his own, making them realize that their chance to learn how to fly has been crushed. In the midst of being devastated, Ginger is inspired by elderly rooster Fowler\\'s stories of his time in the Royal Air Force to build an aircraft to flee the farm. The chickens assemble parts for the plane as Mr Tweedy fixes the pie-making machine. Meanwhile, Rocky comes across a billboard advertising Mrs Tweedy\\'s chicken pies and returns to the farm out of guilt.\\n Mrs Tweedy orders Mr Tweedy to gather all the chickens for the machine, but the chickens subdue him and finish the plane, which Ginger persuades Fowler to pilot. As the plane approaches the take-off ramp, Mr Tweedy is able to knock over the ramp before being knocked out; Ginger races to reset the ramp, but a now-alerted Mrs Tweedy attacks her. Before Mrs Tweedy can hurt Ginger, Rocky returns and subdues her, before holding up the ramp with Ginger, allowing the plane to take flight. Rocky and Ginger grab onto the runway lights, which have been snagged by the departing plane. An axe-wielding Mrs Tweedy follows them by climbing up the lights, but Ginger tricks Mrs Tweedy into cutting the line, sending her falling into the pie machine, causing it to explode in a mushroom cloud of gravy.\\n The chickens celebrate their victory after defeating the Tweedys while Ginger and Rocky kiss each other, and they fly to an island bird sanctuary where they make their home. Sometime later, the chickens have settled into their new home, and Rocky and Ginger have started a romantic relationship. Nick and Fetcher, two rats that have been helping the chickens throughout the escape, decide to set up their own egg farm, but they fall into a circular debate over whether they must use a chicken or egg to start it.\\n Chicken Run was first conceived in 1995 by Aardman co-founder Peter Lord and Wallace and Gromit creator Nick Park. According to Park, the project started as a spoof on the 1963 film The Great Escape.[17] Chicken Run was Aardman Animations\\' first feature-length production, which would be executive produced by Jake Eberts. Nick Park and Peter Lord, who run Aardman, directed the film,[18] while Karey Kirkpatrick scripted, with additional input from Mark Burton[citation needed] and John O\\'Farrell.[citation needed]\\n When a chicken speaks, each sound corresponds to a different beak that was placed on the character.[19]\\n Pathé agreed to finance the film in 1996, putting their finances into script development and model design. DreamWorks officially came on board in 1997.[4][20] They beat out studios including Disney, 20th Century Fox (which had distributed the Wallace & Gromit shorts in the U.S.), and Warner Bros. and largely won due to the perseverance of DreamWorks co-chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg; as a company they were eager to make their presence felt in the animation market in an attempt to compete with Disney\\'s dominance of the field.[4] Katzenberg explained that he had \"been chasing these guys for five or six years, ever since I first saw Creature Comforts.\"[4] DreamWorks secured their first animated feature with the film, and they handled distribution in all territories except Europe, which Pathé handled.[4] The two studios co-financed the film.[4] DreamWorks also retains rights to worldwide merchandising.[4]\\n Principal photography began on 29 January 1998. During production, 30 sets were used with 80 animators working along with 180 people working overall. The result was one minute of film completed for each week of filming, and production wrapped on 18 June 1999.[20]\\n John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams composed the music for the film, which was released on 20 June 2000 under the RCA Victor label.[21][22][23] It was recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London.[24] Powell incorporated some kazoos and whistles to create an even funnier soundtrack.\\n The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 97% approval rating and an average rating of 8.1/10, based on 174 reviews. The website\\'s critics consensus reads: \"Chicken Run has all the charm of Nick Park\\'s Wallace & Gromit, and something for everybody. The voice acting is fabulous, the slapstick is brilliant, and the action sequences are spectacular.\"[25] At Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[26] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[27]\\n Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave three and a half stars out of four, writing: \"So it truly is a matter of life and death for the chickens to escape from the Tweedy Chicken Farm in Chicken Run, a magical new animated film that looks and sounds like no other. Like the otherwise completely different Babe, this is a movie that uses animals as surrogates for our hopes and fears, and as the chickens run through one failed escape attempt after another, the charm of the movie wins us over.\"[28]\\n Chicken Run and its sequel have been noted for their depiction of feminism,[29][30][31][32] revolution,[29][30] Marxism,[33][29][34] veganism[35] and fascism.[36] According to Florentine StrzeIczyk, Chicken Run points to the way that masculinity and femininity are mediated in popular film genres.[36] It also received attention for its female-led cast. Film School Rejects called the movie feminist, noting that \"the stereotypical \\'woman\\'s work\\' of these female chickens (such as their sewing and knitting) is crucial in constructing their mechanism for escape and vital towards the revolution itself.\"[30] The Islamic Republic of Iran News Network argued it was a way to disguise Zionism[37] and Western propaganda.[31][37]\\n On opening weekend, the film grossed $17,506,162 for a $7,027 average from 2,491 theatres. Overall, the film placed second behind Me, Myself & Irene.[38][39] In its second weekend, the film held well as it slipped only 25% to $13,192,897 for a $4,627 average from expanding to 2,851 theatres and finishing in fourth place.[40] The film\\'s widest release was 2,953 theatres, after grossing $106,834,564 in the United States and Canada. In the United Kingdom, it was the third highest-grossing film of the year with a gross of $43 million.[41] With an additional $75 million from other markets, it grossed $224,834,564 worldwide. Produced on an estimated budget of $42–45 million, the film was a huge box office hit. To date, it is still the highest grossing stop motion animated movie.\\n Chicken Run was released on VHS and DVD in the United States on November 21, 2000 by DreamWorks Home Entertainment.[60]\\n Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released Chicken Run on Blu-ray in North America on January 22, 2019.[61]\\n In January 2022, the title for the sequel was revealed as Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget and was announced for a 2023 release on Netflix.[62][63][64] Zachary Levi, Thandiwe Newton, Romesh Ranganathan and Daniel Mays were revealed to be replacing Gibson, Sawalha, Spall and Daniels as the voices of Rocky, Ginger, Nick and Fetcher; David Bradley voiced Fowler due to Whitrow\\'s death in 2017, while Horrocks, Staunton and Ferguson reprised their roles as Babs, Bunty and Mac.[65] Bella Ramsey has been cast as Molly, while Nick Mohammed and Josie Sedgwick-Davies voiced two new characters, Dr Fry and Frizzle, respectively. Sam Fell directed with Steve Pegram and Leyla Hobart producing. Kirkpatrick and O\\'Farrell wrote the script with Rachel Tunnard.[65] In June 2023, Gregson-Williams was revealed to be composing the sequel.[66] Later that month, it was officially announced that the film would release on Netflix on 15 December 2023.[67] Its Netflix release followed its world premiere at the 67th BFI London Film Festival on 14 October 2023, which would also see preview screenings taking place at UK cinemas at the same time.[15]\\n Chicken Run is a stealth-based 3-D platformer based on the movie. It was released in November 2000 on most consoles. The game is a loose parody of the film The Great Escape, which is set during World War II.[68]', 'Madagascar,[a] officially the Republic of Madagascar,[b] is an island country comprising the island of Madagascar and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Lying off the southeastern coast of Africa, it is the world\\'s fourth largest island, the second-largest island country and the 46th largest country in the world.[14] Its capital and largest city is Antananarivo.\\n Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from Africa during the Early Jurassic, around 180 million years ago, and split from the Indian subcontinent around 90\\xa0million years ago,[15] allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation; consequently, it is a biodiversity hotspot and one of the world\\'s 17 megadiverse countries, with over 90% of wildlife being endemic. The island has a subtropical to tropical maritime climate. Madagascar was first permanently settled during or before the mid-first millennium AD by Austronesian peoples,[16] presumably arriving on outrigger canoes from present-day Indonesia.[17][18][19] These were joined around the ninth century AD by Bantu groups crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa.[20] Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. Consequently, there are 18 or more classified peoples of Madagascar, the most numerous being the Merina of the central highlands.\\n Until the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of it was united and ruled as the Kingdom of Madagascar by a series of Merina nobles. The monarchy was ended in 1897 by the annexation by France, from which Madagascar gained independence in 1960. The country has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics, and has been governed as a constitutional democracy since 1992. Following a political crisis and military coup in 2009, Madagascar underwent a protracted transition towards its fourth and current republic, with constitutional governance being restored in January 2014.\\n Madagascar is a member of the United Nations (UN), the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. Christianity is the country\\'s predominant religion, with a significant minority still practising traditional faiths. Madagascar is classified as a least developed country by the UN.[21] Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health and private enterprise, are key elements of its development strategy. Despite substantial economic growth since the early 2000s, income disparities have widened, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the population. As of 2021, 68.4 percent of the population is considered to be multidimensionally poor.[22]\\n In the Malagasy language, the island of Madagascar is called Madagasikara (Malagasy pronunciation: [madaɡasʲˈkʲarə̥]) and its people are referred to as Malagasy.[23][24] The origin of the name is uncertain,[25] and is likely foreign, having been propagated in the Middle Ages by Europeans.[26] If this is the case, it is unknown when the name was adopted by the inhabitants of the island. No single Malagasy-language name predating Madagasikara appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities had their name for part or all of the lands they inhabited.[27]\\n One hypothesis relates Madagascar to the word Malay, referring to the Austronesian origin of the Malagasy people in modern-day Indonesia. In a map by Muhammad al-Idrisi dating from the year 1154, the island is named Gesira Malai, or \"Malay island\" in Arabic. The inversion of this name to Malai Gesira, as it was known by the Greeks, is thought to be the precursor of the modern name of the island.[28] The name \"Malay island\" was later rendered in Latin as Malichu, an abbreviated form of Malai Insula, in the medieval Hereford Mappa Mundi as the name of Madagascar.[29][28]\\n Another hypothesis is that Madagascar is a corrupted transliteration of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia and an important medieval Indian Ocean port. This would have resulted from 13th-century Venetian explorer Marco Polo confusing the two locations in his memoirs, in which he mentions the land of Madageiscar to the south of Socotra. This name would then have been popularized on Renaissance maps by Europeans.[26][27] One of the first documents written that might explain why Marco Polo called it Madagascar is in a 1609 book on Madagascar by Jerome Megiser.[30][31] Jerome Megiser describes an event in which the kings of Mogadishu and Adal traveled to Madagascar with a fleet of around twenty-five thousand men in order to invade the wealthy islands of Taprobane and Sumatra. However, a tempest threw them off course and they landed on the coasts of Madagascar, conquering the island and signing a treaty with its inhabitants. They remained for eight months and erected at different points of the island eight pillars on which they engraved \"Magadoxo\", a name which later, by corruption became Madagascar.[30][31][32][33] Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, a Dutch traveler who copied Portuguese works and maps, confirmed this event by saying \"Madagascar has its name from \\'makdishu\\' (Mogadishu)\" whose \"shayk\" invaded it.[30][34]\\n The name Malagasikara, or Malagascar, is also historically attested. A British state paper in 1699 records the arrival of eighty to ninety passengers from \"Malagaskar\" to what would eventually become New York City.[35] An 1882 edition of the British newspaper The Graphic referred to \"Malagascar\" as the name of the island, stating that it is etymologically a word of Malay origin, and may be related to the name of Malacca.[36] In 1891, Saleh bin Osman, a Zanzibari traveler, refers to the island as \"Malagaskar\" when recounting his journeys, including as part of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition.[37] In 1905, Charles Basset wrote in his doctoral thesis that Malagasikara was the way the island is referred to by its natives, who emphasized that they were Malagasy, and not Madagasy.[38]\\n Traditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves in outrigger canoes from South Borneo, possibly throughout the period between 350\\xa0BC and 550\\xa0AD, while others are cautious about dates earlier than AD 250. In either case, these dates make Madagascar one of the most recent major landmasses on Earth to be settled by humans, predating the settlement of Iceland and New Zealand.[39] It is proposed that Ma\\'anyan people were brought as laborers and slaves by Javan and Sumatran-Malays in their trading fleets to Madagascar.[40][41][42][43] Dates of settlement of the island earlier than the mid-first millennium AD are not strongly supported.[16] However, there is scattered evidence for much earlier human visits and presence. (See History of Madagascar).[44][45] Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 BCE.[46][47][48]\\n Upon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar\\'s abundance of megafauna,[49] including 17 species of giant lemurs, the large flightless elephant birds (including possibly the largest bird to ever exist, Aepyornis maximus), the giant fossa, and several species of Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct because of hunting and habitat destruction.[50] By 600\\xa0AD, groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands.[51]\\n Arab traders first reached the island between the 7th and 9th centuries.[52] A wave of Bantu-speaking migrants from southeastern Africa arrived around the year 1000.[53] Around this time, zebu from South India were first brought, intermingling with sanga found in East Africa.[54] Irrigated paddy fields were developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later.[51] The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century.[55]\\n The oral histories of the Merina people, who arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1,000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo, and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries.[56] Today, the spirits of the Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.[57]\\n The written history of Madagascar began with the Arabs, who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced Islam, the Arabic script (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as sorabe), Arab astrology, and other cultural elements.[58]\\n European contact began in 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island, while participating in the 2nd Armada of the Portuguese India Armadas.[8]\\n Matatana was the first Portuguese settlement on the south coast, 10\\xa0km west of Fort Dauphin. In 1508, settlers there built a tower, a small village, and a stone column. This settlement was established in 1513 at the behest of the viceroy of Portuguese India, Jeronimo de Azevedo.[59]\\n Contacts continued from the 1550s. Several colonization and conversion missions were ordered by King João III and by the Viceroy of India, including one in 1553 by Baltazar Lobo de Sousa. In that mission, according to detailed descriptions by chroniclers Diogo do Couto and João de Barros, emissaries reached the inland via rivers and bays, exchanging goods and even converting one of the local kings.[60]\\n The French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.[58] From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar gained prominence among pirates and European traders, particularly those involved in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The small island of Nosy Boroha off the northeastern coast of Madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of Libertalia.[61] Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.[62] European accounts until the early 20th century identified Malagasy people as being of Jewish origin.[63]\\n The wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island, some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century.[64] Among these were the Betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the Sakalava chiefdoms of Menabe and Boina on the west coast. The Kingdom of Imerina, located in the central highlands with its capital at the royal palace of Antananarivo, emerged at around the same time under the leadership of King Andriamanelo.[65]\\n Upon its emergence in the early 17th century, the highland kingdom of Imerina was initially a minor power relative to the larger coastal kingdoms[65] and grew even weaker in the early 18th century when King Andriamasinavalona divided it among his four sons. Following almost a century of warring and famine, Imerina was reunited in 1793 by King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810).[66] From his initial capital Ambohimanga,[67] and later from the Rova of Antananarivo, this Merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighbouring principalities. His ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor, King Radama I (1810–28), who was recognized by the British government as King of Madagascar. Radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of Mauritius to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance. Artisan missionary envoys from the London Missionary Society began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as James Cameron, David Jones and David Griffiths, who established schools, transcribed the Malagasy language using the Roman alphabet, translated the Bible, and introduced a variety of new technologies to the island.[68]\\n Radama\\'s successor, Queen Ranavalona I (1828–61), responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of Christianity in Madagascar and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. William Ellis of the London Missionary Society described his visits made during her reign in his book Three Visits to Madagascar during the years 1853, 1854, and 1856. The Queen made heavy use of the traditional practice of fanompoana (forced labor as tax payment) to complete public works projects and develop a standing army of between 20,000 and 30,000 Merina soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand the Kingdom of Merina to encompass most of Madagascar. Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory. Between 1828 and 1861, the tangena ordeal caused about 3,000 deaths annually. In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina died as a result of the tangena ordeal, constituting roughly 20 percent of the population.[69] The combination of regular warfare, disease, difficult forced labor, and harsh measures of justice resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign; the population of Madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5\\xa0million to 2.5\\xa0million between 1833 and 1839.[70]\\n Among those who continued to reside in Imerina were Jean Laborde, an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy, and Joseph-François Lambert, a French adventurer and slave trader, with whom then-Prince Radama II signed a controversial trade agreement termed the Lambert Charter. Succeeding his mother, Radama II attempted to relax the queen\\'s stringent policies but was overthrown two years later by Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony and an alliance of Andriana (noble) and Hova (commoner) courtiers, who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch.[58]\\n Following the coup, the courtiers offered Radama\\'s queen, Rasoherina, the opportunity to rule, if she would accept a power-sharing arrangement with the Prime Minister: a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them.[71] Queen Rasoherina accepted, first marrying Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and marrying his brother, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, who would go on to marry Queen Ranavalona II and Queen Ranavalona III in succession.[72] Over the course of Rainilaiarivony\\'s 31-year tenure as prime minister, numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government.[73] Schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory. Army organization was improved and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers.[74] Polygamy was outlawed and Christianity declared the official religion of the court in 1869, was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace.[73] Legal codes were reformed on the basis of British common law and three European-style courts were established in the capital city.[74] In his joint role as Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of Madagascar against several French colonial incursions.[74]\\n Primarily on the basis that the Lambert Charter had not been respected, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first Franco-Hova War.[75] At the end of the war, Madagascar ceded the northern port town of Antsiranana (Diego Suarez) to France and paid 560,000 francs to Lambert\\'s heirs.[76] In 1890, the British accepted the full formal imposition of a French protectorate on the island, but French authority was not acknowledged by the government of Madagascar. To force capitulation, the French bombarded and occupied the harbor of Toamasina on the east coast, and Mahajanga on the west coast, in December 1894 and January 1895 respectively.[77]\\n A French military flying column then marched toward Antananarivo, losing many men to malaria and other diseases. Reinforcements came from Algeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. Upon reaching the city in September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender.[78] Popular resistance to the French capture of Antananarivo—known as the Menalamba rebellion—broke out in December 1895, and was not suppressed until the end of 1897.[79][80] France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on Réunion Island and to Algeria. \\n The conquest was followed by ten years of civil war, due to the Menalamba insurrection. The \"pacification\" carried out by the French administration lasted more than fifteen years, in response to the rural guerrillas scattered throughout the country. In total, the repression of this resistance to colonial conquest caused several tens of thousands of Malagasy victims.[81]\\n Under colonial rule, plantations were established for the production of a variety of export crops.[82] Slavery was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed; many remained in their former masters\\' homes as servants[83] or as sharecroppers; in many parts of the island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today.[84] Wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of Antananarivo[85] and the Rova palace compound was turned into a museum.[86] Additional schools were built, particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the Merina had not reached. Education became mandatory between the ages of 6 and 13 and focused primarily on the French language and practical skills.[87]\\n Huge mining and forestry concessions were granted to large companies. Native chiefs loyal to the French administration were also granted part of the land. Forced labor was introduced in favor of the French companies and peasants were encouraged, through taxation, to work for wages (especially in the colonial concessions) to the detriment of small individual farms. However, the colonial period was accompanied by movements fighting for independence: the Menalamba, the Vy Vato Sakelika, the Democratic Movement for Malagasy Renovation (MDRM). In 1927, major demonstrations were organized in Antananarivo, notably on the initiative of the communist activist François Vittori, who was imprisoned as a result. The 1930s saw the Malagasy anti-colonial movement gain further momentum. Malagasy trade unionism began to appear underground and the Communist Party of the Madagascar region was formed. But in 1939, all the organizations were dissolved by the administration of the colony, which opted for the Vichy regime. The MDRM was accused by the colonial regime of being at the origin of the 1947 insurrection and was pursued by violent repression.[89]\\n The Merina royal tradition of taxes paid in the form of labor was continued under the French and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to Antananarivo.[90] Malagasy troops fought for France in World War I.[8] In the 1930s, Nazi political thinkers developed the Madagascar Plan that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of Europe\\'s Jews.[91] During the Second World War, the island was the site of the Battle of Madagascar between the Vichy French and an Allied expeditionary force.[92]\\n The occupation of France during the Second World War tarnished the prestige of the colonial administration in Madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement, leading to the Malagasy Uprising of 1947.[93] This movement led the French to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully towards independence.[94] The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an autonomous state within the French Community. A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 June 1960.[95]\\n Since regaining independence, Madagascar has transitioned through four republics with corresponding revisions to its constitution. The First Republic (1960–72), under the leadership of French-appointed President Philibert Tsiranana, was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to France. Many high-level technical positions were filled by French expatriates, and French teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country. Popular resentment over Tsiranana\\'s tolerance for this \"neo-colonial\" arrangement inspired a series of farmer and student protests that overturned his administration in 1972.[58]\\n Gabriel Ramanantsoa, a major general in the army, was appointed interim president and prime minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava, appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General Gilles Andriamahazo ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, who ushered in the Marxist–Leninist Second Republic that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.[96]\\n This period saw a political alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar\\'s economy and a sharp decline in living standards,[58] and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation\\'s broken economy.[97]\\n Ratsiraka\\'s dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established under the leadership of Albert Zafy (1993–96), who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the Third Republic (1992–2010).[98] The new Madagascar constitution established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly. The new constitution also emphasized human rights, social and political freedoms, and free trade.[58] Zafy\\'s term, however, was marred by economic decline, allegations of corruption, and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers. He was consequently impeached in 1996, and an interim president, Norbert Ratsirahonana, was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election. Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001.[97]\\n The contested 2001 presidential elections in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, Marc Ravalomanana, eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana\\'s progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7\\xa0percent per year under his administration. In the latter half of his second term, Ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption.[97]\\n Opposition leader and then-mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, led a movement in early 2009 in which Ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as a coup d\\'état.[99] In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the High Transitional Authority, an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections. In 2010, a new constitution was adopted by referendum, establishing a Fourth Republic, which sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution.[98] Hery Rajaonarimampianina was declared the winner of the 2013 presidential election, which the international community deemed fair and transparent.[100]\\n In 2018 the first round of the presidential election was held on 7 November and the second round was held on 10 December. Three former presidents and the most recent president were the main candidates of the elections. Rajoelina won the second round of the elections. Ravalomana lost the second round and he did not accept the results because of allegations of fraud. Rajaonarimampianina received very modest support in the first round. In January 2019 the High Constitutional Court declared Rajoelina as the winner of the elections and the new president.[101][102][103]\\nIn June 2019 parliamentary elections the Rajoelina\\'s won absolute majority of the seats of the National Assembly. It received 84 seats and the supporters of former president Ravalomana got only 16 seats of 151 seats of the National Assembly. 51 seats of deputies were independent or represented small parties. Rajoelina could rule as a strongman.[104]\\n Mid-2021 marked the beginning of the 2021–2022 Madagascar famine which, due to a severe drought, caused hundreds of thousands of people to face food insecurity and over one million people were on the verge of a famine.[105]\\n In November 2023, Rajoelina was re-elected to another term with 58.95% of the vote in the first round of the election amidst an opposition boycott and a controversy about his acquisition of French citizenship and subsequent eligibility. Turnout was 46.36%, the lowest in a presidential election in the country\\'s history.[106]\\n At 592,800 square kilometres (228,900\\xa0sq\\xa0mi),[8] Madagascar is the world\\'s 46th largest country,[107] the second-largest island country[14] and the fourth-largest island.[8] The country lies mostly between latitudes 12°S and 26°S, and longitudes 43°E and 51°E.[108] Neighboring islands include the French territory of Réunion and the country of Mauritius to the east, as well as the state of Comoros and the French territory of Mayotte to the north west. The nearest mainland state is Mozambique, located to the west.\\n The prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana resulted in the separation of East Gondwana (comprising Madagascar, Antarctica, Australia and the Indian subcontinent) and West Gondwana (Africa–South America) during the Jurassic period, around 185\\xa0million years ago. The Indo-Madagascar landmass separated from Antarctica and Australia around 125 million years ago[109] and Madagascar separated from the Indian landmass about 84–92\\xa0million years ago during the Late Cretaceous.[110] This long history of separation from other continents has allowed plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island\\'s remaining tropical lowland forest. To the west of this ridge lies a plateau in the center of the island ranging in altitude from 750 to 1,500\\xa0m (2,460 to 4,920\\xa0ft) above sea level. These central highlands, traditionally the homeland of the Merina people and the location of their historic capital at Antananarivo, are the most densely populated part of the island and are characterized by terraced, rice-growing valleys lying between grassy hills and patches of the subhumid forests that formerly covered the highland region. To the west of the highlands, the increasingly arid terrain gradually slopes down to the Mozambique Channel and mangrove swamps along the coast.[111]\\n Madagascar\\'s highest peaks rise from three prominent highland massifs: Maromokotro 2,876\\xa0m (9,436\\xa0ft) in the Tsaratanana Massif is the island\\'s highest point, followed by Boby Peak 2,658\\xa0m (8,720\\xa0ft) in the Andringitra Massif, and Tsiafajavona 2,643\\xa0m (8,671\\xa0ft) in the Ankaratra Massif. To the east, the Canal des Pangalanes is a chain of human-made and natural lakes connected by canals built by the French just inland from the east coast and running parallel to it for some 600\\xa0km (370\\xa0mi).[112]\\n The western and southern sides, which lie in the rain shadow of the central highlands, are home to dry deciduous forests, spiny forests, and deserts and xeric shrublands. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar\\'s dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting is a major problem caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.[112]\\n The combination of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island\\'s eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area\\'s rainforest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.[111]\\n Tropical cyclones cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life.[58] In 2004, Cyclone Gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar. The storm killed 172 people, left 214,260 homeless[113] and caused more than US$250\\xa0million in damage.[114] In February 2022, Cyclone Batsirai killed 121 people,[16][115] weeks after Cyclone Ana killed 55 and displaced 130,000 people on the island.[116]\\n A 2022 analysis found that the expected costs for Madagascar, to adapt to and avert the environmental consequences of climate change, are going to be high.[117]\\n As a result of the island\\'s long isolation from neighbouring continents, Madagascar is home to various endemic plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth.[118][119] Approximately 90% of all plant and animal species found in Madagascar are endemic.[120] This distinctive ecology has led some ecologists to refer to Madagascar as the \"eighth continent\",[121] and the island has been classified by Conservation International as a biodiversity hotspot.[118] Madagascar is classed as one of 17 megadiverse countries. The country is home to seven terrestrial ecoregions: Madagascar lowland forests, Madagascar subhumid forests, Madagascar dry deciduous forests, Madagascar ericoid thickets, Madagascar spiny forests, Madagascar succulent woodlands, and Madagascar mangroves.[122]\\n More than 80\\xa0percent of Madagascar\\'s 14,883 plant species are found nowhere else in the world, including five plant families.[123] The family Didiereaceae, composed of four genera and 11 species, is limited to the spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar.[111] Four-fifths of the world\\'s Pachypodium species are endemic to the island.[124] Three-fourths[125] of Madagascar\\'s 860[123] orchid species are found here alone, as are six of the world\\'s nine baobab species.[126] The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic.[125] Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs vinblastine[127][128] and vincristine[127][129] are vinca alkaloids,[130][131] used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma,[132] leukemia,[133] and other cancers,[134] were derived from the Madagascar periwinkle.[135][136] The traveler\\'s palm, known locally as ravinala[137] and endemic to the eastern rain forests,[138] is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the Air Madagascar logo.[139]\\n Like its flora, Madagascar\\'s fauna is diverse and exhibits a high rate of endemism. Lemurs have been characterized as \"Madagascar\\'s flagship mammal species\" by Conservation International.[118] In the absence of monkeys and other competitors, these primates have adapted to a wide range of habitats and diversified into numerous species. As of 2012[update], there were officially 103 species and subspecies of lemur,[141] 39 of which were described by zoologists between 2000 and 2008.[142] They are almost all classified as rare, vulnerable, or endangered. At least 17 species of lemur have become extinct since humans arrived on Madagascar, all of which were larger than the surviving lemur species.[143]\\n A number of other mammals, including the catlike fossa, are endemic to Madagascar. Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60\\xa0percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic.[118] The few families and genera of reptiles that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90\\xa0percent of these being endemic[144] (including one endemic family).[118] The island is home to two-thirds of the world\\'s chameleon species,[144] including the smallest known.[145]\\n Endemic fish of Madagascar include two families, 15 genera and over 100 species, primarily inhabiting the island\\'s freshwater lakes and rivers. Although invertebrates remain poorly studied in Madagascar, researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species. All 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic, as are a majority of the island\\'s butterflies, scarab beetles, lacewings, spiders, and dragonflies.[118]\\n Madagascar\\'s varied fauna and flora are endangered by human activity.[146] Since the arrival of humans around 2,350\\xa0years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90\\xa0percent of its original forest.[147] This forest loss is largely fueled by tavy (\"fat\"), a traditional slash-and-burn agricultural practice imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers.[55] Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice not only for its practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom (fomba malagasy).[148] As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1,400 years ago.[149] By the 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests.[55] More recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1,000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop over the past century.[150] Madagascar had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.63/10, ranking it 119th globally out of 172 countries.[151]\\n According to a conservative estimate, about 40\\xa0percent of the island\\'s original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80\\xa0percent.[152] In addition to traditional agricultural practice, wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana\\'s ousting.[153]\\n Invasive species have likewise been introduced by human populations. Following the 2014 discovery in Madagascar of the Asian common toad, a relative of a toad species that has severely harmed wildlife in Australia since the 1930s, researchers warned the toad could \"wreak havoc on the country\\'s unique fauna.\"[154] Habitat destruction and hunting have threatened many of Madagascar\\'s endemic species or driven them to extinction. The island\\'s elephant birds, a family of endemic giant ratites, became extinct in the 17th century or earlier, most probably because of human hunting of adult birds and poaching of their large eggs for food.[155] Numerous giant lemur species vanished with the arrival of human settlers to the island, while others became extinct over the course of the centuries as a growing human population put greater pressures on lemur habitats and, among some populations, increased the rate of lemur hunting for food.[156] A July 2012 assessment found that the exploitation of natural resources since 2009 has had dire consequences for the island\\'s wildlife: 90\\xa0percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, the highest proportion of any mammalian group. Of these, 23 species were classified as critically endangered. A 2023 study published in Nature Communications found that 120 of the 219 mammal species only found on Madagascar are threatened with extinction.[157]\\n In 2003, Ravalomanana announced the Durban Vision, an initiative to more than triple the island\\'s protected natural areas to over 60,000\\xa0km2 (23,000\\xa0sq\\xa0mi) or 10\\xa0percent of Madagascar\\'s land surface. As of 2011[update], areas protected by the state included five Strict Nature Reserves (Réserves Naturelles Intégrales), 21 Wildlife Reserves (Réserves Spéciales) and 21 National Parks (Parcs Nationaux).[158] In 2007 six of the national parks were declared a joint World Heritage Site under the name Rainforests of the Atsinanana. These parks are Marojejy, Masoala, Ranomafana, Zahamena, Andohahela and Andringitra.[159] Local timber merchants are harvesting scarce species of rosewood trees from protected rainforests within Marojejy National Park and exporting the wood to China for the production of luxury furniture and musical instruments.[160]\\n Madagascar is a semi-presidential representative democratic multi-party republic, wherein the popularly elected president is the head of state and selects a prime minister, who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers. According to the constitution, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet,[161] the Senate and the National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.[8]\\n The public directly elects the president and the 151 members of the National Assembly to five-year terms. All 18 members of the Senate serve six-year terms, with 12 senators elected by local officials and 6 appointed by the president.\\n At the local level, the island\\'s 22 provinces are administered by a governor and provincial council. Provinces are further subdivided into regions and communes. The judiciary is modeled on the French system, with a High Constitutional Court, High Court of Justice, Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, criminal tribunals, and tribunals of first instance.[162] The courts, which adhere to civil law, lack the capacity to quickly and transparently try the cases in the judicial system, often forcing defendants to pass lengthy pretrial detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons.[163]\\n Antananarivo is the administrative capital and largest city of Madagascar.[8] It is located in the highlands region, near the geographic center of the island. King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga.[56] As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital\\'s population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants.[164] The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).[8]\\n Since Madagascar gained independence from France in 1960, the island\\'s political transitions have been marked by numerous popular protests, several disputed elections, an impeachment, two military coups and one assassination. The island\\'s recurrent political crises are often prolonged, with detrimental effects on the local economy, international relations and Malagasy living standards. The eight-month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson.[165] A series of protests led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent, with more than 170 people killed.[166] Modern politics in Madagascar are colored by the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century. The consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence.[167]\\n Madagascar has historically been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being a founding member of the Organisation of African Unity, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the African Union. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina.[168] Madagascar is a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military.[8] Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India,[169] while Madagascar has embassies in sixteen other countries.\\n Human rights in Madagascar are protected under the constitution and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.[170] Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations.[153][170] Torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems. Ravalomanana\\'s 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo\\'s lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.[153] Accusations of media censorship have risen due to the alleged restrictions on the coverage of government opposition.[171] Some journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news.[172]\\n The rise of centralized kingdoms among the Sakalava, Merina and other ethnic groups produced the island\\'s first standing armies by the 16th century, initially equipped with spears but later with muskets, cannons and other firearms.[173] By the early 19th century, the Merina sovereigns of the Kingdom of Madagascar had brought much of the island under their control by mobilizing an army of trained and armed soldiers numbering as high as 30,000.[174] French attacks on coastal towns in the later part of the century prompted then-Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to solicit British assistance to provide training to the Merina monarchy\\'s army. Despite the training and leadership provided by British military advisers, the Malagasy army was unable to withstand French weaponry and was forced to surrender following an attack on the royal palace at Antananarivo. Madagascar was declared a colony of France in 1897.[175]\\n The political independence and sovereignty of the Malagasy armed forces, which comprises an army, navy and air force, was restored with independence from France in 1960.[176] Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders, but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. Under the socialist Second Republic, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of sex, a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991.[177][178] The armed forces are under the direction of the Minister of Defense and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis, as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections, when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate. This tradition was broken in 2009, when a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power.[153]\\n The Minister of Interior is responsible for the national police force, paramilitary force (gendarmerie) and the secret police.[162] The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps.[179] Traditional community tribunals, called dina, are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island.[153] Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing.[162] Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.[153]\\n Madagascar is subdivided into 22 regions (faritra).[8] The regions are further subdivided into 119 districts, 1,579 communes, and 17,485 fokontany.[179]\\n Madagascar became a member state of the United Nations on 20 September 1960, shortly after gaining its independence on 26 June 1960.[182] As of January 2017, 34 police officers from Madagascar are deployed in Haiti as part of the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti.[183] Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development and reconstruction efforts, and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar.[184] These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country. Small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both the quantity and quality of their production, as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.[184] In 2017, Madagascar signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[185]\\n Madagascar\\'s GDP in 2015 was estimated at US$9.98\\xa0billion, with a per capita GDP of $411.82.[186][187] Approximately 69\\xa0percent of the population lives below the national poverty line threshold of one dollar per day.[188] According to the United Nations Development Programme, as of 2021, 68.4 percent of the population is multidimensionally poor.[22] During 2011–15, the average growth rate was 2.6% but was expected to have reached 4.1% in 2016, due to public works programs and a growth of the service sector.[189] The agriculture sector constituted 29\\xa0percent of Malagasy GDP in 2011, while manufacturing formed 15\\xa0percent of GDP. Madagascar\\'s other sources of growth are tourism, agriculture and the extractive industries.[190] The fishing sector represents 800 millions USD or 6% of GNP with 200 000 direct jobs.[191]\\n Tourism focuses on the niche eco-tourism market, capitalizing on Madagascar\\'s unique biodiversity, unspoiled natural habitats, national parks and lemur species.[192] An estimated 365,000 tourists visited Madagascar in 2008, but the sector declined during the political crisis with 180,000 tourists visiting in 2010.[190] However, the sector has been growing steadily for a few years. In 2016, 293,000 tourists landed in the African island with an increase of 20% compared to 2015. For 2017 the country has the goal of reaching 366,000 visitors, while for 2018 government estimates are expected to reach 500,000 annual tourists.[193]\\n The island is still a very poor country in 2018; structural brakes remain in the development of the economy: corruption and the shackles of the public administration, lack of legal certainty, and backwardness of land legislation. The economy, however, has been growing since 2011, with GDP growth exceeding 4% per year;[194][195] almost all economic indicators are growing, the GDP per capita was around $1600 (PPP) for 2017,[196] one of the lowest in the world, although growing since 2012; unemployment was also cut, which in 2016 was equal to 2.1%[197] with a work force of 13.4\\xa0million as of 2017.[198] The main economic resources of Madagascar are tourism, textiles, agriculture, and mining.\\n Poverty affects 92% of the population in 2017. The country ranks fourth in the world in terms of chronic malnutrition. Nearly one in two children under the age of five is stunted. In addition, Madagascar is among the five countries where access to water is the most difficult for the population. Twelve million people do not have access to clean water, according to the NGO WaterAid.[199]\\n Madagascar\\'s natural resources include a variety of agricultural and mineral products. Agriculture (including the growing of raffia), mining, fishing and forestry are mainstays of the economy. In 2017 the top exports were vanilla (US$894M), nickel metal (US$414M), cloves (US$288M), knitted sweaters (US$184M) and cobalt (US$143M).[201]\\n Madagascar is the world\\'s principal supplier of vanilla, cloves[202] and ylang-ylang.[113] The island supplies 80% of the world\\'s natural vanilla.[203] Other key agricultural resources include coffee, lychees and shrimp. Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones, and it currently provides half of the world\\'s supply of sapphires, which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s.[204]\\n Madagascar has one of the world\\'s largest reserves of ilmenite (titanium ore), as well as important reserves of chromite, coal, iron, cobalt, copper and nickel.[112] Several major projects are underway in the mining, oil and gas sectors that are anticipated to give a significant boost to the Malagasy economy. These include such projects as ilmenite and zircon mining at the Mandena mine by Rio Tinto,[205] extraction of nickel by the Ambatovy mine near Moramanga and its processing near Toamasina by Sherritt International,[206] and the development of the giant onshore heavy oil deposits at Tsimiroro and Bemolanga by Madagascar Oil.[207]\\n Exports formed 28\\xa0percent of GDP in 2009.[8] Most of the country\\'s export revenue is derived from the textiles industry, fish and shellfish, vanilla, cloves and other foodstuffs.[190] France is the nation\\'s main trading partner, although the United States, Japan and Germany also have strong economic ties.[112] The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets.[208] Imports of such items as foodstuffs, fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52\\xa0percent of GDP. The main sources of Madagascar\\'s imports include China,[209] France, Iran, Mauritius and Hong Kong.[8]\\n In 2010, Madagascar had approximately 7,617\\xa0km (4,730\\xa0mi) of paved roads, 854\\xa0km (530\\xa0mi) of railways and 432\\xa0km (270\\xa0mi) of navigable waterways.[13] The majority of roads in Madagascar are unpaved, with many becoming impassable in the rainy season. Largely paved national routes connect the six largest regional towns to Antananarivo, with minor paved and unpaved routes providing access to other population centers in each district.[58] Construction of the Antananarivo–Toamasina toll highway, the country\\'s first toll highway, began in December 2022. The approximately US$1,000,000,000 infrastructure project, which will connect Madagascar\\'s capital to its largest seaport, is expected to take four years to complete.[210] Another project meant to create 348 kilometers of roads and create better connections costs €235.5 million. This includes a €116 million grant from the European Union, a €110 million loan from the European Investment Bank, and €4.8 million in finance from the Republic of Madagascar.[211] Since 2016, €100.4 million has been paid to the Republic of Madagascar through this project.[211][212]\\n There are several rail lines in Madagascar. Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used because of their remoteness.[58] Madagascar\\'s government hopes to expand the ports of Antsiranana in the north and Taolagnaro in the south, connecting them to improved road networks, since many imports are every day necessities and Madagascar also relies on export money.[211][213][214] The island\\'s newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company\\'s mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038.[205] Air Madagascar services the island\\'s many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.[58]\\n Running water and electricity are supplied at the national level by a government service provider, Jirama, which is unable to service the entire population. As of 2009[update], only 6.8\\xa0percent of Madagascar\\'s fokontany had access to water provided by Jirama, while 9.5\\xa0percent had access to its electricity services.[179] Fifty-six percent of Madagascar\\'s power is provided by hydroelectric power plants, with the remaining 44% provided by diesel engine generators.[215] Mobile telephone and internet access are widespread in urban areas but remain limited in rural parts of the island. Approximately 30% of the districts are able to access the nations\\' several private telecommunications networks via mobile telephones or land lines.[179] The World Bank estimates that 17 million people in Madagascar\\'s rural areas live more than two kilometres away from an all-season road.[216] In Madagascar, 11% of the rural population has access to power.[211][217]\\n Radio broadcasts remain the principal means by which the Malagasy population access international, national, and local news. Only state radio broadcasts are transmitted across the entire island. Hundreds of public and private stations with local or regional range provide alternatives to state broadcasting.[163] In addition to the state television channel, a variety of privately owned television stations broadcast local and international programming throughout Madagascar. Several media outlets are owned by political partisans or politicians themselves, including the media groups MBS (owned by Ravalomanana) and Viva (owned by Rajoelina),[153] contributing to political polarization in reporting.\\n The media have historically come under varying degrees of pressure to censor their criticism of the government. Reporters are occasionally threatened or harassed, and media outlets are periodically forced to close.[163] Accusations of media censorship have increased since 2009 because of the alleged intensification of restrictions on political criticism.[170] Access to the internet has grown dramatically over the past decade, with an estimated 352,000 residents of Madagascar accessing the internet from home or in one of the nation\\'s many internet cafés in December 2011.[163]\\n Agriculture has long influenced settlement on the island. Almost 60% of the nation\\'s population live in rural areas.[218]\\n In 2024, the population of Madagascar was estimated at 32 million, up from 2.2 million in 1900.[219][58] The annual population growth rate in Madagascar was approximately 2.4% in 2024.[219]\\n Approximately 39.3 percent of the population is younger than 15 years of age, while 57.3 percent are between the ages of 15 and 64. Those aged 65 and older form 3.4 percent of the total population.[219] Only two general censuses, in 1975 and 1993, have been carried out after independence. The most densely populated regions of the island are the eastern highlands and the eastern coast, contrasting most dramatically with the sparsely populated western plains.[58]\\n The Malagasy ethnic group forms over 90\\xa0percent of Madagascar\\'s population and is typically divided into 18 ethnic subgroups.[8] Recent DNA research revealed that the genetic makeup of the average Malagasy person constitutes an approximately equal blend of Southeast Asian, Oceanian and East African genes,[220][221][43] although the genetics of some communities show a predominance of Southeast Asian or East African origins or some Arab, Indian, or European ancestry.[222]\\n Southeast Asian features – specifically from the southern part of Borneo – are most predominant among the Merina of the central highlands,[167] who form the largest Malagasy ethnic subgroup at approximately 26\\xa0percent of the population, while certain communities among the western coastal peoples (collectively called côtiers) have relatively stronger East African features. The largest coastal ethnic subgroups are the Betsimisaraka (14.9\\xa0percent) and the Tsimihety and Sakalava (6\\xa0percent each).[58] Peoples along the east and southeastern coasts often have a roughly equal blend of Austronesian and Bantu ancestry; coastal peoples also usually show the largest genetic influence from the centuries of Arab, Somali, Gujarati, and Tamil traders and merchants of the area, compared to the inland highlander peoples.\\n Chinese, Indian and Comoran minorities are present in Madagascar, as well as a small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga.[58] By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples.[112] The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958[94] to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000\\xa0Comorans, 18,000\\xa0Indians, and 9,000\\xa0Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.[58]\\n The Malagasy language is of Malayo-Polynesian origin and is generally spoken throughout the island. The numerous dialects of Malagasy, which are generally mutually intelligible,[224] can be clustered under one of two subgroups: eastern Malagasy, spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the Merina dialect of Antananarivo, and western Malagasy, spoken across the western coastal plains. The Malagasy language derives from the Southeast Barito languages, with the Ma\\'anyan language being its closest relative, incorporating numerous Malay and Javanese loanwords.[225][226]\\n French became the official language during the colonial period, when Madagascar came under the authority of France. In the first national Constitution of 1958, Malagasy and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic. Madagascar is a francophone country, and French is mostly spoken as a second language among the educated population and used for international communication.[58]\\n Among the upper class in large cities, French is spoken as a native language.[227]\\n No official languages were mentioned in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, on the grounds that the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.[228]\\n The Constitution of 2007 recognised three official languages, Malagasy, French, and English.[229] A fourth Constitution, adopted in 2010 following a referendum,[1] recognised only Malagasy and French.\\n Christianity is the most widely professed religion in Madagascar. According to the most recent national census completed in 1993, a majority of the population (52 percent) adhered to indigenous beliefs, with Christianity being the largest single religion at 41 percent, followed by Islam at 7 percent. However, according to the Pew Research Center in 2020, 85% of the population identified as Christian, while just 4.5% exclusively practiced folk religions; Protestants comprise a plurality of Christians, followed by Roman Catholics.[230] In contrast, a 2020 study conducted by the Association of Religion Data Archives found 58.1% of the population was Christian, 2.1% Muslim, 39.2% practiced traditional faiths, and 0.6% was nonreligious or adhered to other faiths.[231][8]\\n The inconsistency in religious data reflects the common practice of alternating between religious identities or syncretizing different faith traditions. Christians integrate and combine their religious beliefs with the deeply rooted practice of honoring ancestors. For instance, they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a Christian minister to consecrate a famadihana reburial.[232] Christianity is predominant in the highlands.[233] The Malagasy Council of Churches comprises the four oldest and most prominent Christian denominations of Madagascar (Roman Catholic, Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar, Lutheran, and Anglican) and has been influential in Malagasy politics.[234]\\n The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the famadihana, whereby a deceased family member\\'s remains are exhumed and re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds, before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor\\'s memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served, and a hiragasy troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present.[232] Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to fady, taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called Zanahary or Andriamanitra.[235]\\n Islam was first brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages by Arab and Somali Muslim traders, who established several Islamic schools along the eastern coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words, and the adoption of Islamic astrology, would spread across the island, Islam took hold in only a handful of southeastern coastal communities. In 2020, Muslims constituted 2% of the population of Madagascar.[231][8] They are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of Mahajanga and Antsiranana. Muslims are divided between ethnic Malagasy and Indians, Pakistanis and Comorans.\\n Hinduism was introduced to Madagascar through Gujarati people immigrating from the Saurashtra region of India in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak Gujarati or Hindi at home, reflecting the faiths concentration among those of Indian ancestry.[236]\\n Rabbinic Judaism emerged on the island in the 21st century, as the common belief in a myth of Jewish origin for the Malagasy peoples inspired Messianic Jews in Antananarivo to begin researching Judaism and studying the Torah. In 2016, 121 members of the Malagasy Jewish community were formally converted to Orthodox Judaism.[237]\\n Medical centers, dispensaries, and hospitals are found throughout the island, although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in Antananarivo. Access to medical care remains beyond the reach of many Malagasy, especially in the rural areas, and many recourse to traditional healers.[238] In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010, Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000 people and a total of 3,150 doctors, 5,661 nurses, 385 community health workers, 175 pharmacists, and 57 dentists for a population of 22\\xa0million. Fifteen percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector. Approximately 70 percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30 percent originated with international donors and other private sources.[239] The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.[179]\\n Despite these barriers to access, health services have shown a trend toward improvement over the past twenty years. Child immunizations against such diseases as hepatitis B, diphtheria, and measles increased an average of 60 percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6 children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8 percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth.[239] In 2010, the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births,[8] with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births.[240] Schistosomiasis, malaria, and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of AIDS remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at 0.2 percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000 people, in part because of the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa.[239] Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67 years for women.[239]\\n Madagascar had outbreaks of the bubonic plague and pneumonic plague in 2017 (2575 cases, 221 deaths) and 2014 (263 confirmed cases, 71 deaths).[241] In 2019, Madagascar had a measles outbreak, resulting in 118,000 cases and 1,688 deaths. In 2020, Madagascar was also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Undernourishment and hunger rates were at 42% in 2018.[242] According to the United Nations, more than one million people in southern Madagascar are struggling to get enough to eat,[243] due to what could become the first famine caused by climate change.[244]\\n Prior to the 19th century, all education in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills as well as social and cultural values, including respect for ancestors and elders.[58] The first formal European-style school was established in 1818 at Toamasina by members of the London Missionary Society (LMS). The LMS was invited by King Radama I to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children. The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835,[245] but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death.\\n By the end of the 19th century, Madagascar had the most developed and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.[58] Consequently, under the socialist Second Republic, French instructors and other nationals were expelled, Malagasy was declared the language of instruction, and a large cadre of young Malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.[246]\\n This policy, known as malgachization, coincided with a severe economic downturn and a dramatic decline in the quality of education. Those schooled during this period generally failed to master the French language or many other subjects and struggled to find employment, forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty. Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.[247]\\n Education was prioritized under the Ravalomanana administration (2002–09), and is currently free and compulsory from ages 6 to 13.[248] The primary schooling cycle is five years, followed by four years at the lower secondary level and three years at the upper secondary level.[58] During Ravalomanana\\'s first term, thousands of new primary schools and additional classrooms were constructed, older buildings were renovated, and tens of thousands of new primary teachers were recruited and trained. Primary school fees were eliminated, and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students.[248]\\n Government school construction initiatives have ensured at least one primary school per fokontany and one lower secondary school within each commune. At least one upper secondary school is located in each of the larger urban centers.[179] The three branches of the national public university are located at Antananarivo, Mahajanga, and Fianarantsoa. These are complemented by public teacher-training colleges and several private universities and technical colleges.[58]\\n As a result of increased educational access, enrollment rates more than doubled between 1996 and 2006. However, education quality is weak, producing high rates of grade repetition and dropout.[248] Education policy in Ravalomanana\\'s second term focused on quality issues, including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle school leaving certificate (BEPC) to a high school leaving certificate (BAC), and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student-centered teaching methods to boost student learning and participation in the classroom.[249] Public expenditure on education was 2.8\\xa0percent of GDP in 2014. The literacy rate is estimated at 64.7%.[107]\\n Madagascar was ranked 110th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[250]\\n Each of the many ethnic subgroups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, practices and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize fihavanana (solidarity), vintana (destiny), tody (karma), and hasina, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.[58][235]\\n Although social castes are no longer legally recognized, ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status, economic opportunity, and roles within the community.[251] Malagasy people traditionally consult Mpanandro (\"Makers of the Days\") to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or famadihana, according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs. Similarly, the nobles of many Malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the ombiasy (from olona-be-hasina, \"man of much virtue\") of the southeastern Antemoro ethnic group, who trace their ancestry back to early Somali settlers.[252]\\n The diverse origins of Malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the valiha, is a bamboo tube zither carried to Madagascar by early settlers from southern Borneo, and is very similar in form to those found in Indonesia and the Philippines today.[253] Traditional houses in Madagascar are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar.[254] Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living.[255] The production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island\\'s earliest settlers, and Madagascar\\'s national dress, the woven lamba, has evolved into a varied and refined art.[256]\\n The Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in Malagasy cuisine, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes.[257] African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner\\'s wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. Cattle rustling, originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.[51]\\n A wide variety of oral and written literature has developed in Madagascar. One of the island\\'s foremost artistic traditions is its oratory, as expressed in the forms of hainteny (poetry), kabary (public discourse) and ohabolana (proverbs).[258][259] An epic poem exemplifying these traditions, the Ibonia, has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island, and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities.[260] This tradition was continued in the 20th century by such artists as Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, who is considered Africa\\'s first modern poet,[261] and Elie Rajaonarison, an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.[262] Madagascar has also developed a rich musical heritage, embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal salegy or highland hiragasy that enliven village gatherings, local dance floors and national airwaves.[263] Madagascar also has a growing culture of classical music fostered through youth academies, organizations and orchestras that promote youth involvement in classical music.\\n The plastic arts are also widespread throughout the island. In addition to the tradition of silk weaving and lamba production, the weaving of raffia and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats.[208] Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, aloalo funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market.[264] The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the Zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO\\'s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008.[265]\\n Among the Antaimoro people, the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists.[264] Embroidery and drawn thread work are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets.[208] Malagasy artists such as Madame Zo have incorporated textile traditions of Madagascar directly into their work.[266] A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in Madagascar.[267]\\n A number of traditional pastimes have emerged in Madagascar. Moraingy, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate.[268] The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced in many regions.[269] In addition to sports, a wide variety of games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially the result of the obsession that Andrianjaka\\'s older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities.[270]\\n Western recreational activities were introduced to Madagascar over the past two centuries. Rugby union is considered the national sport of Madagascar.[271] Soccer is also popular. Madagascar has produced a world champion in pétanque, a French game similar to lawn bowling, which is widely played in urban areas and throughout the Highlands.[272] School athletics programs typically include soccer, track and field, judo, boxing, women\\'s basketball and women\\'s tennis. Madagascar sent its first competitors to the Olympic Games in 1964, and has also competed in the African Games.[112] Scouting is represented in Madagascar by its own local federation of three scouting clubs. Membership in 2011 was estimated at 14,905.[273]\\n Because of its advanced sports facilities, Antananarivo gained the hosting rights for several of Africa\\'s top international basketball events, including the 2011 FIBA Africa Championship,[274] the 2009 FIBA Africa Championship for Women,[275] the 2014 FIBA Africa Under-18 Championship,[276] the 2013 FIBA Africa Under-16 Championship,[277] and the 2015 FIBA Africa Under-16 Championship for Women.[278] Madagascar\\'s national 3x3 basketball team won the gold medal at the 2019 African Games.\\n Malagasy cuisine reflects the diverse influences of Southeast Asian, African, Oceania, Indian, Chinese, and European culinary traditions. The complexity of Malagasy meals can range from the simple, traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers, to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island\\'s 19th-century monarchs. Throughout almost the entire island, the contemporary cuisine of Madagascar typically consists of a base of rice (vary) served with an accompaniment (laoka). The many varieties of laoka may be vegetarian or include animal proteins, and typically feature a sauce flavored with such ingredients as ginger, onion, garlic, tomato, vanilla, coconut milk, salt, curry powder, green peppercorns or, less commonly, other spices or herbs. In parts of the arid south and west, pastoral families may replace rice with maize, cassava, or curds made from fermented zebu milk. A wide variety of sweet and savory fritters as well as other street foods are available across the island, as are diverse tropical and temperate-climate fruits. Locally produced beverages include fruit juices, coffee, herbal teas and teas, and alcoholic drinks such as rum, wine, and beer.[257] Three Horses Beer is the most popular beer on the island[279] and is considered emblematic of Madagascar.[280]\\n 20°S 47°E\\ufeff / \\ufeff20°S 47°E\\ufeff / -20; 47', 'Kung Fu Panda is an American martial arts comedy media franchise that started in 2008 with the release of the animated film Kung Fu Panda produced by DreamWorks Animation. Following the adventures of the titular Po Ping (primarily voiced by Jack Black and Mick Wingert), a giant panda who is improbably chosen as the prophesied Dragon Warrior and becomes a master of kung fu, the franchise is set in a fantasy wuxia genre version of ancient China populated by anthropomorphic animals. Although everyone initially doubts him, including Po himself, he proves himself worthy as he strives to fulfill his destiny.\\n The franchise consists mainly of four animated films: Kung Fu Panda (2008), Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011), Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016) and Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024), as well as three television series: Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness (2011–2016), The Paws of Destiny (2018–2019), and The Dragon Knight (2022–2023).

All four films were critical and commercial successes,[1] grossing over $2 billion overall, making it the seventh highest-grossing animated film franchise, while the second film was the highest-grossing film worldwide directed solely by a woman (Jennifer Yuh Nelson) until Wonder Woman (2017). The series is additionally popular in China as an outstanding Western interpretation of the wuxia film genre.[2]\\n \\n \\n Po, a clumsy panda bear, is a kung fu fanatic who lives in the Valley of Peace and works in his goose father Mr. Ping\\'s noodle shop, unable to realize his dream of learning the art of kung fu. One day, a kung fu tournament is held for the elderly spiritual leader of the valley, Grand Master Oogway, to determine the identity of the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master capable of understanding the secret of the Dragon Scroll, which is said to contain the key to limitless power. Everyone in the valley expects the Dragon Warrior to be one of the Furious Five—Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Viper, and Crane—a quintet of kung fu warriors trained by Master Shifu to protect the valley. To everyone\\'s surprise, Oogway chooses Po, who has accidentally stumbled into the tournament arena after arriving late via fireworks explosion.\\n Refusing to believe that Po can be the Dragon Warrior, Shifu subjects Po to torturous training exercises in order to discourage him into quitting. Determined to change himself into someone he can respect, Po perseveres in his training and befriends the Furious Five, who had previously mocked Po for his lack of skill in kung fu. Po soon learns that the valley is being approached by Tai Lung, an evil kung fu warrior who has escaped from prison to take revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll, and despairs he will be unable to defeat him. However, Shifu discovers that Po is capable of martial arts when motivated by food, and successfully trains him to learn kung fu. After his training is complete, Po is given the Dragon Scroll, which he discovers to be blank. However, Po realizes that the key to limitless power lies within himself, allowing him to defeat Tai Lung and restore peace to the valley.\\n Po now lives his dream as a kung fu master and protects the Valley of Peace alongside the Furious Five. However, he is thrown into internal conflict when he begins having flashbacks of his mother and learns from Mr. Ping that he was adopted as an infant. Shortly after, Po and the Five are sent on a mission to stop the evil peacock Lord Shen from using a newly developed weapon, the cannon, to conquer all of China and destroy kung fu tradition. Po remains tormented by thoughts of being abandoned by his real parents until he is guided by a wise old soothsayer to embrace his past, and remembers that his parents risked their lives to save him from Shen, who had set out to exterminate all pandas after learning of a prophecy that he would be defeated by \"a warrior of black-and-white\". Po achieves inner peace, which allows him to destroy Shen\\'s new weapon, defeat Shen, and accept Mr. Ping as his father. However, during the last scene of the movie, it shows Po\\'s biological father realizing his son is alive.\\n Shortly after the events of the second film, Shifu relinquishes his duties as master of the Jade Palace to Po, claiming that the next step of his own apprenticeship is to oversee the Furious Five\\'s training. While struggling with this new responsibility, Po rejoices upon reuniting with his biological father, Li, though Mr. Ping is less enthusiastic. However, news arrives that the spirit warrior General Kai has returned to the mortal realm and is \\'collecting\\' Kung Fu masters from all over China, both living and dead, to serve in his army of Jade Zombies. Po and the others discover from a scroll left by Oogway that Kai can only be defeated by the power of Chi, a technique known only by the panda colonies; thus, Po and Li set to the secret Panda Valley in order to have Po learn it. Po eventually discovers, to his horror, that Li had deceived him, because the pandas have long forgotten about how to manipulate the Chi, and he just wanted to protect his son from Kai. Once making amends with both his adoptive and biological fathers, Po joins forces with Ping, Tigress, and the pandas to make a stand against Kai, all mastering the power of Chi in the process and using its power to destroy him for good. After returning to the Valley of Peace, Po spends his days spreading the teachings of Kung fu and Chi.\\n Shifu tasks Po to retire as the Dragon Warrior and find a successor as he must advance to become the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace. Disappointed, he struggles to find the right candidate angering Shifu. He later spots a corsac fox and thief named Zhen entering the Jade Palace and sends her to prison but soon learns that Tai Lung has returned. Zhen reveals that it wasn\\'t actually Tai Lung but a shapeshifting sorceress named The Chameleon. Po decides to go after her and Zhen agrees to lead him to the Chameleon in exchange for a reduction of her sentence. They both head towards Juniper City and there, Po finds that Zhen is a wanted criminal, leading to both of them getting arrested. They successfully escape to the Den of Thieves where Zhen reunites with her old mentor Han who allows them to stay there for one day. Po and Zhen then enter Chameleon\\'s lair, where Zhen betrays Po, takes the Staff of Wisdom and gives it to the Chameleon, who is revealed to be her master. Po manages to escape without the staff but Chameleon, who has shapeshifted into Zhen, throws him off of the cliff and Po gets saved by his adoptive and biological father. The Chameleon uses the staff to summon every martial arts master from the Spirit Realm, stealing their kung fu abilities and locking them in cages. Zhen decides to deflect away from Chameleon and reunites with Po. Zhen later manages to convince the Den of Thieves to help her out in saving Po. Zhen and Po defeat the Chameleon and return the stolen Kung fu to their masters. Po sends them back to the spirit realm with Tai Lung taking the Chameleon with him. At the Valley of Peace, Po chooses Zhen as the next Dragon Warrior and the Furious Five joins him in training her.\\n In May 2024, following the critical and commercial success of Kung Fu Panda 4, Mitchell suggested that a fifth film could happen, but it would likely not be until at least 2027 due to the lengthy production process.[3]\\n Kung Fu Panda Holiday (also known as Kung Fu Panda Holiday Special) is a 2010 television special that premiered on NBC on November 24.

The first installment in the Toy Story franchise, it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The film was directed by John Lasseter (in his feature directorial debut), written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow based on a story by Lasseter, Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft, produced by Bonnie Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim, and features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, and Jim Varney.\\n Taking place in a world where toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot of Toy Story focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pullstring cowboy doll named Woody and a modern space cadet action figure, Buzz Lightyear, as Woody develops jealousy towards Buzz when he becomes their owner Andy\\'s favorite toy.\\n Following the success of Tin Toy, a short film that was released in 1988, Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film that was told from a small toy\\'s perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film\\'s tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced Toy Story under minor financial constraints.\\n Toy Story premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 19, 1995, and was released in theaters in North America on November 22 of that year. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,[2] eventually grossing over $373 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 1995. The film received critical acclaim, with praise directed towards the technical innovation of the animation, script, Randy Newman\\'s score, appeal to all age groups, and voice performances (particularly Hanks and Allen), and holds a 100% approval rating on film aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. The film is frequently lauded as one of the best animated films ever made and, due to its status as the first computer-animated film, one of the most important films in the medium\\'s history and film at large.[4] The film received three Academy Award nominations—Best Original Screenplay (the first animated film to be nominated for the award), Best Original Song for \"You\\'ve Got a Friend in Me\", and Best Original Score—in addition to being honored with a non-competitive Special Achievement Academy Award.[5]\\n In 2005, Toy Story was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", one of nine films designated in its first year of eligibility. The success of Toy Story launched a multimedia franchise, spawning three sequels (and a planned fourth sequel) beginning with Toy Story 2 (1999), a spin-off film Lightyear (2022), and numerous short films. The film also had a theatrical 3D re-release in 2009 as part of a double feature with the second film.\\n A group of sentient toys, who pretend to be lifeless when humans are around, are preparing to move into a new house with their young owner Andy Davis, his infant sister Molly, and their single mother Mrs. Davis. Learning that Andy\\'s birthday party has been unexpectedly moved to an earlier date, several toys — including Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex the tyrannosaur, Hamm the piggy bank, and Bo Peep the porcelain doll — become concerned that Andy might receive something that will replace them. To calm them, Sheriff Woody, Andy\\'s favorite toy and their de facto leader, sends Sarge and his green army men to spy on Andy\\'s birthday party with a baby monitor. Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who believes he is an actual Space Ranger and does not know he is really a toy. Buzz impresses the others with his high-tech features and becomes Andy\\'s new favorite toy, provoking Woody\\'s jealousy.\\n Two days before the move, Andy\\'s family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet. To ensure Andy brings him along and not Buzz, Woody tries knocking Buzz behind the desk with RC, the radio-controlled car. However, Buzz is accidentally knocked out of the bedroom window instead, and most of the other toys believe Woody has deliberately killed Buzz. Andy takes Woody with him, but Buzz furiously confronts him in the car. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind; after a further quarrel, they hitch a ride to the restaurant on a Pizza Planet delivery truck.\\n At Pizza Planet, Buzz mistakes a claw crane full of toy aliens for a rocket, and climbs in, pursued by Woody. Sid Phillips, Andy\\'s sadistic next-door neighbor, takes the two from the crane to his house, where they encounter his Bull Terrier Scud and his \"mutant\" toys, made from parts of other toys he has destroyed.\\n Buzz, after watching a television commercial promoting him, suffers an existential crisis, realizing he is a toy after all. He attempts to fly but falls and breaks his arm. After Sid\\'s toys fix Buzz, Sid tapes Buzz to a firework rocket, planning to blow him up the following day. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is to make Andy happy, restoring Buzz\\'s resolve. Sid takes Buzz out to blow him up, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to \"break the rules\" and frighten Sid into never harming toys again.\\n Now freed, Woody and Buzz pursue the Davis\\' moving truck, but Scud attacks Woody. Buzz stays behind to fight off the dog; Woody climbs into the truck, and pushes RC out to rescue Buzz. Still thinking Woody has killed another toy, the others also toss him out of the truck. Woody and Buzz pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys see them and realize their mistake. RC\\'s batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket strapped to Buzz. Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody glide through the sunroof of Mrs. Davis\\' car, landing safely inside.\\n As the toys listen in on the Christmas gift opening in the new house, Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a Mrs. Potato Head. Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be \"worse\" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a dachshund puppy.\\n John Lasseter\\'s first experience with computer animation was during his work as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation, when two of his friends showed him the light-cycle scene from Tron. It was an eye-opening experience that awakened Lasseter to the possibilities offered by the new medium of computer-generated animation.[6] Lasseter tried to pitch The Brave Little Toaster as a fully computer-animated film to Disney, but the idea was rejected and Lasseter was fired.[7] He then went on to work at Lucasfilm and in 1986, he became a founding member of Pixar. In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs.[8] At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the Pixar Image Computer\\'s capabilities. In 1988, Lasseter produced the short film Tin Toy, which was told from the perspective of a toy, referencing Lasseter\\'s love of classic toys. Tin Toy won the 1989 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first computer-generated film to do so.[9]\\n Tin Toy gained Disney\\'s attention, and the new team at The Walt Disney Company, CEO Michael Eisner and chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg in the film division, sought to get Lasseter to come back.[9] Lasseter, grateful for Jobs\\' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder Ed Catmull, \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"[9] Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.[9] Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when Tim Burton, who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to The Nightmare Before Christmas, Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney film outside the studio. This allowed Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.[10]\\n Both sides were willing. Catmull and fellow Pixar co-founder Alvy Ray Smith had long wanted to produce a computer-animated feature, but only by the early 1990s were the computers cheap and powerful enough to make this possible.[11][12] In addition, Disney had licensed Pixar\\'s Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), and that made it the largest customer for Pixar\\'s computers.[13] Jobs made it apparent to Katzenberg that although Disney was happy with Pixar, it was not the other way around: \"We want to do a film with you,\" said Jobs. \"That would make us happy.\"[13]\\n Catmull, Smith, and head of animation Ralph Guggenheim met with Walt Disney Feature Animation president Peter Schneider in the summer of 1990 to discuss making a feature film, but they found the atmosphere to be puzzling and contentious. They later learned that while Katzenberg was pushing the idea of working with Pixar, Schneider did not want to bring in a non-Disney animation studio. Katzenberg arranged to meet directly with the Pixar contingent, this time including Lasseter and Jobs. The Pixar team proposed a Christmas television special, A Tin Toy Christmas, as a first step, but Katzenberg countered that as long as they were gearing up to transition from 30-second commercials to a half-hour special, they might as well go all the way and make a feature-length film.[14]\\n Katzenberg also made it clear that he was only working with Pixar to get access to Lasseter\\'s talents,[13][14] and that the Pixar team would be signing up to work with a self-described \"tyrant\" and micro-manager.[13][14] However, he invited them to talk with Disney\\'s animators and get their opinions on working under him and Lasseter was impressed with what he heard.[15] The two companies began negotiations, although they disagreed on key points including whether Disney would get the rights to Pixar\\'s animation technology[15] or whether Pixar would retain partial ownership of the films, characters, and home video and sequel rights.[13] As Pixar was nearing bankruptcy and desperate for funds,[13] they settled on a deal that would allow Disney to have complete ownership and control of the films and characters, including the rights to make sequels without Pixar\\'s involvement, while Pixar would get approximately 12.5% of ticket sales.[16][17] These early negotiations became a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.[13]\\n An agreement to produce a feature film based on Tin Toy with a working title of Toy Story was finalized, and production began soon thereafter.[18]\\n Originally, Toy Story was going to feature \"Tinny\", the wind-up one-man band toy from the Tin Toy short film, along with \"the dummy\", a ventriloquist\\'s dummy. While the film\\'s premise was still about toys\\' desire to be played with by children, the rest of the film\\'s script, which involved Tinny being left behind at a gas station, meeting up with the dummy, and having a series of adventures before finding their way into a kindergarten classroom where they can be played with every day, was quite different.[19] Katzenberg was unhappy with the treatment drafted by Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter, as the two character\\'s motivations were too similar. Instead, he encouraged them to write it as a buddy film, giving the two main characters contrasting personalities, and having them only become friends after being forced to work together.[20][21] Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter delivered a revised treatment in September 1991 that more closely resembles the final version of the film: Tinny replaces the ventriloquist dummy as a child\\'s favorite toy, their bickering causes them to be left behind at a gas station, they almost catch up to the family at a pizza restaurant, they have to escape a kid that mutilates toys, and the movie ends with a chase scene as the two toys try to catch up to the family\\'s moving van.[20]\\n The script went through many changes before the final version of it. Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure in the likes of G.I. Joe and was then given a space theme. Tinny\\'s name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut Buzz Aldrin).[22] Lightyear\\'s design was modeled on the suits worn by Apollo astronauts as well as the aforementioned G.I. Joe action figures. Also, the green and purple color scheme on Lightyear\\'s suit was inspired by Lasseter and his wife, Nancy, whose favorite colors are green and purple, respectively.[23][24] Woody was inspired by a Casper the Friendly Ghost doll that Lasseter had when he was a child; he was a ventriloquist\\'s dummy with a pull-string (hence the name \"Woody\"). This was until character designer Bud Luckey suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy. Lasseter liked the contrast between the Western and the science fiction genres and the character immediately changed. Eventually, all of the ventriloquist dummy aspects of the character were deleted as the dummy looked \"sneaky and mean\".[25] However they kept the name \"Woody\" to pay homage to the Western actor Woody Strode.[22] The story department drew inspiration from films such as Midnight Run and The Odd Couple,[26] and Lasseter screened Hayao Miyazaki\\'s Castle in the Sky for further influence.\\n Since Toy Story\\'s script writers had little experience with feature films, they attended a seminar given by screenwriter Robert McKee.[25] They were inspired by his guidance, based on Aristotle\\'s Poetics, that the main character in a story should be defined by how they react to the obstacles they face, and that it is those obstacles that make characters interesting.[27] Disney also appointed the duo Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon thought that while the script did not work, it had \"a great structure\". He added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for a Barbie doll; the latter transformed into Bo Peep as Mattel would not license the character.[28] Whedon also re-visioned Buzz Lightyear from being a dim-witted but cheerful and self-aware character to an action figure who isn\\'t aware that he\\'s a toy—an epiphany that transformed the film.[29] A brainstorming session with members of Disney Animation\\'s creative team resulted in the addition of the three-eyed squeaky toy aliens.[30]\\n Katzenberg approved the script on January 19, 1993, at which point voice casting began.[31] Paul Newman, who subsequently accepted the role of Doc Hudson in the 2006 Pixar film Cars, was considered for the role of Woody.[32] Robin Williams and Clint Eastwood were also considered for Woody,[33] but Lasseter always wanted Tom Hanks to play the role. Lasseter claimed that Hanks \"has the ability to take emotions and make them appealing. Even if the character, like the one in A League of Their Own, is down-and-out and despicable.\"[31] To gauge how an actor\\'s voice might fit with a character, Lasseter borrowed a common Disney technique: animate a vocal monologue from a well-established actor to meld the actor\\'s voice with the appearance or actions of the animated character.[28] This early test footage, using Hanks\\' voice from Turner & Hooch, convinced Hanks to sign on to the film.[31][34]\\n Billy Crystal was approached to play Buzz, and was given his own monologue, utilizing dialogue from When Harry Met Sally. However, he turned down the role, believing the film would be unsuccessful due to its animation. Crystal regretted this upon seeing the film; he subsequently accepted the role of Mike Wazowski in the 2001 Pixar film Monsters, Inc.. In addition to Crystal, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase and Jim Carrey, along with a number of other actors, including Jason Alexander, Dan Aykroyd, Matthew Broderick, Kevin Costner, Michael J. Fox, Richard Gere, David Hasselhoff, Michael Keaton, Wayne Knight, Bill Paxton, Dennis Quaid, Kurt Russell, Adam Sandler and John Travolta, were also considered for the role of Buzz.[35][36][37][38][39][40][41] Lasseter took the role to Tim Allen, who was appearing in Disney\\'s Home Improvement, and he accepted.[42] Crystal later stated in an interview that he would not have been right as Buzz, and that Allen was \"fantastic\" in the role.[43][44] Before Wallace Shawn and Jim Varney were cast as Rex and Slinky Dog, Rick Moranis and John Cleese were originally considered for the roles.[33]\\n To cast Andy, Pixar held an open call for young male actors to bring a toy with them. John Morris (who voices Andy in the film) brought multiple toys, specifically 45 X-Men figures, contrary to the instructions of bringing just one, and Pixar reacted to his dumping of the toys with laughter.[45]\\n Toy Story was both Hanks\\' and Allen\\'s first animated film, and they recorded their lines together to make their characters\\' chemistry and interactions realistic.[46]\\n Every couple of weeks, Lasseter and his team showed Disney their latest storyboards or footage. Disney was impressed by Pixar\\'s technical innovation, but less so of the plot. Katzenberg discarded most of Pixar\\'s script ideas, giving his own extensive notes. Katzenberg primarily wanted to add \"more edginess\" to the two main characters,[21] as Disney wanted Toy Story to appeal to both children and adults, and they asked for adult references to be added to the film.[31] The characters ended up being stripped of their charm,[21][42] with Hanks, while recording Woody\\'s dialogue for the story reels, pointed out that the Woody character had been made into a \"real jerk\".[21] Pixar screened the first half of the film for Disney executives on November 19, 1993—an event they later dubbed the \"Black Friday Incident\".[31][47] The results were disastrous, and Disney\\'s head of feature animation, Peter Schneider, halted production.[48] Katzenberg asked colleague Thomas Schumacher why the reels were bad, to which Schumacher answered, \"Because it\\'s not their movie anymore; it\\'s completely not the movie that John set out to make.\"[47]\\n Lasseter was embarrassed by the current state of the film, later recalling, \"It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean characters that I\\'ve ever seen.\" Katzenberg allowed him to take the script back to Pixar for rewrites,[47] and the production crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script, being funded personally by Jobs until Disney resumed production.[47] Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time\" according to story department manager BZ Petroff.[49] Schneider appealed directly to Eisner to cancel the project altogether.[50][20] Stanton and the other story artists worked to quickly produce new script pages, with help from consultants such as Whedon, and the first revisions were completed in two weeks as promised.[49]\\n Pixar\\'s script rewrites took three months, and saw Woody transformed from a tyrant to a wise leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear\\'s character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he genuinely doesn\\'t know he\\'s a toy\".[50] Katzenberg and Schneider resumed production with the new script by February 1994,[47] and the voice actors returned one month later to record their new lines.[31] The crew grew from 24 people to 110, and now included 27 animators and 22 technical directors.[51][52] In comparison, The Lion King, released in 1994, required a staff of 800.[51] In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. However, the $17\\xa0million production budget was no longer going to be sufficient, and Jobs requested more funds from Disney to compensate them for the time lost in rewrites based on Katzenberg\\'s notes. Catmull was able to reach a compromise on a new budget, but the incident led Jobs to rethink their deal with Disney.[47]\\n We couldn\\'t have made this movie in traditional animation. This is a story that can only really be told with three-dimensional toy characters. ... Some of the shots in this film are so beautiful.\\n —Tom Schumacher, Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation[53] Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; the magnet for talent was not mediocre pay but the allure of taking part in the first computer-animated feature.[52] Lasseter said of the challenges of computer animation, \"We had to make things look more organic. Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs.\"[31] The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was first either created out of clay or modeled from a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer-animated design.[54]\\n Once the animators had a model, its articulation and motion controls were coded; this allowed each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping.[54] Out of all of the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth.[31][55] The first piece of animation, a 30-second test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with several things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody\\'s yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz\\'s helmet and the decals on his spacesuit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy\\'s room.[25]\\n There were eight teams that were responsible for different aspects of all of the shots. The art department was responsible for determining the overall color and lighting scheme.[56] The layout department was responsible for determining the position of all elements of the shot, as well as programming the virtual camera\\'s position and movements.[56] The animation department created the movements of the characters, generally with one animator being assigned to animate an entire shot, but occasionally with each character having its own animator.[56] The shading team used Pixar\\'s RenderMan software to assign surface textures and reflectivity properties to objects.[57] The lighting team placed global, spot, and flood lighting within the scenes.[57] The \"Render Farm\" used Sun Microsystems computers, running around the clock, to produce the final frames of the film.[30] The camera team recorded the finished frames, which had been rendered at a resolution of 1536 by 922, onto film stock.[30] Finally, Skywalker Sound mixed sound effects, the musical score, and the dialogue to create the audio for the film.[55]\\n In order to make the film feel as realistic as possible, the layout department, led by Craig Good, avoided the sweeping camera shots popular in computer animation at the time, and instead focused on emulating what would have been possible had the film been shot in live-action with real film cameras.[56] The animation department, led by Rich Quade and Ash Brannon, used Pixar\\'s Menv software to hand pose the characters at key frames based on videotape of the actors recording their lines, and let the software do the inbetweening.[58] To sync the characters\\' mouths and facial expressions to the actors\\' recorded voices, animators spent a week per eight seconds of animation, as Lasseter felt that automatic lip syncing would not properly convey a character\\'s emotions.[54][58] The shading team, led by Tom Porter, used scans of real objects, as well as textures drawn by artists and created with procedural generation algorithms, to \"dress\" the objects in the film.[57]\\n The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total, divided between 1,561 shots that totaled over 77 minutes.[31][54][59][56] Pixar was able to render less than 30 seconds of the film per day.[60]\\n Lasseter did not want to make Toy Story into a musical, as he felt that it would make the film feel less genuine. Whedon later agreed, saying \"It would have been a really bad musical because it\\'s a buddy movie. It\\'s about people who won\\'t admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, \\'I hate you.\\' It\\'s not about open emotion.\"[31] However, Disney preferred to make it a musical, as they had had much success with incorporating Broadway-style musical numbers into their animated films, and encouraged Pixar to do the same.[31] As a compromise, although the characters would not sing, the movie would feature non-diegetic songs as background music.[28] Despite this not happening, the first musical number is seen at the end of Toy Story 2 (1999), and Toy Story: The Musical (2012) is the first version of the original to actually feature the cast of characters singing.\\n Randy Newman was hired, and composed three original songs for the film. The film\\'s signature song \"You\\'ve Got a Friend in Me\", was written in one day. The song \"Hakuna Matata\" from The Lion King is heard briefly during the climax when Woody and Buzz are trying to get into the truck while riding RC.[31]\\nOn Newman, Lasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"[31] The soundtrack for Toy Story was produced by Walt Disney Records and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film\\'s release.[61]\\n The film\\'s editors, including Lee Unkrich, worked on Toy Story up until the September 1995 deadline to deliver a final cut for scoring and sound design.[61] According to Unkrich, a scene removed from the original final edit featured Sid torturing Buzz and Woody violently at his house before the scene where Sid interrogates Woody with a magnifying glass. The torture scene was removed because the crew felt that the audience would be so invested in Buzz and Woody\\'s characters by that point that they would be uncomfortable watching them being subjected to such violence.[62] Another scene, in which Woody tries to get Buzz\\'s attention when he was stuck in the box crate while insincerely apologizing for accidentally getting him knocking out of the window, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the film.[62] A test screening in July 1995 received encouraging responses from the audience, but the film was not rated as highly as had been hoped, leading to another last-minute round of edits.[61] Eisner, who attended the screening, suggested that the final shot of the film should be of both Woody and Buzz, leading to the film\\'s final shot of the two worried about the arrival of Andy\\'s new puppy.[61]\\n The crew had difficulty analysing the film\\'s quality due to footage being in scattered pieces.[60] Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.[60] Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.[63]\\n Sources indicate that Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and had been exploring the possibility of selling Pixar to companies such as Hallmark Cards and Microsoft.[47][63] However, as the film progressed, Jobs, like Schneider, became increasingly passionate about the film and the transformative nature of what Pixar might be able to accomplish. Eager for Pixar to have the funds necessary to negotiate with Disney as an equal partner, and optimistic about the impact the finished film would have, Jobs decided that he would schedule an initial public offering (IPO) of Pixar just a week after the film\\'s November release.[47]\\n Both Disney and Pixar held separate premieres for Toy Story, with Disney holding theirs at their flagship El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 19, 1995, and Pixar holding theirs the following night at the Regency Center in San Francisco. According to David Price\\'s 2008 book The Pixar Touch, the film deeply resonated with audiences, with even the adults being noticeably moved by the film.[64]\\n In some international territories, the theatrical release of the film was preceded by a re-release of the Roger Rabbit short Roller Coaster Rabbit.\\n In addition to showing at the El Capitan, where tickets included admission to the Totally Toy Story funhouse that Disney had built in the Hollywood Masonic Temple next door,[65] the film opened on 2,281 screens on the 22nd and later expanded to 2,574.[64]\\n The film was also shown at the Berlin International Film Festival out of competition from February 15 to 26, 1996.[66][67] Elsewhere, the film opened in March 1996.[63]\\n Marketing for Toy Story included $20\\xa0million spent by Disney for advertising as well as advertisers such as Burger King, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Payless ShoeSource paying $125\\xa0million in promotions for the film.[68] Marketing consultant Al Ries reflected on the promotion: \"This will be a killer deal. How can a kid, sitting through a one-and-a-half-hour movie with an army of recognizable toy characters, not want to own one?\"[69] Despite this, Disney Consumer Products was slow to see the potential of Toy Story.[63] When the Thanksgiving release date was announced in January 1995, many toy companies were accustomed to having eighteen months to two years of lead time and passed on the project. Disney shopped the film at the Toy Fair trade show in February 1995, where only the small Canadian company Thinkway Toys, was interested in licensing the toy rights for the Toy Story characters.[70] Disney promoted the film by inserting its trailer into the home-video re-release of Cinderella, showing a behind-the-scenes documentary on the Disney Channel, and incorporating the characters into a parade at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Florida.[61]\\n It was screenwriter Joss Whedon\\'s idea to incorporate Barbie as a character who could rescue Woody and Buzz in Toy Story\\'s final act.[71] The idea was dropped after Mattel objected and refused to license the toy. Producer Ralph Guggenheim claimed that Mattel did not allow the use of the toy as \"They [Mattel] philosophically felt girls who play with Barbie dolls are projecting their personalities onto the doll. If you give the doll a voice and animate it, you\\'re creating a persona for it that might not be every little girl\\'s dream and desire.\"[31] Hasbro likewise refused to license G.I. Joe (mainly because Sid was going to blow one up, prompting the filmmakers to instead use a fictional toy, Combat Carl), but they did license Mr. Potato Head.[31] The only real-life toy in the film that was not in production was Slinky Dog, which had been discontinued since the 1970s. When designs for Slinky were sent to Betty James (Slinky inventor Richard James\\'s wife) she said that Pixar had improved the toy and that it was \"cuter\" than the original.[72]\\n On October 2, 2009, Toy Story was re-released in Disney Digital 3-D.[73] The film was also released with Toy Story 2 as a double feature for a two-week run[74] which was extended due to its success.[75] In addition, the film\\'s second sequel, Toy Story 3, was also released in the 3-D format.[73] Lasseter commented on the new 3-D re-release:\\n The Toy Story films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we\\'re so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy in a whole new way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody, and the gang from Andy\\'s room, we thought it would be great to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way.[76]\\n Translating the film into 3-D involved revisiting the original computer data and virtually placing a second camera into each scene, creating left eye and right eye views needed to achieve the perception of depth.[77] Unique to computer animation, Lasseter referred to this process as \"digital archaeology\".[77] The process took four months, as well as an additional six months for the two films to add the 3-D. The lead stereographer Bob Whitehill oversaw this process and sought to achieve an effect that affected the emotional storytelling of the film:\\n When I would look at the films as a whole, I would search for story reasons to use 3-D in different ways. In Toy Story, for instance, when the toys were alone in their world, I wanted it to feel consistent with a safer world. And when they went out to the human world, that\\'s when I really blew out the 3-D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming.[77]\\n Unlike other countries, the United Kingdom received the films in 3-D as separate releases. Toy Story was released on October 2, 2009. Toy Story 2 was instead released January 22, 2010.[78] The re-release performed well at the box office, opening with $12,500,000 in its opening weekend, placing at the third position after Zombieland and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.[79][80] The double feature grossed $30.7\\xa0million in its five-week release.[80]\\n As part of Disney\\'s 100th anniversary, Toy Story was re-released in selected CINEMARK theaters from July 21 to August 3, 2023,[81] as well as UK cinemas from September 29 to October 5,[82] and Latin American theaters from October 12 to 18 alongside Cinderella.[83]\\n Toy Story was released by Walt Disney Home Video on VHS and LaserDisc in the United States and Canada on October 29, 1996,[84] with no bonus material. Within the first few weeks of this release, VHS rentals and sales totaled $5.1\\xa0million, ranking Toy Story as the No. 1 video, beating out Twister.[85][86] Over 21.5\\xa0million VHS copies were sold during the first year.[87] A deluxe edition widescreen LaserDisc 4-disc box set was released on December 18, 1996.[88] This THX-certified LaserDisc release features bonus material, including the history and development of characters, storyboards and story reels, abandoned concepts and characters, audio commentary, outtakes, deleted animation and trailers.[88] On January 11, 2000, the film was re-released on VHS, but this time as the first video to be part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection with the bonus short film Tin Toy. This release sold two million copies.[87]\\n Toy Story was released for the first time on DVD on October 17, 2000, in a two-pack with its first sequel Toy Story 2.[89] The same day, a 3-disc \"Ultimate Toy Box\" set was released, featuring Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and the third disc of bonus materials.[87] Both DVD versions have the Tin Toy short, as well as the THX certification.[90] The twin-pack release was later released individually on March 20, 2001. The DVD two-pack, the Ultimate Toy Box set, the Gold Classic Collection VHS and DVD, and the original DVD were all put in the Disney Vault on May 1, 2003.[91] On September 6, 2005, a 2-disc \"10th Anniversary Edition\" was released featuring much of the bonus material from the \"Ultimate Toy Box\", including a retrospective special with John Lasseter and a brand new DTS sound mix.[92] This DVD went back in the Disney Vault on January 31, 2009, along with Toy Story 2. The 10th Anniversary release was the last version of Toy Story to be released before being taken out of the Disney Vault lineup along with Toy Story 2.[93] Also on September 6, 2005, a UMD of Toy Story featuring some deleted scenes, a filmmakers\\' reflect, and a new \"Legacy of Toy Story\" was released for the Sony PlayStation Portable.\\n Toy Story was available for the first time on Blu-ray in a Special Edition Combo Pack that included two discs, the Blu-ray, and the DVD versions of the film. This combo-edition was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on March 23, 2010, along with its sequel.[94] There was a DVD-only re-release on May 11, 2010.[95] Another \"Ultimate Toy Box\", packaging the Combo Pack with those of both sequels, became available on November 2, 2010. On November 1, 2011, the first three Toy Story films were re-released all together, each as a DVD/Blu-ray/Blu-ray 3D/Digital Copy combo pack (four discs each for the first two films, and five for the third film). They were also released on Blu-ray 3D in a complete trilogy box set. The film had a re-release on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 4, 2019.[96]\\n Yes, we worry about what the critics say. Yes, we worry about what the opening box office is going to be. Yes, we worry about what the final box office is going to be. But really, the whole point of why we do what we do is to entertain our audiences. The greatest joy I get as a filmmaker is to slip into an audience for one of our movies anonymously and watch people watch our film. Because people are 100 percent honest when they\\'re watching a movie. And to see the joy on people\\'s faces, to see people really get into our films... to me is the greatest reward I could get.\\n —John Lasseter, reflecting on the impact of the film[97] Before the film\\'s release, executive producer and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs stated \"If Toy Story is a modest hit—say $75\\xa0million at the box office, we\\'ll [Pixar and Disney] both break even. If it gets $100\\xa0million, we\\'ll both make money. But if it\\'s a real blockbuster and earns $200\\xa0million or so at the box office, we\\'ll make good money, and Disney will make a lot of money.\" Upon its release on November 22, 1995, Toy Story managed to gross more than $350\\xa0million worldwide.[59] Disney chairman Michael Eisner stated \"I don\\'t think either side thought Toy Story would turn out as well as it has. The technology is brilliant, the casting is inspired, and I think the story will touch a nerve. Believe me, when we first agreed to work together, we never thought their first movie would be our 1995 holiday feature, or that they could go public on the strength of it.\"[59]\\n The film\\'s first five days of domestic release (on Thanksgiving weekend) earned it $39.1 million.[98] Moreover, Toy Story earned a total of $158.6 million from ticket sales combined with the five-day Wednesday opening.[99] It would go on to hold this record until Independence Day took it the next year.[100] The film placed first in the weekend\\'s box office with $29.1\\xa0million[3] and maintained the number-one position at the domestic box office for the next two weekends. It was displaced by Jumanji in its fourth weekend, but still remained ahead of Heat with $10.9 million.[101] Toy Story went on to become the highest-grossing domestic film of 1995, beating Batman Forever, Apollo 13 (also starring Tom Hanks), Pocahontas, Casper, Waterworld, GoldenEye, and other films.[102] At the time of its release, it was the third-highest-grossing animated film of all time, after The Lion King (1994) and Aladdin (1992).[17] Toy Story became the second-highest-grossing film of 1995, just $3 million behind Die Hard with a Vengeance.[103] When not considering inflation, Toy Story is number 96 on the list of the highest-grossing domestic films of all time.[104] The film had gross receipts of $223.2\\xa0million in the U.S. and Canada and $171.2\\xa0million in international markets from its original 1995 release and three re-releases for a total of $394.4\\xa0million worldwide.[3] At the time of its release, the film ranked as the 17th-highest-grossing film (unadjusted) domestically and the 21st-highest-grossing film worldwide.\\n Toy Story has an approval rating of 100% based on 96 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 9.1/10. Its critical consensus reads, \"Entertaining as it is innovative, Toy Story reinvigorated animation while heralding the arrival of Pixar as a family-friendly force to be reckoned with.\"[105] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned Toy Story a score of 96 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[106] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[107]\\n Particular praise was offered for the film\\'s 3D animation. Leonard Klady of Variety commended its \"razzle-dazzle technique and unusual look\" and said that \"the camera loops and zooms in a dizzying fashion that fairly takes one\\'s breath away.\"[108] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared the animation to Disney\\'s Who Framed Roger Rabbit, saying that \"both movies take apart the universe of cinematic visuals and put it back together again, allowing us to see in a new way.\"[109] Due to the film\\'s creative animation, Richard Corliss of TIME claimed that it was \"the year\\'s most inventive comedy\".[110]\\n The voice cast was also praised by various critics. Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today approved of the selection of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen for the lead roles.[111] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated that \"Starting with Tom Hanks, who brings an invaluable heft and believability to Woody, Toy Story is one of the best voiced animated features in memory, with all the actors ... making their presences strongly felt.\"[112]\\n Several critics also recognized the film\\'s ability to appeal to various age groups.[109][113] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote \"It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of imagination, that\\'s the hallmark of the greatest children\\'s films. It also has the kind of spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids.\"[114]\\n In 1995, Toy Story was ranked eighth in TIME\\'s list of the \"Best 10 films of 1995\".[115] In 2011, TIME named it one of the \"25 All-TIME Best Animated Films\".[116]\\nIt also ranks at number 99 in Empire magazine\\'s list of the \"500 Greatest Films of All Time\" and as the \"highest-ranked animated movie\".[117]\\n In 2003, the Online Film Critics Society ranked the film as the greatest animated film of all time.[118] In 2007, the Visual Effects Society named the film 22nd in its list of the \"Top 50 Most Influential Visual Effects Films of All Time\".[119] The film is ranked 99th on the AFI\\'s list of the \"100 greatest American Films of All-Time\".[120][121][122] It was one of the only two animated films on that list, the other being Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). It was also the sixth best in the animation genre on AFI\\'s 10 Top 10.\\n In more recent years, director Terry Gilliam has praised the film as \"a work of genius. It got people to understand what toys are about. They\\'re true to their own character. And that\\'s just brilliant. It\\'s got a shot that\\'s always stuck with me when Buzz Lightyear discovers he\\'s a toy. He\\'s sitting on this landing at the top of the staircase and the camera pulls back and he\\'s this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it\\'s stunning. I\\'d put that as one of my top ten films, period.\"[123]\\n The film won and was nominated for various other awards including a Kids\\' Choice Award, MTV Movie Award, and a British Academy Film Award, among others. John Lasseter received a Special Achievement Academy Award in 1996 \"for the development and inspired application of techniques that have made possible the first feature-length computer-animated film\".[124][125] Additionally, the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, two to Randy Newman for Best Music—Original Song, for \"You\\'ve Got a Friend in Me\", and Best Music—Original Musical or Comedy Score.[126] It was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay for the work by Joel Cohen, Pete Docter, John Lasseter, Joe Ranft, Alec Sokolow, Andrew Stanton and Joss Whedon, making it the first animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award writing category.[126]\\n Toy Story won eight Annie Awards, including Best Animated Feature. Animator Pete Docter, director John Lasseter, musician Randy Newman, producers Bonnie Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim, production designer Ralph Eggleston, and writers Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow, Andrew Stanton, and Joss Whedon all won awards for Best Individual Achievement in their respective fields for their work on the film. The film also won Best Individual Achievement in technical achievement.[127]\\n Toy Story was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards, one for Best Motion Picture—Comedy or Musical, and one for Best Original Song—Motion Picture for Newman\\'s \"You\\'ve Got a Friend in Me\".[128] At both the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards, the film won \"Best Animated Film\".[129][130] Toy Story is also among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14, and the highest-placed (at No. 99) animated film in Empire magazine\\'s list of \"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\".[131] In 2005, Toy Story, along with Toy Story 2 was voted the fourth greatest cartoon in Channel 4\\'s 100 Greatest Cartoons poll, behind The Simpsons, Tom and Jerry, and South Park.[132]\\n Toy Story had a large effect on the film industry with its innovative computer animation. After the film\\'s debut, various industries were interested in the technology used for the film. Graphics chip makers desired to compute imagery similar to the film\\'s animation for personal computers, game developers wanted to learn how to replicate the animation for video games, and robotics researchers were interested in building artificial intelligence into their machines that compared to the film\\'s lifelike characters.[134] Various authors have also compared the film to an interpretation of Don Quixote as well as humanism.[135][136] In addition, Toy Story left an impact with its catchphrase \"To Infinity and Beyond\", sequels, and software, among others. In 2005, Toy Story was selected by the United States Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[137][138]\\n Buzz Lightyear\\'s line \"To Infinity and Beyond!\" has been used not only on themed merchandise, but among philosophers and mathematical theorists as well.[139][140][141] In 2008, during STS-124, astronauts took an action figure of Buzz Lightyear into space on Space Shuttle Discovery as part of an educational experience for students while stressing the catchphrase. The action figure was used for experiments in zero-g.[142] It was reported in 2008 that a father and son had continually repeated the phrase to help them keep track of each other while treading water for 15 hours in the Atlantic Ocean.[143] The phrase occurs in the lyrics of Beyoncé\\'s 2008 song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", during the bridge.[144] In 2012, the late Capital STEEZ released a song titled \"Infinity and Beyond\" in reference to the phrase as part of his AmeriKKKan Korruption mixtape.[145]\\n Disney has also recycled the phrase in homage to Toy Story at least twice. In the \"blooper reel\" shown during the credits of A Bug\\'s Life, Dave Foley says the line while in character as Flik, and Tim Allen himself repeated his famous line in The Shaggy Dog, in a scene when the titular character jumps off a bridge onto a moving vehicle.[146]\\n Toy Story\\'s cast of characters forms the basis for the naming of the releases of the Debian computer operating system, from Debian 1.1 Buzz, the first release with a codename, in 1996, to Debian 14 Forky, the most-recently announced future release.[147][148]\\n In 2013, Pixar designed a \"Gromit Lightyear\" sculpture based on the Aardman Animations character Gromit for Gromit Unleashed, which sold for £65,000.[149]\\n The first sequel, titled Toy Story 2, was released on November 24, 1999. In the film, Woody is stolen by a toy collector, leading Buzz and his friends to launch a rescue mission. Initially, Toy Story 2 was going to be a direct-to-video release, with development beginning in 1996.[150] However, after the cast from Toy Story returned and the story was considered to be better than that of a direct-to-video release, it was announced in 1998 that the sequel would see a theatrical release.[151]\\n Toy Story 3 was released on June 18, 2010. In the film, Andy\\'s toys are accidentally donated to a day-care center as he prepares to leave for college.\\n Toy Story 4 was released on June 21, 2019,[152] with most of the main cast returning for the film.[153] In the film, Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang get used to living with Bonnie, who creates a new toy named Forky, from recycled materials from school. As they go on a road trip with Bonnie, Woody is also reunited with Bo Peep, and must decide where his loyalties lie.\\n A spin-off film, Lightyear, was released on June 17, 2022, with Chris Evans portraying the original Buzz Lightyear, upon whom the toy given to Andy in the first film was based.\\n On February 8, 2023, Disney announced that a fifth Toy Story film is in development.[154]', 'Finding Nemo is a 2003 American animated comedy-drama adventure film[2] produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by Andrew Stanton and co-directed by Lee Unkrich, the screenplay was written by Stanton, Bob Peterson, and David Reynolds from a story by Stanton. The film stars the voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, Willem Dafoe, and Geoffrey Rush. It tells the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin (Brooks) who, along with a forgetful regal blue tang named Dory (DeGeneres), searches for his missing son Nemo (Gould). Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself.\\n Pre-production of the film began in 1997. The inspiration for Finding Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to Stanton\\'s childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. Thomas Newman composed the score for the film.\\n Premiering in Los Angeles on May 18, Finding Nemo was released in theaters in the United States on May 30, 2003. Upon its release, it received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the visual elements, screenplay, animation, Newman\\'s score and characters that have been cited as funny to both young moviegoers and their parents.[3] It became the highest-grossing animated film at the time of its release, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2003, earning a total of $871\\xa0million worldwide by the end of its initial theatrical run.[4] The film received four nominations at the 76th Academy Awards, and won the award for Best Animated Feature, becoming the first Pixar film to do so.\\n Finding Nemo is the best-selling DVD title of all time, with over 40 million copies sold as of 2006[update],[5] and was the highest-grossing G-rated film of all time before Pixar\\'s own Toy Story 3 overtook it. The film was re-released in 3D in 2012. In 2008, the American Film Institute named it as the 10th greatest American animated film as part of their 10 Top 10 lists.[6] A sequel, Finding Dory, was released in June 2016.\\n A clownfish named Marlin and his wife, Coral, live happily in an anemone in the Great Barrier Reef. They are about to become parents, waiting for their many eggs to hatch. Suddenly, a barracuda approaches the anemone; Coral rushes to protect her eggs as the barracuda knocks Marlin unconscious. Upon awakening, Marlin discovers that Coral and all but one of the eggs have been eaten by the barracuda; the last remaining egg is cracked. Marlin vows to keep his only surviving child safe.\\n Marlin becomes overprotective of his son, Nemo. On Nemo\\'s first day at school, the two have a heated argument regarding Marlin\\'s parenting approach. Nemo defiantly swims to a speedboat and is captured by a pair of scuba divers. Marlin frantically pursues the boat in vain. Marlin meets Dory, a blue tang with acute short-term memory loss, who offers to help him. The two encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating fish. Marlin finds a diver\\'s mask that fell from the boat and accidentally injures Dory with it. The scent of her blood sends Bruce into a frenzy and he accidentally sets off old naval mines; the sharks, Marlin, and Dory are able to swim to safety before the mines blow up.\\n Nemo is placed in a fish tank in the office of dentist Philip Sherman in Sydney. He meets the \"Tank Gang\", led by Gill, a scarred Moorish idol. Sherman plans to give Nemo to his niece, Darla, who killed her previous pet fish as a result of her careless treatment. Gill, who also wishes to return to the ocean, devises an escape plan: Nemo, the smallest fish in the tank, will block the aquarium\\'s filter tube with a pebble, obliging Sherman to put the fish into bags while he cleans the tank. This will allow them to roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to block the filter but fails and is almost killed by the filter\\'s machinery, causing Gill to feel deeply regretful.\\n The diver\\'s mask falls into a deep trench. As Marlin and Dory search for it, they are attacked by an anglerfish but manage to trap it using the mask. Dory memorizes the address written on the mask. A school of moonfish give the pair directions to the East Australian Current. On their way, Marlin and Dory become trapped in a forest of jellyfish. After being stung and knocked unconscious, they awaken in the East Australian Current with a large group of sea turtles, including Crush and his son, Squirt. The story of Marlin\\'s quest is relayed by the turtles all across the ocean to Sydney, where it reaches Nigel, a pelican who regularly converses with the Tank Gang. Nigel tells the Tank Gang of Marlin\\'s journey, motivating Nemo to try blocking the filter again. Nemo is successful, and the aquarium quickly becomes covered in green algae.\\n After exiting the current, Marlin and Dory get lost and are consumed by a blue whale. The whale expels them through its blowhole into Sydney Harbour. Nigel finds Marlin and Dory, and, after rescuing them from a flock of ravenous seagulls, takes them to Sherman\\'s office, where Nemo is playing dead to avoid being given to Darla; this causes Marlin to believe Nemo is really dead. Sherman forces Nigel out of his office, and Gill helps Nemo escape through the sink drain that leads to the ocean.\\n Deeply shaken, Marlin mournfully says goodbye to Dory and begins heading home. Nemo meets Dory, who helps him reunite with Marlin. However, a fishing trawler captures her in a net along with a school of groupers. Nemo and Marlin work together, instructing the fish to swim down. Their combined force breaks the beam of the trawler, freeing the fish. \\n Some time later, Marlin, who has become more confident and outgoing, drops Nemo off at school. Dory joins Marlin, and together, they wave goodbye to Nemo as he leaves with his class. Meanwhile, after the dentist\\'s new filter breaks, the Tank Gang escapes into Sydney Harbour in their plastic bags. Now successfully in the ocean but still stuck in the bags, they ponder what to do next.\\n [7]\\n The inspiration for Finding Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to director Andrew Stanton\\'s childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home.[8] In 1992, shortly after his son was born, he and his family took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation.[9] Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.[8]\\n In an interview with National Geographic magazine, Stanton said that the idea for the characters of Marlin and Nemo came from a photograph of two clownfish peeking out of an anemone:\\n It was so arresting. I had no idea what kind of fish they were, but I couldn\\'t take my eyes off them. And as an entertainer, the fact that they were called clownfish—it was perfect. There\\'s almost nothing more appealing than these little fish that want to play peekaboo with you.[10]\\n In addition, clownfish are colorful, but do not tend to come out of an anemone often. For a character who has to go on a dangerous journey, Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect type of fish for the character.[8] Pre-production of the film began in early 1997. Stanton began writing the screenplay during the post-production of A Bug\\'s Life. As a result, Finding Nemo began production with a complete screenplay, something that co-director Lee Unkrich called \"very unusual for an animated film\".[8] The artists took scuba diving lessons to study the coral reef.[8]\\n Stanton originally planned to use flashbacks to reveal how Coral died but realized that by the end of the film there would be nothing to reveal, deciding to show how she died at the beginning of the movie.[8] The character of Gill also was different from the character seen in the final film. In a scene that was eventually deleted, Gill tells Nemo that he\\'s from a place called Bad Luck Bay and that he has brothers and sisters in order to impress the young clownfish, only for the latter to find out that he was lying by listening to a patient reading a children\\'s storybook that shares exactly the same details.[8]\\n William H. Macy was the first actor cast as Marlin. Although Macy had recorded most of the dialogue, Stanton felt that the character needed a lighter touch.[11] Stanton then cast Albert Brooks in the role, and in his opinion, it \"saved\" the film.[8] Brooks liked the idea of Marlin being this clownfish who isn\\'t funny and recorded outtakes of telling very bad jokes.\\n The idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Stanton and Bob Peterson while they were driving to record the actors. Although he originally envisioned the character of Dory as male, Stanton was inspired to cast Ellen DeGeneres when he watched an episode of Ellen in which he saw her \"change the subject five times before finishing one sentence\".[8] The pelican character named Gerald (who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory) was originally a friend of Nigel. They were going to play against each other with Nigel being neat and fastidious and Gerald being scruffy and sloppy. The filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did not slow the pace of the picture, so Gerald\\'s character was minimized.[8]\\n Stanton himself provided the voice of Crush the sea turtle. He originally did the voice for the film\\'s story reel and assumed they would find an actor later. When Stanton\\'s performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film. He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in Unkrich\\'s office.[8] Crush\\'s son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director Brad Bird. According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. Stanton felt the voice was \"this generation\\'s Thumper\" and immediately cast Nicholas.[8]\\n Megan Mullally was originally going to provide a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were stunned to learn that the voice of her character Karen Walker on the television show Will & Grace was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed.[12]\\n To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. They visited aquariums, went diving in Hawaii, and received in-house lectures from an ichthyologist.[13] As a result, Pixar\\'s animator for Dory, Gini Cruz Santos, integrated \"the fish movement, human movement, and facial expressions to make them look and feel like real characters.\"[14] Production designer Ralph Eggleston created pastel drawings to give the lighting crew led by Sharon Calahan ideas of how every scene in the film should be lit.[15]\\n The Great white shark, Bruce, is in reference to the animatronic shark used in the Universal film Jaws. The shark they had used on set was nicknamed \"Bruce\" after Bruce Raiman, who was Steven Spielberg\\'s divorce lawyer.[16] The line \"Here\\'s Brucey!\" is a reference to the Jack Nicholson line from the 1980 horror film, The Shining.[17] Additionally, the music that plays for the dentist\\'s niece Darla is the theme music from the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film, Psycho.[18]\\n The film was dedicated to Glenn McQueen, a Pixar animator who died of melanoma in October 2002.[19] Finding Nemo shares many plot elements with Pierrot the Clownfish,[20] a children\\'s book published in 2002, but allegedly conceived in 1995. The author, Franck Le Calvez, sued Disney for infringement of his intellectual rights and to bar Finding Nemo merchandise in France. The judge ruled against him, citing the color differences between Pierrot and Nemo.[21]\\n In 2016, Disney Character Voices International\\'s senior vice president Rick Dempsey, in collaboration with the Navajo Nation Museum, created a Navajo dubbing of the movie titled Nemo Há’déést’íí which was released in theaters March 18–24 of the same year.[22][23] The project was thought as a means to preserve Navajo language, teaching the language to kids through a Disney movie.[24] The studio held auditions on the reservation, but finding an age-appropriate native speaker to voice Nemo was hard, Dempsey said, as the majority of native Navajo speakers are over 40 years old.[23] The end credits version of the song \"Beyond the Sea\", covered in the English version by Robbie Williams, was also adapted into Navajo, with Fall Out Boy\\'s lead singer Patrick Stump performing it.[25] In 2016, Finding Nemo was the second movie to receive a dub in Navajo, after Star Wars.[26]\\n Finding Nemo was the first Pixar film not to be scored by Randy Newman. The original soundtrack album was instead scored by Thomas Newman, his cousin, and released on May 20, 2003.[27][28] The score was nominated for the Academy Award for Original Score, losing to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.[29]\\n Disney released a teaser trailer of Finding Nemo in June 2002, being first attached to the theatrical release of Lilo & Stitch. The teaser was later attached to the theatrical screenings of Hey Arnold!: The Movie, The Powerpuff Girls Movie, Stuart Little 2 and Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie. The teaser was also attached to the Monsters, Inc. home video release and other Disney home video releases. The next trailer for the film was released in October 2002 and was attached to the theatrical screenings of Treasure Planet and The Wild Thornberrys Movie. The third trailer for the film was released in February 2003 and was attached to the theatrical screening of The Jungle Book 2. The fourth and final trailer for the film was released in March 2003 and was attached to the theatrical screening of Piglet\\'s Big Movie.\\n McDonald\\'s restaurants began to sell eight Happy Meal toys based on the film.[30] At the 100th North American International Toy Fair event in New York City, Hasbro unveiled a variety of Finding Nemo toys.[31] A cereal themed to the film was released by Kellogg\\'s, consisting of naturally sweetened oats with fish-shaped marshmallows.[32] Finding Nemo was advertised as promotional partners on other companies, like Frito-Lay, Keebler, Pepsi, Ralphs, Dreyer\\'s, Jel Sert, Airheads, Orville Redenbacher\\'s, and THQ. Before May 26, 2003, stickers on over 50 million bags of potato chips alerted consumers to a sweepstakes dangling a trip for four to Sydney, Australia with a visit to the Great Barrier Reef. On May 17, 2003, Frito-Lay hosted an event at each of the Walmart stores, where kids could use 3D goggles to find hidden images of Nemo. Kellogg\\'s packed eight different water toys depicting film characters inside Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Honey Smacks and Cocoa Rice Krispies cereal boxes. The Honey Smacks, Frosted Flakes, Cinnamon Crunch Crispix and Froot Loops boxes also carried a Nemo memory card game on back panels. Plus, a Nemo-themed Marshmallow Froot Loops cereal featured four of the film\\'s characters. Consumers could mail in two UPCs from the three Kellogg\\'s cereals to receive a large beach towel. Besides this, the company unveiled a new type of Pop-Tarts inspired by Finding Nemo. Known as the Great Berry Reef Pop-Tarts, they had a wild berry filling and fish sprinkles. A pool raft was available with two Pop-Tart UPCs and shipping, handled by Draft Worldwide of Chicago. Eggo waffles would offer holographic swimming goggles with the purchase of two of its products with shipping and handling. For their snacks division, Kellogg\\'s offered consumers who purchased two packages of select products and two gallons of milk with a giant inflatable shark. The company advertised the film on Vanilla Wafers, Chips Deluxe, Mini Fudge Shoppe Fudge Stripes, Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies, Rice Krispies Treats and limited edition Nemo-themed cookies.[33]\\n On May 20, 2003, Kellogg\\'s recalled Frosted Flakes cereal boxes due to their extremely close resemblance of a Hasbro memory card game. A lawsuit was filed against the company, which included a full-page reproduction of the front of a Frosted Flakes box with the cereal\\'s familiar Tony the Tiger mascot grinning next to Nemo, Dory and Crush from the film. Disney had licensed the characters to use on the game cards. Hasbro had filed the suit to protect its trademark against blatant infringement.[34]\\n Finding Nemo was not only the fifth Pixar film, but was also the first one to be released during the summer instead of November, much like its four predecessors.[35] The film premiered in Los Angeles on May 18, 2003,[36] and opened in theaters with The Italian Job and Wrong Turn on May 30, 2003.[37]\\n Finding Nemo was released on VHS and DVD on November 4, 2003, both THX-certified and taken from the digital source.[38][39] The film\\'s 2-disc Collector\\'s Edition DVD release sold more than 8 million copies on its first day of release, breaking Spider-Man\\'s record for having the highest single-day DVD sales.[40][41] It also surpassed Monsters, Inc. for having the highest single-day record for an animated movie.[40] Within two weeks, it went on to become the best-selling DVD of its time, selling over 15 million copies and beating The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.[42] With over 40 million copies sold, Finding Nemo currently holds the record for the best-selling DVD release of all time.[43] The first disc features a widescreen version, documentaries, galleries and an audio/visual commentary, and the second disc features a full-frame version, games, sneak peeks of other films (including The Incredibles and Home on the Range), bonus shorts (Knick Knack, which was shown alongside the film in theaters, and Exploring the Reef), and the advertising campaign.[44] Both discs also feature introductions from Stanton and Unkrich and \"virtual aquariums\" based on the film\\'s various settings.[45][44]\\n The film was then released on both Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray on December 4, 2012, with both a 3-disc and a 5-disc set.[46] In 2019, Finding Nemo was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray.[47][48]\\n During its original theatrical run, Finding Nemo grossed $339.7 million in the United States and Canada and $531.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $871.0 million.[4] It was the second-highest-grossing film of 2003, behind The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.[49][50] Finding Nemo also defeated The Matrix Reloaded to become the highest-grossing film of the 2003 summer season.[51] The film sold an estimated 56.4 million tickets in the United States during its initial theatrical run.[1]\\n On its opening weekend, Finding Nemo earned $70.6 million in the United States and Canada.[52] When the film opened, it was ranked number one at the box office, dethroning Bruce Almighty and The Italian Job.[53] Additionally, it surpassed its predecessor Monsters, Inc. for having the highest domestic opening weekend for an animated film.[53] It would hold this record until Shrek 2 took it the following year.[54] Finding Nemo achieved the third-highest opening weekend for a 2003 film at the time of its release, behind The Matrix Reloaded and X2.[55] During its second weekend, the film dropped to second place behind 2 Fast 2 Furious.[56] It declined by 34% while making $45.8 million.[57] Nevertheless, the film returned to the number one spot the following week. At that point, it earned $29.2 million, bringing the total domestic gross to $192.3 million. Finding Nemo was the first film to reclaim the number one spot since Die Another Day and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets in 2002.[58] It would also outgross the weaker openings of Rugrats Go Wild, Hollywood Homicide and Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd.[59] By the film\\'s 20th day of release, Finding Nemo had earned over $200 million.[60] During the film\\'s fourth weekend, it was overtaken by Hulk.[61] Despite this, Finding Nemo continued to draw in large crowds and families throughout the summer season while outgrossing another animated film, Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas.[62]\\n By July 2003, Finding Nemo had earned $274.9 million, beating The Matrix Reloaded and becoming the top-grossing movie of the year.[63] The film even surpassed Shrek to become the second highest-grossing animated film.[64] Later that month, the film had earned over $300 million, becoming the highest-grossing animated film in the United States and Canada, surpassing The Lion King.[65] By the end of the summer season, Finding Nemo was one of five films to reach $200 million at the box office in a single summer season, with the others being X2, The Matrix Reloaded, Bruce Almighty and Disney\\'s own Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.[66] At the end of its theatrical run, Finding Nemo grossed $339.7\\xa0million in the United States and Canada and $531.3\\xa0million in international territories, totaling $871.0\\xa0million worldwide. In all three occasions, it had outgrossed The Lion King to become the highest-grossing animated film. It stayed in the Top 10 until August 14 (11 weeks total).[67] In North America, it was surpassed by both Shrek 2 in 2004 and Toy Story 3 in 2010.[68] Finding Nemo would hold the record for having the highest international gross for an animated film until 2009 when it was taken by Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs.[69] Outside North America, it stands as the fifth highest-grossing animated film. Worldwide, it currently ranks as the ninth highest-grossing animated film. Moreover, it was the highest-grossing Disney film for three years before Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\\'s Chest surpassed it.[70] Finding Nemo was also the fourth animated film to make $500 million worldwide, joining Monsters, Inc., Aladdin and The Lion King.[71]\\n The film had impressive box office runs in many international markets. In Japan, its highest-grossing market after North America, it grossed ¥11.2\\xa0billion ($102.4\\xa0million), becoming the highest-grossing foreign animated film in local currency (yen).[72] It has only been surpassed by Frozen (¥25.5\\xa0billion).[73] Plus, Finding Nemo was the second film by Buena Vista Pictures to reach $100 million in the country, just after Armageddon in 1999.[74] In Mexico, it earned $4.7\\xa0million, making it the country\\'s second-highest opening weekend, behind Spider-Man.[75] The film also grossed £37.2\\xa0million ($67.1\\xa0million) in the U.K., Ireland, and Malta.[76] At the Manchester UCI Cinemas, it made a total three-day opening gross of £17,150 ($28,583), becoming the theater\\'s highest-grossing digital film at the time, surpassing Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones and numerous other releases.[77] Making £28.7\\xa0million ($35.7\\xa0million), Finding Nemo was the highest-grossing film released in October 2003 in the region, beating Bad Boys II.[78] Following in biggest grosses are France and the Maghreb region ($64.8\\xa0million), Germany ($53.9\\xa0million), and Spain ($29.5\\xa0million).[76]\\n After the success of the 3D re-release of The Lion King, Disney re-released Finding Nemo in 3D on September 14, 2012,[79] with a conversion cost estimated to be below $5\\xa0million.[80] For the opening weekend of its 3D re-release in North America, Finding Nemo grossed $16.7\\xa0million, debuting at the No. 2 spot behind Resident Evil: Retribution.[81] The film earned $41.1\\xa0million in North America and $28.2\\xa0million internationally, for a combined total of $69.3\\xa0million, and a cumulative worldwide total of $940.3\\xa0million.[1]\\n On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 99% of 270 critics\\' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The website\\'s consensus reads, \"Breathtakingly lovely and grounded by the stellar efforts of a well-chosen cast, Finding Nemo adds another beautifully crafted gem to Pixar\\'s crown.\"[82] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100 based on 38 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[83] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale.[84]\\n Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, calling it \"one of those rare movies where I wanted to sit in the front row and let the images wash out to the edges of my field of vision\".[85] Ed Park of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying \"It\\'s an ocean of eye candy that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of SpongeBob SquarePants.\"[86] Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure.\"[87] Hazel-Dawn Dumpert of LA Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying \"As gorgeous a film as Disney\\'s ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy.\"[88] Beth Jones of The Roanoke Times gave Finding Nemo a five out of five rating, explaining that \"several scenes are scarier than Edward Norton\\'s mustache in The Italian Job.\"[89] Jeff Strickler of the Star Tribune gave the film a positive review, saying it \"proves that even when Pixar is not at the top of its game, it still produces better animation than some of its competitors on their best days.\"[88] Gene Seymour of Newsday gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \"The underwater backdrops take your breath away. No, really. They\\'re so lifelike, you almost feel like holding your breath while watching.\"[88] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"Parental anxiety may not be the kind of stuff children\\'s films are usually made of, but this perfectly enchanting movie knows how to cater to its kiddie audience without condescending to them.\"[90]\\n Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film three-and-a-half out of five, saying \"The best break of all is that Pixar\\'s traditionally untethered imagination can\\'t be kept under wraps forever, and \"Nemo\" erupts with sea creatures that showcase Stanton and company\\'s gift for character and peerless eye for skewering contemporary culture.\"[91] Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald said, \"This is not the first time Pixar\\'s animators have been engaged with the natural world, but they\\'ve never been as deeply immersed as they are in this undersea Fantasia.\"[92] Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"Visual imagination and sophisticated wit raise Finding Nemo to a level just below the peaks of Pixar\\'s Toy Story movies and Monsters, Inc..\"[93] Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press gave the film three out of four, saying \"As we now expect from Pixar, even the supporting fish in \"Finding Nemo\" are more developed as characters than any human in the Mission: Impossible movies.\"[94] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and half out of four, saying \"Finding Nemo is an undersea treasure. The most gorgeous of all the Pixar films—which include Toy Story 1 and 2, A Bug\\'s Life and Monsters, Inc.—Nemo treats family audiences to a sweet, resonant story and breathtaking visuals. It may lack Monsters, Inc.\\'s clever humor, but kids will identify with the spunky sea fish Nemo, and adults will relate to Marlin, Nemo\\'s devoted dad.\"[95] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle gave the film an A−, saying \"Finding Nemo lives up to Pixar\\'s high standards for wildly creative visuals, clever comedy, solid characters and an involving story.\"[96] Jack Garner of Gannett News Service gave it a score of ten out of ten, stating that the film \"strikes the perfect balance between the charm and childlike innocence of Disney animation and the cutting-edge humor and hipness of the old Warner Brothers cartoons.\"[97] Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film an A−, saying \"A simple test of humanity: If you don\\'t laugh aloud while watching it, you\\'ve got a battery not a heart.\"[88]\\n Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film four out of four, saying \"Enchanting; written with an effortless blend of sweetness and silliness, and animated with such rainbow-hued beauty, you may find yourself wanting to freeze-frame it.\"[88] Daphne Gordon of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of five, saying \"One of the strongest releases from Disney in years, thanks to the work of Andrew Stanton, possibly one of the most successful directors you\\'ve never heard of.\"[88] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three and a half out of four, saying \"Finding Nemo isn\\'t quite up there with the company\\'s finest work—there\\'s finally a sense of formula setting in—but it\\'s hands down the best family film since Monsters, Inc.\"[88] C.W. Nevius of The San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four, saying \"The visuals pop, the fish emote and the ocean comes alive. That\\'s in the first two minutes. After that, they do some really cool stuff.\"[98] Gregory M. Lamb of The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a rating of three out of four, calling it \"the best animated underwater picture since The Little Mermaid.\"[99] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying \"Finding Nemo will engross kids with its absorbing story, brightly drawn characters and lively action, and grown-ups will be equally entertained by the film\\'s subtle humor and the sophistication of its visuals.\"[88] David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, saying \"A visual marvel, every frame packed to the gills with clever details, Finding Nemo is the best big-studio release so far this year.\"[100]\\n Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying \"Nemo, with its ravishing underwater fantasia, manages to trump the design glamour of earlier Pixar films.\"[101] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A, saying \"In this seamless blending of technical brilliance and storytelling verve, the Pixar team has made something as marvelously soulful and innately, fluidly American as jazz.\"[102] Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three out of four, saying \"As eye-popping as Nemo\\'s peepers and as eccentric as this little fish with asymmetrical fins.\"[88] David Germain of the Associated Press gave the film a positive review, saying \"Finding Nemo is laced with smart humor and clever gags, and buoyed by another cheery story of mismatched buddies: a pair of fish voiced by Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres.\"[103] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review, saying \"The latest flood of wizardry from Pixar, whose productions, from Toy Story onward, have lent an indispensable vigor and wit to the sagging art of mainstream animation.\"[104] The 3D re-release prompted a retrospective on the film nine years after its initial release. Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger described it as \"a genuinely funny and touching film that, in less than a decade, has established itself as a timeless classic.\"[105] On the 3D re-release, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote that its emotional power was deepened by \"the dimensionality of the oceanic deep\" where \"the spatial mysteries of watery currents and floating worlds are exactly where 3D explorers were born to boldly go\".[106]\\n Finding Nemo was included on a number of best-of lists. The film appeared on professional rankings from BBC and The Independent based on retrospective appraisal, as one of the greatest films of the twenty-first century.[107][108] Several publications have listed it as one of the best animated films, including: IGN (2010),[109] Insider, USA Today, Elle (all 2018),[110][111][112] Parade, Complex, and Time Out New York (all 2021).[113][114][115] In December 2021, the film\\'s screenplay was listed number 60 on the Writers Guild of America\\'s \"101 Greatest Screenplays of the 21st Century (So Far)\".[116]\\n At the 76th Academy Awards, Finding Nemo became the first Pixar film to win the Best Animated Feature category, defeating Brother Bear and The Triplets of Belleville.[29][117] The film received two more Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound Editing, losing both to Lost in Translation and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World respectively.[29] It also won the award for Best Animated Film at the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards, the Saturn Awards the Las Vegas Film Critics Society Awards, the National Board of Review Awards, the Online Film Critics Society Awards, and the Toronto Film Critics Association Awards.[118] The film received many other awards, including: Kids Choice Awards for Favorite Movie and Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie (Ellen DeGeneres), and the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress (Ellen DeGeneres).[118]\\n The film was also nominated for two Chicago Film Critics Association Awards, for Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress (Ellen DeGeneres), a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture\\xa0– Musical or Comedy, and two MTV Movie Awards, for Best Movie and Best Comedic Performance (Ellen DeGeneres).[118]\\n In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"Ten Top Ten\", the best 10 films in 10 \"classic\" American film genres, after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. Finding Nemo was acknowledged as the 10th best film in the animation genre.[6] It was the most recently released film among all 10 lists, and one of only three movies made after the year 2000 (the others being The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and Shrek).[119]\\n American Film Institute recognition:\\n The film\\'s use of clownfish prompted mass purchase of the fish breed as pets in the United States, even though the story portrayed the use of fish as pets negatively and suggested that saltwater aquariums are notably tricky and expensive to maintain.[120] The demand for clownfish was supplied by large-scale harvesting of tropical fish in regions like Vanuatu.[121] The Australian Tourism Commission (ATC) launched several marketing campaigns in China and the United States to improve tourism in Australia, many of them utilizing Finding Nemo clips.[122][123] Queensland used Finding Nemo to draw tourists to promote itself to vacationers.[124] According to National Geographic, \"Ironically, Finding Nemo, a movie about the anguish of a captured clownfish, caused home-aquarium demand for them to triple.\"[125]\\n The reaction to the film by the general public has led to environmental devastation for the clownfish, and has provoked an outcry from several environmental protection agencies, including the Marine Aquarium Council, Australia. [citation needed] The demand for tropical fish skyrocketed after the film\\'s release, causing reef species decimation in Vanuatu and several other reef areas.[126] After seeing the film, some aquarium owners released their pet fish into the ocean, but failed to release them into the correct oceanic habitat, which introduced species that are harmful to the indigenous environment, a practice that is harming reefs worldwide.[127][128]\\n A 2017 study by researchers from James Cook University in Australia found little evidence for fan-based purchases of wild-caught fish immediately (within 1.5 years of release) following the film.[129]\\n A spin-off sequel[b] to this film was released in June 2016, titled Finding Dory.[136] It focuses on Dory having a journey to reunite with her parents (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy).[131][137] Like the previous film, Finding Dory was a financial success and fared well with critics.[138][139]\\n A video game based on the film was released in 2003, for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. The goal of the game is to complete different levels under the roles of Nemo, Marlin or Dory. It includes cut scenes from the movie, and each clip is based on a level. It was also the last Pixar game developed by Traveller\\'s Tales. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews.[140][141][142][143][144][145] A Game Boy Advance sequel, titled Finding Nemo: The Continuing Adventures, was released in 2004.[146]\\n Finding Nemo has inspired numerous attractions and properties at Disney Parks around the world, including: Turtle Talk with Crush, which opened in 2004 at Epcot, 2005 in Disney California Adventure Park, 2008 in Hong Kong Disneyland, and 2009 in Tokyo DisneySea; Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, which opened in 2007 in Disneyland Park; The Seas with Nemo & Friends, which opened in 2007 at Epcot; Finding Nemo – The Musical, which opened in 2007 in Disney\\'s Animal Kingdom; and Crush\\'s Coaster, which opened in 2007 at Walt Disney Studios Park.[147][148][149]', 'The Incredibles is a 2004 American animated superhero film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Written and directed by Brad Bird, it stars the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell, Spencer Fox, Jason Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Elizabeth Peña. Set in a retro-futuristic version of the 1960s,[5][6][7] the film follows Bob and Helen Parr, a couple of superheroes, known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, respectively, who hide their powers in accordance with a government mandate, and attempt to live a quiet suburban life with their three children. However, Bob\\'s desire to help people draws the entire family into a confrontation with a vengeful fan-turned-foe.\\n Bird, who was Pixar\\'s first outside director, developed the film as an extension of the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after Warner Bros.\\' box office disappointment of his first feature, The Iron Giant (1999), and carried over much of its staff to develop The Incredibles. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Michael Giacchino composed the film\\'s orchestral score.\\n The Incredibles debuted at the El Capitan Theatre on October 24, 2004, and was released in theaters in the United States on November 5. It earned $632\\xa0million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2004. The Incredibles received widespread acclaim from critics, with praise for its animation, screenplay, voice acting, action sequences, sound design, humor, music, and is frequently considered to be one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. The film won Best Animated Feature and Best Sound Editing at the 77th Academy Awards, with two additional nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing, as well as the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature. It was the first entirely animated film to win the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. A sequel, Incredibles 2, was released in June 2018.\\n On the day of his wedding with Helen (alias Elastigirl), superhero Bob Parr (alias Mr. Incredible) thwarts a civilian\\'s attempted suicide by tackling him through a skyscraper window. Bob then discovers supervillain Bomb Voyage robbing the building, but is interrupted by his devoted fanboy Buddy Pine, who wants to be his sidekick. Bob rejects Buddy, and Voyage clips a bomb onto Buddy\\'s cape. Bob gets the bomb off, but it destroys an elevated train track, forcing Bob to stop an oncoming train. After his wedding, Bob is sued for collateral damage by the suicidal civilian and the injured train passengers. Similar lawsuits create a negative public attitude towards superheroes, and the government initiates the Superhero Relocation Program, banning \"supers\" from using their powers in public and forcing them into hiding.\\n Fifteen years later, Bob lives with Helen and their children, Violet, Dash, and baby Jack-Jack, in Metroville. Bob misses his superhero days and resents his mundane job as a claims adjuster, moonlighting as a vigilante with his friend Lucius Best (alias Frozone). One day, Bob\\'s supervisor, Gilbert Huph, stops him from preventing a mugging. A frustrated Bob injures Huph and is dismissed. That evening, a woman named Mirage secretly offers Bob a mission to subdue a giant \"Omnidroid\" robot loose on Nomanisan island. Bob succeeds by tricking the machine into ripping out its own power source. Rejuvenated by the action and higher pay, Bob trains to get back into shape, and asks superhero costume designer Edna Mode to fix a tear in his old suit. Incorrectly assuming Helen knows of Bob\\'s new job, Edna makes new suits for the entire family.\\n Summoned back to Nomanisan, Bob discovers Mirage is working for Buddy, now calling himself Syndrome\" after being embittered by Bob\\'s rejection. Syndrome has become wealthy by inventing weapons that mimic superpowers. He has been perfecting the Omnidroid by luring supers to fight it until it kills them. Syndrome intends to send an Omnidroid to attack Metroville, then defeat it publicly with secret controls, thereby gaining \"hero\" status. He plans to then sell his inventions to the world to make the term \"super\" irrelevant.\\n Helen visits Edna and learns what Bob has been up to. She activates a beacon Edna built into the suits to find Bob, inadvertently causing Bob to be captured while infiltrating Syndrome\\'s base. Helen borrows a private plane to fly to Nomanisan; Violet and Dash stow away, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Despite knowing that there are children on the plane, Syndrome shoots it down. Helen and the kids survive and make it to the island. Disillusioned by Syndrome\\'s callousness, Mirage releases Bob and informs him of his family\\'s survival. Syndrome\\'s guards pursue Dash and Violet, who evade them with their powers and reunite with their parents. Syndrome captures the family before following the Omnidroid to Metroville. Violet uses her powers to free her family, and Mirage helps them reach Metroville.\\n Recognizing Syndrome\\'s remote-control gauntlet as a threat, the Omnidroid disarms Syndrome and knocks him out. The Incredible and Lucius fight the Omnidroid; Helen and the kids retrieve the remote control, allowing Bob to destroy the robot\\'s power source. The Parrs and Lucius are hailed by the public just as Syndrome awakens to see their victory. Returning home, the Parrs find Syndrome abducting Jack-Jack to raise as a sidekick. As Syndrome flies away, Jack-Jack\\'s superpowers manifest, and he escapes Syndrome\\'s hold. Helen rescues the falling baby, and Bob throws his car at Syndrome\\'s plane. Syndrome is pulled into the plane\\'s engine by his cape.\\n Three months later, the Parrs witness the arrival of supervillain the Underminer. They don their masks and suits, ready to face the new threat.\\n The Incredibles as a concept dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during an uncertain point in his film career.[8][9] Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life.[10] During this time, Bird had signed a production deal with Warner Bros. Feature Animation and was in the process of directing his first feature, The Iron Giant.[11] Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life.[10] He stated, \"Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But I think that what was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie.\"[12] After the box office failure of The Iron Giant, Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.[10][11]\\n He imagined it as a homage to the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a 2D cel animation.[10] When The Iron Giant became a box office bomb, he reconnected with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him.[9] Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at CalArts in the 1970s.[13] Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in computer animation. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000.[10] The Incredibles was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters with a history of working for the company.[14] In addition, it would be the studio\\'s first film in which all characters are human.[13]\\n The dad is always expected in the family to be strong, so I made him strong. The moms are always pulled in a million different directions, so I made her stretch like taffy. Teenagers, particularly teenage girls, are insecure and defensive, so I made her turn invisible and turn on shields. And ten-year-old boys are hyperactive energy balls. Babies are unrealized potential.\\n –\\xa0Brad Bird, writer and director of The Incredibles.[15][16] Bird came to Pixar with the lineup of the story\\'s family members worked out: a mom and dad, both suffering through the dad\\'s midlife crisis; a shy teenage girl; a cocky ten-year-old boy; and a baby. Bird had based their powers on family archetypes.[10][16][17] During production, Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli visited Pixar and saw the film\\'s story reels. When Bird asked if the reels made any sense or if they were just \"American nonsense,\" Miyazaki replied, through an interpreter, \"I think it\\'s a very adventurous thing you are trying to do in an American film.\"[18]\\n Syndrome was originally written as a minor character who assaults Bob and Helen at the beginning of the movie, only to die in an explosion that destroys the Parrs\\' house (in this version, the Smiths), but he was made the main antagonist because the filmmakers liked him more than the character of Xerek, who was intended to fulfill that role. The Snug character that Helen talks to at the phone in the final film was intended to fly Helen to Nomanisan Island and to die, but he was removed from that position when Lasseter suggested having Helen pilot the plane herself.[19][20] Syndrome was based on Brad Bird himself.[21]\\n Holly Hunter, cast as Helen Parr/Elastigirl,[22] never voiced an animated character before and saw the role as an exciting opportunity to expand her repertoire. She was also drawn to the film by its unique and \"unconventional story about family and human dynamics\".[22] Bird considered Hunter \"one of the finest actresses in the world\", capable of playing a \"sensitive\" character who also has \"a very sturdy center\". Like Hunter, Craig T. Nelson also had never done an voice role but had wondered about wanting to do a role after he recalled seeing The Iron Giant again; he did his voicework when not working on The District, which he was starring in at the time of the sessions, which took over two years.[22][23][24][25] Spencer Fox was cast as Dash Parr, which was also his feature film debut.[26] Brad Bird wanted to give Dash a realistic out-of-breath voice in certain scenes such as the jungle scene so he made Fox run four laps around the Pixar studio until he got tired.[27] Samuel L. Jackson was cast as Lucius Best/Frozone, Bird cast him because he stated that he wanted the character to have the coolest voice.[28] Lily Tomlin was originally considered for the role of Edna Mode, but later turned it down.[29] After several failed attempts to cast Edna Mode, Bird took on her voice role himself. It was an extension of the Pixar custom of tapping in-house staff whose voices came across particularly well on scratch dialogue tracks.[17] Sarah Vowell was offered the role of Violet unexpectedly;[30] Bird wanted to cast Vowell as Violet after hearing her voice on the National Public Radio program, This American Life.[31][32][33] Bird stated that she was \"perfect\" for the part and immediately called her to offer her the role.[31]\\n Upon Pixar\\'s acceptance of the project, Brad Bird was asked to bring in his own team for the production. He brought up a core group of people he worked with on The Iron Giant. Because of this, many 2D artists had to make the shift to 3D, including Bird himself. Bird found working with CGI \"wonderfully malleable\" in a way that traditional animation is not, calling the camera\\'s ability to easily switch angles in a given scene \"marvelously adaptable.\" He found working in computer animation \"difficult\" in a different way than working traditionally, finding the software \"sophisticated and not particularly friendly.\"[34] Bird wrote the script without knowing the limitations or concerns that went hand-in-hand with the medium of computer animation. As a result, this was to be the most complex film yet for Pixar.[8] The film\\'s characters were designed by Tony Fucile and Teddy Newton, whom Bird had brought with him from Warner Bros.[35] Like most computer-animated films, The Incredibles had a year-long period of building the film from the inside out: modeling the exterior and understanding controls that would work the face and the body—the articulation of the character—before animation could even begin.[34] Bird and Fucile tried to emphasize the graphic quality of good 2D animation to the Pixar team, who had only worked primarily in CGI. Bird attempted to incorporate teaching from Disney\\'s Nine Old Men that the crew at Pixar had \"never really emphasized.\"[34]\\n For the technical crew members, the film\\'s human characters posed a difficult set of challenges.[14] Bird\\'s story was filled with elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely considered to be the most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar\\'s animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion.[9] Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although the technical team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar up until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; in fact, this was integral to her character.[14] Violet\\'s long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair both underwater and blowing through the wind.[34] Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, thinking that a live-action film would be preferable, but Lasseter denied this.[36]\\n The Incredibles was everything that computer-generated animation had trouble doing. It had human characters, it had hair, it had water, it had fire, it had a massive number of sets. The creative heads were excited about the idea of the film, but once I showed story reels of exactly what I wanted, the technical teams turned white. They took one look and thought, \"This will take ten years and cost $500 million. How are we possibly going to do this?\"\\n So I said, \"Give us the black sheep. I want artists who are frustrated. I want the ones who have another way of doing things that nobody\\'s listening to. Give us all the guys who are probably headed out the door.\" A lot of them were malcontents because they saw different ways of doing things, but there was little opportunity to try them, since the established way was working very, very well.\\n We gave the black sheep a chance to prove their theories, and we changed the way a number of things are done here. For less money per minute than was spent on the previous film, Finding Nemo, we did a movie that had three times the number of sets and had everything that was hard to do. All this because the heads of Pixar gave us leave to try crazy ideas.[37]\\n — Brad Bird speaking to McKinsey Quarterly in 2008 Not only did The Incredibles cope with the difficulty of animating CGI humans, but also many other complications. The story was bigger than any prior story at the studio, was longer in running time, and had four times the number of locations.[34][38] Supervising technical director Rick Sayre noted that the hardest thing about the film was that there was \"no hardest thing,\" alluding to the amount of new technical challenges: fire, water, air, smoke, steam, and explosions were all additional to the new difficulty of working with humans.[34] The film\\'s organizational structure could not be mapped out like previous Pixar features, and it became a running joke to the team.[34] Sayre said the team adopted \"Alpha Omega,\" where one team was concerned with building modeling, shading, and layout, while another dealt with final camera, lighting, and effects. Another team, dubbed the \"character team,\" digitally sculpted, rigged, and shaded all of the characters, and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing.[34] There were at least 781 visual effects shots in the film, and they were quite often visual gags, such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts the car door. Additionally, the effects team improved their modeling of clouds, using volumetric rendering for the first time.[34]\\n The skin of the characters gained a new level of realism from a technology to mimic \"subsurface scattering.\"[35] The challenges did not stop with modeling humans. Bird decided that in a shot near the film\\'s end, baby Jack-Jack would have to undergo a series of transformations, and in one of the five planned he would turn himself into a kind of goo. Technical directors, who anticipated spending two months or even longer to work out the goo effect, stealing precious hours from production that had already entered its final and most critical stages, petitioned the film\\'s producer, John Walker, for help. Bird, who had himself brought Walker over from Warner Bros. to work on the project, was at first immovable, but after arguing with Walker in several invective-laced meetings over the course of two months, Bird finally conceded.[39] Bird also insisted that the storyboards define the blocking of characters\\' motions, lighting, and camera movements, which had previously been left to other departments rather than storyboarded.[14]\\n Bird admitted that he \"had the knees of [the studio] trembling under the weight\" of The Incredibles, but called the film a \"testament to the talent of the animators at Pixar,\" who were admiring the challenges the film provoked.[34] He recalled, \"Basically, I came into a wonderful studio, frightened a lot of people with how many presents I wanted for Christmas, and then got almost everything I asked for.\"[36]\\n The Incredibles is the first Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino. Brad Bird was looking for a specific sound as inspired by the film\\'s retrofuturistic design\\xa0– the future as seen from the 1960s. John Barry was the first choice to do the film\\'s score, with a trailer of the film given a rerecording of Barry\\'s theme to On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service. However, Barry did not wish to duplicate the sound of some of his earlier soundtracks;[40] the assignment was instead given to Giacchino.[41] Giacchino noted that recording in the 1960s was largely different from modern day recording and Dan Wallin, the recording engineer, said that Bird wanted an old feel, and as such the score was recorded on analog tapes. Wallin noted that brass instruments, which are at the forefront of the film\\'s score, sound better on analog equipment rather than digital. Wallin came from an era in which music was recorded, according to Giacchino, \"the right way,\" which consists of everyone in the same room, \"playing against each other and feeding off each other\\'s energy.\" Many of Giacchino\\'s future soundtracks followed suit with this style of mixing. Tim Simonec was the conductor/orchestrator for the score\\'s recording.[42]\\n The film\\'s orchestral score was released on November 2, 2004, by Walt Disney Records, three days before the film opened in theaters. It won numerous awards for best score including Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, BMI Film & TV Award, ASCAP Film and Television Music Award, Annie Award, Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award and Online Film Critics Society Award and was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, Satellite Award and Broadcast Film Critics Association Award.[43]\\n Several film reviewers drew precise parallels between the film and certain superhero comic books, like Powers, Watchmen, Fantastic Four, Justice League, and The Avengers. The producers of the 2005 adaptation of Fantastic Four were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to The Incredibles.[44] Bird was not surprised that comparisons arose due to superheroes being \"the most well-trod turf on the planet,\" but noted that he had not been inspired by any comic books specifically, only having heard of Watchmen. He did comment that it was nice to be compared to it, since \"if you\\'re going to be compared to something, it\\'s nice if it\\'s something good\".[16]\\n Some commentators took Bob\\'s frustration with celebrating mediocrity and Syndrome\\'s comment that \"when everyone\\'s super, no one will be\" as a reflection of views shared by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche or an extension of Russian-American novelist Ayn Rand\\'s Objectivism philosophy, which Bird felt was \"ridiculous.\"[9][16] He stated that a large portion of the audience understood the message as he intended whereas \"two percent thought I was doing The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged.\" Some purported that The Incredibles exhibited a right-wing bias, which Bird also scoffed at. \"I think that\\'s as silly of an analysis as saying The Iron Giant was left-wing. I\\'m definitely a centrist and feel like both parties can be absurd.\"[9]\\n The film also explored Bird\\'s dislike for the tendency of the children\\'s comics and Saturday morning cartoons of his youth to portray villains as unrealistic, ineffectual, and non-threatening.[45] In the film, Dash and Violet have to deal with villains who are perfectly willing to use deadly force against children.[46] On another level, both Dash and Violet display no emotion or regret at the deaths of those who are trying to kill them, such as when Dash outruns pursuers who crash their vehicles while chasing him, or when both of them witness their parents destroy several attacking vehicles with people inside, in such a manner that the deaths of those piloting them is undeniable. Despite disagreeing with some analysis, Bird felt it gratifying for his work to be considered on many different levels, which was his intention: \"The fact that it was written about in the op/ed section of The New York Times several times was really gratifying to me. Look, it\\'s a mainstream animated movie, and how often are those considered thought provoking?\"[9]\\n A teaser trailer of The Incredibles premiered on May 30, 2003, and was attached to the screenings of Finding Nemo.[47] Several companies released promotional products related to the film. In the weeks before the film\\'s opening, there were also promotional tie-ins with SBC Communications (using Dash to promote the \"blazing-fast speed\" of its SBC Yahoo! DSL service) Tide, Downy, Bounce and McDonald\\'s.[48] Dark Horse Comics released a limited series of comic books based on the film.[49] Toy maker Hasbro produced a series of action figures and toys based on the film.[50] Kellogg\\'s released an Incredibles-themed cereal, as well as promotional Pop-Tarts and fruit snacks, all proclaiming an \"Incrediberry Blast\" of flavor.[51] Pringles included potato chips featuring the superheroes and quotes from the film.[52][53] In July 2008, it was announced that a series of comic books based on the film would be published by BOOM! Studios in collaboration with Disney Publishing by the end of the year.[54] The first miniseries by BOOM! was The Incredibles: Family Matters by Mark Waid and Marcio Takara, which was published from March to June 2009[citation needed] and collected into a trade paperback published in July of that year.[55]\\n The Incredibles was released theatrically in the United States on November 5, 2004.[56] In theaters, The Incredibles was accompanied by a short film, Boundin\\' (2003).[57] The theatrical release also included sneak peeks for Cars and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith.[58] While Pixar celebrated another triumph with The Incredibles, Steve Jobs was embroiled in a public feud with the head of its distribution partner, The Walt Disney Company.[59] This would eventually lead to the ousting of Michael Eisner and Disney\\'s acquisition of Pixar the following year. In March 2014, Disney CEO and chairman Bob Iger announced that the film would be reformatted and re-released in 3D.[60] The Incredibles was re-released and digitally re-mastered for IMAX theaters (alongside its sequel, Incredibles 2) using their DMR Technology in a double feature on June 14, 2018.[61]\\n As part of Disney\\'s 100th anniversary The Incredibles was re-released between September 1 to 14, 2023 in the United States[62] and October 5 to 11 in Latin America.[63]\\n The film was first released on both VHS and a two-disc collector\\'s edition DVD set on March 15, 2005.[64][65] The DVD set was THX certified,[66] consisted of widescreen and a pan and scan fullscreen versions and included two newly commissioned Pixar short films, Jack-Jack Attack and Mr. Incredible and Pals, which were made specifically for this home-video release, and Boundin\\', a Pixar short film that premiered alongside the feature film in its original theatrical release.[66][67][68] The VHS release only featured the short, Boundin\\'. It was the highest-selling DVD of 2005, with 17.38\\xa0million copies sold.[69] The film was also released on UMD for the Sony PSP.[70] Disney released the film on Blu-ray in North America on April 12, 2011,[71] and on 4K UHD Blu-ray on June 5, 2018; this marks Disney\\'s first 4K Blu-ray reissue on the format.[72]\\n The Incredibles earned $261.4\\xa0million in the United States and Canada and $370.1\\xa0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $631.6\\xa0million.[3] It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2004, behind Shrek 2, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and Spider-Man 2.[73]\\n The Incredibles was released with Alfie on November 5, 2004. It debuted earning $70.7\\xa0million from 3,933 theaters.[4][74] This made it the second-highest opening weekend for an animated film, trailing only behind Shrek 2. The film opened in the number #1 spot at the box office, dominating Saw, The Grudge, Shark Tale, Ray, Ladder 49 and other films. Despite its opening, the overall Hollywood revenues fell, continuing a box office slump that had lingered for most of the fall season. The top 12 movies took in $136.1 million down to 5% from the same weekend the previous year, just after the openings of The Matrix Revolutions and Elf.[75] For 15 years, The Incredibles had the biggest November opening weekend for an animated film until it was dethroned by Frozen II in 2019.[76] It continued to rule the box office while staying ahead of The Polar Express. Its second weekend earnings dropped by 28% to $51\\xa0million,[77][78] and followed by another $26\\xa0million the third weekend.[79] The Incredibles completed its theatrical run in the United States and Canada on April 14, 2005.[80]\\n On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 97% of 248 critics\\' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"Bringing loads of wit and tons of fun to the animated superhero genre, The Incredibles easily lives up to its name.\"[81] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[82] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale, making it Pixar\\'s fourth (consecutive) film to receive this grade (after Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc., and Finding Nemo).[83]\\n Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half out of four, writing that the film \"alternates breakneck action with satire of suburban sitcom life\" and is \"another example of Pixar\\'s mastery of popular animation.\"[84] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film three-and-a-half, calling it \"one of the year\\'s best\" and saying that it \"doesn\\'t ring cartoonish, it rings true.\"[85] Giving the film three-and-a-half as well, People magazine found that The Incredibles \"boasts a strong, entertaining story and a truckload of savvy comic touches.\"[86]\\n Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution was bored by the film\\'s \"recurring pastiches of earlier action films\", concluding that \"the Pixar whizzes do what they do excellently; you just wish they were doing something else.\"[87] Jessica Winter of The Village Voice criticized the film for \"playing as a standard summer action film\", despite being released in early November. Her review, titled as \"Full Metal Racket,\" noted that The Incredibles \"announces the studio\\'s arrival in the vast yet overcrowded Hollywood lot of eardrum-bashing, metal-crunching action sludge.\"[88] Laura Clifford of Reeling Reviews gave the film an A- and said, \"Mix X-Men with True Lies and Spy Kids then add the retro design of The Powerpuff Girls all tied together with the magical technology of Pixar.\"[89] In a positive review, Jennifer Frey of The Washington Post explained that \"the movie is full of wonderful little touches: Syndrome, the bad guy, is drawn to remind viewers of Heat Miser from the classic Christmas cartoon The Year Without a Santa Claus. As always, Pixar excels with its animation, but what makes this family film even more appealing is the smartness of the script, which is clearly written, end to end, to appeal to adults as well as children.\"[90]\\n The Incredibles was included on a number of best-of lists. It appeared on professional rankings from The Guardian based on retrospective appraisal, as one of the greatest films of the twenty-first century.[91] Travers also named it as number 6 on his list of the decade\\'s best films.[92] Several publications have listed it as one of the best animated films, including: Entertainment Weekly (2009),[93] IGN (2010),[94] Insider, USA Today, Elle (all 2018),[95][96][97] Rolling Stone (2019),[98] Parade, Complex, Time Out New York, and Empire (all 2021).[b] The Incredibles appeared on several lists of the best superhero films, by outlets including: Time (2011),[103] Paste, Vulture, Marie Claire (all 2019),[104][105][106] IGN (2020),[107] Esquire, The Indian Express, and Parade (all 2021).[108][109][110] In December 2021, the film\\'s screenplay was listed number 48 on the Writers Guild of America\\'s \"101 Greatest Screenplays of the 21st Century (So Far)\".[111] Others have named it one of the best conservative films,[112] best action films,[113][114] and best political films.[115]\\n The Incredibles led the 77th Academy Awards season with four nominations (including Best Original Screenplay and Sound Mixing). It received two Oscars: Best Animated Feature and Sound Editing.[116] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal called The Incredibles the year\\'s best picture.[16] Premiere magazine released a cross-section of all the top critics in America and The Incredibles placed at number three, whereas review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes cross-referenced reviews that suggested it was its year\\'s highest-rated film.[16]\\n The film also received the 2004 Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form, and it was nominated for the 2004 Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture\\xa0– Musical or Comedy. It also won the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film. The American Film Institute included it as one of the top 10 films of 2004.[117]\\n It was included on Empire\\'s 500 Greatest Films of All Time at number 400.[118]\\n It has received several game adaptations: The Incredibles (2004), The Incredibles: When Danger Calls (2004),[119] and The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer (2005).[120] Kinect Rush: A Disney–Pixar Adventure (2012) features characters and worlds from five Pixar films, including The Incredibles.[121][122] Disney Infinity (2013) includes The Incredibles playset featuring the film\\'s playable characters.[123] Lego The Incredibles was released in June 2018.[124]\\n A sequel, titled Incredibles 2, was released on June 15, 2018[125] and was once again a critical and commercial success, although it was considered inferior in comparison to its predecessor.[126]', 'Shrek is a 2001 American animated fantasy comedy film loosely based on the 1990 children\\'s picture book by William Steig. Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson (in their feature directorial debuts) and written by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Joe Stillman, and Roger S. H. Schulman, it is the first installment in the Shrek film series. The film stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow. In the film, an embittered ogre named Shrek (Myers) finds his home in the swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures banished by the obsessive ruler Lord Farquaad (Lithgow). With the help of Donkey (Murphy), Shrek makes a pact with Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona (Diaz) in exchange for regaining control of his swamp.\\n After purchasing the rights to Steig\\'s book in 1991, Steven Spielberg sought to produce a traditionally-animated film adaptation, but John H. Williams convinced him to bring the project to the newly founded DreamWorks in 1994. Jeffrey Katzenberg, along with Williams and Aron Warner, began development on Shrek in 1995, immediately following the studio\\'s purchase of the rights from Spielberg. Chris Farley was cast as the voice for the title character, recording most of the required dialogue, but died in 1997 before his work on the film was finished; Myers was hired to replace him, and gave Shrek his Scottish accent. The film was initially intended to be created using motion capture, but after poor test results, the studio hired Pacific Data Images to complete the final computer animation. Shrek parodies other fairy tale adaptations, primarily animated Disney films.[7]\\n Shrek premiered at the Mann Village Theatre In Westwood, and was later shown at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d\\'Or,[4][8] making it the first animated film since Disney\\'s Peter Pan (1953) to be chosen to do so.[9] The film was theatrically released by DreamWorks Pictures in the United States on May 18, 2001, and grossed over $492 million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2001. It was widely praised by critics for its animation, voice performances, soundtrack, writing and humor, which they noted catered to both adults and children. Shrek was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and won the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\\n The film\\'s major success helped establish DreamWorks Animation as a competitor to Pixar in feature film computer animation. Three sequels have been released—Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010)—along with two spin-off films—Puss in Boots (2011) and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)—with other productions, notably Shrek 5, in development. It is also regarded as one of the most influential animated films of the 2000s and one of the greatest animated films ever made.[10][11][12] The United States Library of Congress selected Shrek for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2020, becoming the first animated film of the 21st century to be preserved.\\n Shrek is an anti-social and highly territorial ogre who loves the solitude of his swamp and enjoys fending off mobs and intruders. His life is interrupted after the dwarfish Lord Farquaad of Duloc exiles a vast number of fairy-tale creatures, who inadvertently end up in the swamp. Angered by the intrusion, Shrek decides to visit Farquaad and demand him to move the creatures elsewhere. Shrek reluctantly allows a talkative Donkey, whom he saved from Farquaad\\'s guards before, to tag along and guide him to Duloc.\\n Meanwhile, Farquaad is presented with the Magic Mirror, who tells him that he must marry a princess in order to become king. Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, who is imprisoned in a castle guarded by a Dragon. Unwilling to rescue Fiona himself, he organizes a tournament in which the winner will receive the \"privilege\" of performing the task on his behalf. When Shrek and Donkey arrive at Duloc, Farquaad announces that whoever kills Shrek will win the tournament; however, Shrek and Donkey defeat Farquaad\\'s knights with relative ease. Amused, Farquaad proclaims them champions, and agrees to relocate the fairy-tale creatures if Shrek rescues Fiona.\\n Shrek and Donkey travel to the castle and are attacked by the Dragon. Shrek locates Fiona, who is appalled by his lack of romanticism; they flee the castle after rescuing Donkey from the dragon, who\\'s revealed to be female and has fallen in love with him. When Shrek removes his helmet and reveals he is an ogre, Fiona stubbornly refuses to go to Duloc, demanding Farquaad arrive in person to save her. Shrek carries Fiona against her will. That night, after setting up camp, and with Fiona alone in a cave, Shrek admits to Donkey that he is anti-social because he grew frustrated after being constantly judged for his appearance. Fiona overhears this and decides to be more kind to Shrek. The next day, the three are harassed by Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men, but Fiona easily defeats them in physical combat. Shrek becomes impressed with Fiona, and they begin to fall in love.\\n When the trio nears Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey later enters alone and discovers that Fiona has transformed into an ogre. She explains that during her childhood, she was cursed to transform into an ogre at night but retain her human form during the day. She tells Donkey that only \"true love\\'s kiss\" will break the spell and change her to \"love\\'s true form\". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his feelings to Fiona, when he overhears Fiona referring to herself as an \"ugly beast\". But believing that she is talking about him, Shrek angrily leaves and returns the next morning with Farquaad. Confused and hurt by Shrek\\'s abrupt hostility, Fiona accepts Farquaad\\'s marriage proposal and requests that they be married before nightfall. Shrek abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp, but quickly realizes that he feels miserable without Fiona. Donkey appears, scolding Shrek for his bad behavior and for jumping to conclusions. He even tells Shrek that Fiona was not referring to him as an \"ugly beast\" and encourages him to express his love to Fiona. The two reconcile, and quickly travel to Duloc by riding the Dragon, whom Donkey has befriended.\\n Shrek interrupts the wedding just before the ceremony ends and tells Fiona that Farquaad is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets as Fiona transforms into an ogre in front of everyone, causing Shrek to understand Fiona\\'s previous remarks. Outraged and disgusted, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona re-imprisoned, so that he will still be king by technicality. The two are saved when the Dragon, ridden by Donkey, breaks in and devours Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss. Fiona\\'s curse is broken; she is surprised to find she has remained an ogre, though Shrek reassures her that he still finds her beautiful. They marry in the swamp with the fairy-tale creatures in attendance, then leave for their honeymoon.\\n \\nAt the time DreamWorks Pictures was founded, producer John H. Williams got hold of the book from his children and when he brought it to DreamWorks, it caught CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg\\'s attention and the studio decided to make it into a film.[20] Recounting the inspiration of making the film, Williams said:  Every development deal starts with a pitch and my pitch came from my then kindergartner, in collaboration with his pre-school brother. Upon our second reading of Shrek, the kindergartner started quoting large segments of the book pretending he could read them. Even as an adult, I thought Shrek was outrageous, irreverent, iconoclastic, gross, and just a lot of fun. He was a great movie character in search of a movie.[21] After buying the rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put it in active development in November 1995.[22][23] Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film adaptation of the book before, when he bought the rights to the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey.[24] In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg and had an argument with him about how much the film should appeal to adults. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he deemed some of Adamson\\'s ideas, such as adding sexual jokes and Guns N\\' Roses music to the soundtrack, to be too outrageous.[25][26] Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson, although Asbury would later co-direct the sequel. Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know whom to go to with specific detail questions about the film\\'s sequences; \"We both ended up doing a lot of everything,\" Adamson said. \"We\\'re both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything.\"[27]\\n Some early sketches of Shrek\\'s house were done between 1996 and 1997 using Photoshop, with the sketches showing Shrek first living in a garbage dump near a human village called Wart Creek. It was also thought at one time that he would live with his parents and keep rotting fish in his bedroom.[28] Donkey was modeled after Pericles (born 1994; also known as Perry), a real miniature donkey from Barron Park in Palo Alto, California.[29] Raman Hui, supervising animator of Shrek, stated that Fiona \"wasn\\'t based on any real person\" and he did many different sketches for her. He had done over 100 sculptures of Fiona before the directors chose the final design.[30] In early development, the art directors visited Hearst Castle, Stratford upon Avon, and Dordogne for inspiration. Art Director Douglas Rogers visited a magnolia plantation in Charleston, South Carolina, for inspiration of Shrek\\'s swamp.[31][32] Planned characters not used in the film include Goldilocks and Sleeping Beauty.[33]\\n The screenplay was written by Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Joe Stillman, and Roger S. H. Schulman, loosely based on the picture book by William Steig. The way Steig upended fairy tale conventions in the original book by making an ogre the protagonist formed the basis for the movie being a parody of fairy tales. Elliott and Rossio began writing for the film in 1997 and worked on the project for two years. They centered the four main characters’ personalities on maladaptive responses to self-esteem issues; as the DreamWorks story crew developed the plot, their personalities remained the same, ensuring the “thematic unity” of the story was preserved. When the studio leaned towards Shrek being a kind person shunned for being an ogre, they pushed for Shrek to remain a “misanthropic anti-hero.”[34][35]\\n Nicolas Cage was initially offered the role of Shrek but he turned it down because he did not want to look like an ogre. In 2013, Cage explained: \"When you\\'re drawn, in a way it says more about how children are going to see you than anything else, and I so care about that.\"[36]\\n Chris Farley was initially hired to voice Shrek, and he had recorded nearly all of the dialogue for the character, but died before completing the project.[37] According to David Spade, Farley only had 5 days left of voice work and Farley\\'s brother John was asked if he would come in and finish his lines but John refused.[38] A story reel featuring a sample of Farley\\'s recorded dialogue was leaked to the public in August 2015.[39] DreamWorks then re-cast the voice role to Mike Myers, who insisted on a complete script rewrite, to leave no traces of Farley\\'s version of Shrek.[37] According to Myers, he wanted to voice the character \"for two reasons: I wanted the opportunity to work with Jeffrey Katzenberg; and [the book is] a great story about accepting yourself for who you are.\"[21]\\n After Myers had completed providing the voice for the character over the course of 1999 and the film was well into production, a rough cut of the movie was shown to him in February 2000.[40] Myers asked to re-record all of his lines with a Scottish accent, similar to that his mother used when she told him bedtime stories and also used for his roles in other films, such as So I Married an Axe Murderer and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.[37] According to the DVD commentary, he had also tried using a Lothar of the Hill People accent and a Canadian accent.[41] After hearing the alternative, Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film, saying, \"It was so good we took $4M worth of animation out and did it again.\"[42] Myers disputed the cost, saying \"it didn\\'t cost the studio \\'millions of dollars\\',\" as rumored. \"What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions, I went in for twenty sessions. I got paid the same.\"[43] Because of Myers voicing the character, more ideas began to come. There were clearer story points, fresher gags and comedy bits.[44] \"I got a letter from Spielberg thanking me so much for caring about the character,\" Myers said. \"And he said the Scottish accent had improved the movie.\"[45]\\n Another person planned to voice a character in the film was Janeane Garofalo, who was set to star alongside Farley as Princess Fiona. However, she was fired from the project for unexplained reasons. Years later, Garofalo stated \"I was never told why [I was fired]. I assume because I sound like a man sometimes? I don\\'t know why. Nobody told me\\xa0... But, you know, the movie didn\\'t do anything, so who cares?\"[46]\\n Shrek was originally set up to be a live-action/CG animation hybrid with background plate miniature sets and the main characters composited into the scene as motion-captured computer graphics, using an ExpertVision Hires Falcon 10 camera system to capture and apply realistic human movement to the characters.[47] Softimage was used, as well as Mental Ray.[48] A sizable crew was hired to run a test, and after a year and a half of R & D, the test was finally screened in May 1997.[49] The results were not satisfactory, with Katzenberg stating \"It looked terrible, it didn\\'t work, it wasn\\'t funny, and we didn\\'t like it.\"[37] The animation wasn\\'t released publicly until 2023 when it was posted by production designer Barry E. Jackson on his YouTube channel.[50] The studio then turned to its production partners at Pacific Data Images (PDI), who began production with the studio in 1998[51] and helped Shrek get to its final, computer-animated look.[37] At this time, Antz was still in production at the studio[37] and effects supervisor Ken Bielenberg was asked by Aron Warner \"to start development for Shrek\".[52] Similar to previous PDI films, PDI used its own proprietary software (like the Fluid Animation System) for its animated movies. For some elements, however, it also took advantage of some of the powerhouse animation software on the market. This is particularly true with Maya, which PDI used for most of its dynamic cloth animation and for the hair of Fiona and Farquaad.[53]\\n \"We did a lot of work on character and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation,\" Hui noted. \"In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us a long time to get right.\"[54] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey\\'s fur flow smoothly so that it did not look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators, who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.).[32] It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it could be applied to many aspects of the movie, including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek\\'s tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey\\'s fur, requiring a separate rendering system and much attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.[32]\\n Shrek has 31 sequences, with 1,288 total shots.[31] Aron Warner said that the creators \"envisioned a magical environment that you could immerse yourself into\". Shrek includes 36 separate in-film locations to make the world of the film, which DreamWorks claimed was more than any previous computer-animated feature. In-film locations were finalized and, as demonstrated by past DreamWorks animated movies, color and mood was of the utmost importance.[32] The animation was completed in 2000.[55]\\n Shrek is the third DreamWorks animated film (and the only film in the Shrek series) to have Harry Gregson-Williams team up with John Powell to compose the score following Antz (1998) and Chicken Run (2000).[56] Powell was left out to compose scores for later Shrek films with Gregson-Williams due to a conflict.[57] The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios by Nick Wollage and Slamm Andrews, with the latter mixing it at Media Ventures and Patricia Sullivan-Fourstar handling mastering.[58]\\n Shrek introduced a new element to give the film a unique feel. The film used pop music and other oldies to make the story more forward. Covers of songs like \"On the Road Again\" and \"Try a Little Tenderness\" were integrated in the film\\'s score.[59] The band Smash Mouth\\'s song \"All Star\" gained massive popularity after its original release two years earlier,  due to its usage in the film\\'s opening credits.[60] As the film was about to be completed, Katzenberg suggested to the filmmakers to redo the film\\'s ending to \"go out with a big laugh\"; instead of ending the film with just a storybook closing over Shrek and Fiona as they ride off into the sunset, they decided to add a song \"I\\'m a Believer\" covered by Smash Mouth and show all the fairytale creatures in the film.[61]\\n Although Rufus Wainwright\\'s version of the song \"Hallelujah\" appeared in the soundtrack album, it was John Cale\\'s version that appeared in the film; in a radio interview, Rufus Wainwright suggested that his version of \"Hallelujah\" did not appear in the film due to the \"glass ceiling\" he was hitting because of his sexuality. An alternative explanation is that, although the filmmakers wanted Cale\\'s version for the film, licensing issues prevented its use in the soundtrack album, because Wainwright was an artist for DreamWorks but Cale was not.[62]\\n The film\\'s 1996 animation test used the song \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\". The clip was considered lost until 2023.[63]\\n In many places, the film references classic movies, predominantly those by Disney. When Tinker Bell falls on Donkey and he says \"I can fly\" and people around including the Three Little Pigs say \"He can fly, he can fly\"; this is a reference to Disney\\'s Peter Pan. Donkey then says, while still flying, \"You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, but I bet you ain\\'t never seen a Donkey fly!\". This scene is a reference to the Disney film Dumbo.[64] The scene where Fiona is singing to the blue bird is a reference to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.[64] The transformation scene at the end of the film references Disney\\'s Beauty and the Beast.[64]\\n When Shrek crosses the bridge to the Castle and says, \"That\\'ll do, Donkey, that\\'ll do\", this is a reference to the movie Babe.[64] The scene where Princess Fiona is fighting the Merry Men is a lengthy reference to the film The Matrix.[64] At the end of the film, the Gingerbread Man at the end with a crutch (and one leg) says \"God bless us, everyone\" which is a reference to Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol.[64]\\n In the scene where the Magic Mirror gives Lord Farquaad the option to marry three princesses, it parodies popular American television show The Dating Game featuring: Cinderella and Snow White.[65] In addition, Lord Farquaad\\'s theme park style kingdom Duloc heavily mimics Disneyland, even in so far as parodying the famous \"It\\'s a Small World\" musical ride in the scene with the singing puppets.[65] It has been suggested that Lord Farquaad himself is an unflattering parody of then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, whom producer Katzenberg reportedly dislikes.[66]\\n In 2000, IMAX released CyberWorld onto its branded large-screen theaters. It was a compilation film that featured stereoscopic conversions of various animated shorts and sequences, including the bar sequence in Antz. DreamWorks was so impressed by the technology used for the sequence\\'s \"stereoscopic translation\", that the studio and IMAX decided to plan a big-screen 3D version of Shrek. The film would have been re-released during the Christmas season of 2001, or the following summer, after its conventional 2D release. The re-release would have also included new sequences and an alternate ending. Plans for this was dropped due to \"creative changes\" instituted by DreamWorks and resulted in a loss of $1.18\\xa0million, down from IMAX\\'s profit of $3.24\\xa0million.[67][68][69]\\n Radio Disney was told not to allow any ads for the film to air on the station, stating, \"Due to recent initiatives with The Walt Disney Company, we are being asked not to align ourselves promotionally with this new release Shrek. Stations may accept spot dollars only in individual markets.\"[70] The restriction was later relaxed to allow ads for the film\\'s soundtrack album onto the network.[71]\\n On May 7, 2001, Burger King began promotions for the film, giving out a selection of nine exclusive Candy Caddies based on the Shrek characters, in Big Kids Meal and Kids Meal orders.[72] Ice cream chain Baskin-Robbins also ran an 8-week promotion of the film, selling products such as Shrek\\'s Hot Sludge Sundae, a combination of Oreo Cookies \\'n Cream ice cream, hot fudge, crushed chocolate cookies, whipped cream and squiggly gummy worms, and Shrek Freeze Frame Cake, featuring an image of Shrek and Donkey framed by sunflowers. This was to support the film\\'s DVD/VHS release.[73]\\n Shrek was released by DreamWorks Home Entertainment on VHS and DVD on November 2, 2001.[74][75] It surpassed Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace\\'s short-lived record for being the fastest-selling DVD title of all time, selling 2.5 million copies within the first three days of release.[76] Another 4.5 million copies were sold on VHS in the same timespan, making it the biggest opening weekend in retail video since The Lion King in 1995.[76] Both releases included Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party, a 3-minute musical short film, that takes up right after Shrek\\'s ending, with film\\'s characters performing a medley of modern pop songs.[77] As for the DVD release, this two-disc set features a fullscreen format on the first disc and a widescreen format on the second disc, with the latter featuring a DTS audio track.[78]\\n Coincidentally, the film was released on video the same day that Pixar\\'s Monsters, Inc. hit theaters. Since videos were traditionally released on Tuesdays, Disney\\'s executives did not receive this well, saying that the move \"seemed like an underhanded attempt to siphon off some of their film\\'s steam\". DreamWorks responded that it \"simply shifted the release to a Friday to make it more of an event and predicted that it and other studios would do so more frequently with important films.\" Monsters, Inc. earned that weekend more than $62\\xa0million, breaking the record for an animated film, while Shrek\\'s video release made more than $100\\xa0million,[79] and eventually became the biggest selling DVD at the time with over 5.5\\xa0million sales.[80] This broke the record previously held by Gladiator, another DreamWorks film.[81] Shrek generated more than $420 million in revenue for DreamWorks on DVD and VHS, and has sold more than 21 million copies of the 23 million shipped by January 2002.[74] Worldwide, more than 10 million Shrek DVDs have been sold by that point.[74]\\n A 3D version of the film was released on Blu-ray 3D by Paramount Home Entertainment on December 1, 2010, along with its sequels,[82] and a regular 2D Blu-ray boxset of the series was released six days later.[83]\\n In commemoration of the film\\'s 20th anniversary, an Ultra HD Blu-ray edition was released on May 11, 2021, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.[84]\\n Shrek opened on around 6,000 screens[85] across 3,587 theaters;[86] eleven of them showed the film digitally.[87] This was the first time that DreamWorks had shown one of its films digitally.[88] The film earned $11.6\\xa0million on its first day and $42.3\\xa0million on its opening weekend, topping the box office for the weekend and averaging $11,805 from 3,587 theaters.[89] In its second weekend, due to the Memorial Day Weekend holiday, the film gained 0.3\\xa0percent to $42.5\\xa0million and $55.2\\xa0million over the four-day weekend, resulting in an overall 30\\xa0percent gain.[90] Despite this, the film finished in second place behind Pearl Harbor and had an average of $15,240 from expanding to 3,623 sites.[90] In its third weekend, the film retreated 34\\xa0percent to $28.2\\xa0million for a $7,695 average from expanding to 3,661 theaters.[91] By mid-June 2001, Shrek became the top-grossing movie of the year domestically, defeating The Mummy Returns.[92] This achievement would last until that December when it was beaten by Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone.[93] The film closed on December 6, 2001, after grossing $267.7\\xa0million domestically, along with $216.7\\xa0million overseas, for a worldwide total of $484.4\\xa0million.[5] Produced on a $60\\xa0million budget, the film was a huge box office smash[5] and is the fourth highest-grossing film of 2001.[94]\\n Shrek became the highest-grossing animated film ever to be released in Australia, passing the mark set by The Lion King in 1994.[95] In the United Kingdom, Shrek regained the top spot at the British box office after being beaten out the previous week by Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, earning a $20.3\\xa0million since its opening in the UK.[96]\\n In addition to being an instant box office success, Shrek received wide critical acclaim.[97][98][99] 88% of 213 professional reviews of the film on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes are positive, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales, the irreverent Shrek also manages to tweak Disney\\'s nose, provide a moral message to children, and offer viewers a funny, fast-paced ride.\"[100] Metacritic assigned Shrek a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[101] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[102]\\n Roger Ebert praised the film, giving it four stars out of a possible four and describing it as \"jolly and wicked, filled with sly in-jokes and yet somehow possessing a heart\".[103] USA Today\\'s Susan Wloszczyna praised Eddie Murphy\\'s performance, stating it \"gives the comic performance of his career, aided by sensational digital artistry, as he brays for the slightly neurotic motormouth\".[104] Richard Schickel of Time also enjoyed Murphy\\'s role, stating \"No one has ever made a funnier jackass of himself than Murphy.\"[105] Peter Rainer of New York magazine liked the script, also stating \"The animation, directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is often on the same wriggly, giggly level as the script, although the more \"human\" characters, such as Princess Fiona and Lord Farquaad, are less interesting than the animals and creatures—a common pitfall in animated films of all types.\"[106] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote \"Shrek is a world-class charmer that could even seduce the academy when it hands out the first official animation Oscar next year.\"[107] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"Shrek is not a guilty pleasure for sophisticated movie-goers; it is, purely and simply, a pleasure.\"[108] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote \"The witty, fractured fairy tale Shrek has a solid base of clever writing.\"[109] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A−, saying \"A kind of palace coup, a shout of defiance, and a coming of age for DreamWorks.\"[110] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel wrote \"It\\'s a pleasure to be able to report that the movie both captures and expands upon the book\\'s playful spirit of deconstruction.\"[111]\\n Steven Rosen of The Denver Post wrote \"DreamWorks Pictures again proves a name to trust for imaginative, funny animated movies that delight kids and adults equally.\"[112] Susan Stark of The Detroit News gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design.\"[113] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication.\"[114] Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it \"a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass\".[115] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it\\'s just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of Shrek.\"[116] William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating \"We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, \\'What has Hollywood done to it?\\' But we loved it. We were afraid it would be too sickeningly cute and, instead, Bill just thought they did a wonderful, witty job of it.\"[117]\\n John Anderson of Newsday wrote \"The kind of movie that will entertain everyone of every age and probably for ages to come.\"[118] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote \"In an era when much on film seems old, Shrek seems new and fresh and clever.\"[119] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film five out of five stars, saying \"Despite all its high-tech weirdness, it is really that most perdurable of human constructions, a tale told well and true.\"[120] Joe Baltake of The Sacramento Bee wrote that it \"isn\\'t so much a fractured spoof of everything Disney, but actually a Monty Python flick for kids – kids of all ages\".[119] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote \"What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers whose voices remind us of their stellar screen personae in live-action movies.\"[121] Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader wrote \"This romantic fantasy complicates the roles of beauty and beast, making it hard to guess what form a sensitive resolution will take.\"[122] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote \"The charms of Shrek, which is based on the children\\'s book by William Steig, go far beyond in-jokes for adults.\"[123] John Zebrowski of The Seattle Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"The movie is helped immensely by its cast, who carry it through some of the early, sluggish scenes. But this is Murphy\\'s movie. Donkey gets most of the good lines, and Murphy hits every one.\"[124]\\n A mixed review came from Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune, who gave the film two and a half stars out of four and compared it to Toy Story 2, which he said \"had a higher in-jokes/laughs ratio without straining to demonstrate its hipness or to evoke heartfelt emotions\".[125] On the more negative side, Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice said he was \"desperately avoiding the risk of even a half-second of boredom\", and said \"the movie is wall-to-window-to-door noise, babbling, and jokes (the first minute sees the first fart gag), and demographically it\\'s a hard-sell shotgun spray.\"[126] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described Shrek as a \"90-minute onslaught of in-jokes\", and said while it \"strives to have a heart\" with \"a message about beauty coming from within\", \"somehow [the message] rings hollow\".[119] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said, despite the film \"cunning the rendering of surfaces, there\\'s still something flat and charmless in the digital look, and most of the pleasure rises not from the main romance but from the quick, incidental gags.\"[127]\\n Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"Prince Charming? So last millennium. This decade, fairy-tale fans – and Princess Fiona – fell for a fat and flatulent Ogre. Now, that\\'s progress.\"[141]  In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"Ten top Ten\"; the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community Shrek was acknowledged as the eighth best film in the animated genre, and the only non-Disney·Pixar film in the Top 10.[142][10] Shrek was also ranked second in a Channel 4 poll of the \"100 Greatest Family Films\", losing out on the top spot to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.[143] In 2005, Shrek came sixth in Channel 4\\'s 100 Greatest Cartoons poll behind The Simpsons, Tom and Jerry, South Park, Toy Story and Family Guy.[144] In November 2009, the character, Lord Farquaad, was listed No. 14 in IGN UK\\'s \"Top 15 Fantasy Villains\".[145] In 2006, it was ranked third on Bravo\\'s 100 funniest films list.[146] The film\\'s title character was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010.[147]\\n American Film Institute recognition:\\n The New York Times retrospectively described the film as \"a beloved, offbeat fairy tale whose characters and jokes continue to permeate pop culture, reaching another generation of fans.\"[97] Previous films and TV shows, such as Fractured Fairy Tales and The Princess Bride, have parodied the traditional fairy tale.[148][149] Shrek had a significant impact that influenced a later generation of mainstream animated films,[149] receiving recognition for being one of the most influential from the 2000s.[148][150] Particularly after Shrek 2, animated films began to incorporate more pop culture references and end-film musical numbers.[149] Such elements can be seen in films like Robots, Chicken Little, Doogal, Ron\\'s Gone Wrong and more recently with Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken and The Tiger’s Apprentice.[149] It also inspired a number of computer animated films which also spoofed fairy tales, or other related story genres, often including adult-oriented humor, most of which were not nearly as successful as Shrek, such as Chicken Little, Happily N\\'Ever After, Igor, Hoodwinked!, Enchanted and its sequel Disenchanted.[149] In 2020, the United States Library of Congress selected Shrek to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[151]\\n Several video game adaptations of the film have been published on various game console platforms, including Shrek (2001), Shrek: Hassle at the Castle (2002), Shrek: Extra Large (2002), Shrek: Super Party (2002) and Shrek SuperSlam (2005).[152] Shrek was also included as a bonus unlockable character in the video game Tony Hawk\\'s Underground 2 (2004).[153]\\n In 2003, Dark Horse Comics released a three-issue mini-series comic book adaptation of Shrek which was written by Mark Evanier, and the issues were later compiled into a trade paperback.[154]\\n A musical version, based on the film, with music by Jeanine Tesori and a book and lyrics by David Lindsay-Abaire, opened on Broadway on December 14, 2008, and closed January 3, 2010, running for a total of 441 performances.[155] It starred Brian d\\'Arcy James in the title role, Sutton Foster as Princess Fiona, Christopher Sieber as Lord Farquaad, Daniel Breaker as Donkey, and John Tartaglia as Pinocchio.[155] The Broadway production was recorded and released on DVD, Blu-ray and digital media.[156][157][158] A North American Tour opened July 25, 2010, in Chicago.[155] A London production opened in the West End on June 7, 2011.[159] The musical received many Tony Award nominations and won the 2009 Tony Award for Best Costume Design. It received five Laurence Olivier Award nominations including Best New Musical.[160]\\n A shot-for-shot fan remake titled Shrek Retold was released through 3GI Industries on November 29, 2018. The project was a collaboration of 200 filmmakers and mixes live action, hand drawn animation, Flash animation, CGI and various other art forms to recreate the film. The film is available on YouTube for free.[161][162]\\n Three sequels were released over the years – the Oscar-nominated Shrek 2 in 2004, Shrek the Third in 2007, and Shrek Forever After in 2010. Shrek 2 was the only one to receive similar acclaim from critics,[163][164][165] though all three sequels were commercially successful.[166][167] Shrek the Halls (2007) and Scared Shrekless (2010) were released as holiday-themed short films. A spin-off prequel film entitled Puss in Boots, centered on the titular character\\'s life before his debut in Shrek 2, was released in 2011, while a sequel, titled Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and set after the events of Shrek Forever After, was released in 2022.[168] A fifth feature film was originally planned during the development of Shrek Forever After, but the idea was later abandoned by DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg.[169][168] Leading up to NBCUniversal\\'s planned acquisition of DreamWorks Animation in 2016, it was announced that a fifth Shrek film would be released in 2019.[170] On November 6, 2018, Variety reported that Chris Meledandri had been tasked to reboot both Shrek and Puss in Boots, with the original cast potentially returning to reprise their roles.[171][172] While cast members reported that a script was completed for a fifth Shrek film, development stalled and future plans have yet to be officially announced.[173][174] After it was reported in April 2023 that a fifth Shrek film with the original cast and a spinoff featuring Donkey was planned, Murphy said in June 2024 that he had begun voice recording sessions for Shrek 5 months ago and would begin working for the Donkey spinoff once it was finished.[175]', 'A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people over cargo.[1][2] There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. The car is considered an important part of the developed economy.[citation needed]\\n The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, both American cars, are widely considered the first mass-produced[3][4] and mass-affordable[5][6][7] cars, respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[8] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[9] In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialised countries.[10][11]\\n Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than petrol-driven cars before 2025.[12][13] The transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios,[14] such as Project Drawdown\\'s 100 actionable solutions for climate change.[15]\\n There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance.[16] The costs to society include maintaining roads, land-use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[17] Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience.[18] Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and the generation of revenue from taxation. People\\'s ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[19]\\n The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum \"wheeled vehicle\" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre \"two-wheeled cart\", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros \"chariot\".[20][21] It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.[22][23]\\n \"Motor car\", attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British English.[2] \"Autocar\", a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning \"self-propelled car\", is now considered archaic.[24] \"Horseless carriage\" is attested from 1895.[25]\\n \"Automobile\", a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek autós (αὐτός) \"self\" and Latin mobilis \"movable\", entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897.[26] It fell out of favour in Britain and is now used chiefly in North America,[27] where the abbreviated form \"auto\" commonly appears as an adjective in compound formations like \"auto industry\" and \"auto mechanic\".[28][29]\\n In 1649, Hans Hautsch of Nuremberg built a clockwork-driven carriage.[32][33] The first steam-powered vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-centimetre-long (26\\xa0in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.[18][34][35] It is not known with certainty if Verbiest\\'s model was successfully built or run.[35]\\n Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.[36] He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.[36] His inventions were limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.[36] In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.\\n The development of external combustion (steam) engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. In the United Kingdom, sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.\\n In 1807, Nicéphore Niépce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world\\'s first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyréolophore), but installed it in a boat on the river Saone in France.[37] Coincidentally, in 1807, the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed his own \"de Rivaz internal combustion engine\", and used it to develop the world\\'s first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Niépces\\' Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.[37] Neither design was successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir,[38] who each built vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.[39]\\n In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouvé demonstrated a three-wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity.[40] Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were working on cars at about the same time, the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—when the German Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen; he is generally acknowledged as the inventor of the car.[39][41][42]\\n In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888, Bertha Benz, the wife and business partner of Carl Benz, undertook the first road trip by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband\\'s invention.[43]\\n In 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called boxermotor. During the last years of the 19th century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a joint-stock company. The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world, was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897, the Präsident automobil.\\n Daimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name Daimler. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895, about 30\\xa0vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach, and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other\\'s early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35\\xa0hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\\n In 1890, Émile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France. In 1891, Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a petrol-driven vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2,100 kilometres (1,300\\xa0mi) from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first Paris–Brest–Paris bicycle race, but finished six days after the winning cyclist, Charles Terront.\\n The first design for an American car with a petrol internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester, New York. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of 16 years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, Selden was granted a US patent (U.S. patent 549,160) for a two-stroke car engine, which hindered, more than encouraged, development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others, and overturned in 1911.\\n In 1893, the first running, petrol-driven American car was built and road-tested by the Duryea brothers of Springfield, Massachusetts. The first public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon took place on 21 September 1893, on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield.[44][45] Studebaker, subsidiary of a long-established wagon and coach manufacturer, started to build cars in 1897[46]:\\u200a66\\u200a and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 and petrol vehicles in 1904.[47]\\n In Britain, there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success, with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860.[48] Santler from Malvern is recognised by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first petrol-driven car in the country in 1894,[49] followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895, but these were both one-offs.[49] The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Company, a company founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896, after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines. Lawson\\'s company made its first car in 1897, and they bore the name Daimler.[49]\\n In 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a \"New Rational Combustion Engine\". In 1897, he built the first diesel engine.[39] Steam-, electric-, and petrol-driven vehicles competed for a few decades, with petrol internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only Mazda\\'s version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success.\\n All in all, it is estimated that over 100,000\\xa0patents created the modern automobile and motorcycle.[50]\\n Large-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan, and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the US by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts.[51] This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world\\'s first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.\\n As a result, Ford\\'s cars came off the line in 15-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower (from 12.5\\xa0manhours to 1\\xa0hour 33\\xa0minutes).[52] It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colours available before 1913, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford\\'s apocryphal remark, \"any color as long as it\\'s black\".[52] In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months\\' pay.[52]\\n Ford\\'s complex safety procedures—especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about—dramatically reduced the rate of injury.[53] The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \"Fordism\" and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the US. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\\n In the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citroën was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.[52]\\n Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world\\'s attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910–1911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.\\n Since the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \"move up\" as their fortunes improved.\\n Reflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared bonnet, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.[52]\\n In Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford\\'s practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss\\' British subsidiary (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41\\xa0per cent of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra, had gone under. Citroën did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault\\'s 10CV and Peugeot\\'s 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete.[52] Germany\\'s first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at Rüsselsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5\\xa0per cent of the market.[52]\\n In Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companies were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three-wheeled for commercial uses, like Daihatsu, or were the result of partnering with European companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda\\'s decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries, as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation.\\n The transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution, noise pollution and climate change.[55]\\n Most cars in use in the early 2020s run on petrol burnt in an internal combustion engine (ICE). The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers says that, in countries that mandate low sulphur motor spirit, petrol-fuelled cars built to late 2010s standards (such as Euro-6) emit very little local air pollution.[56][57] Some cities ban older petrol-driven cars and some countries plan to ban sales in future. However, some environmental groups say this phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles must be brought forwards to limit climate change. Production of petrol-fuelled cars peaked in 2017.[58][59]\\n Other hydrocarbon fossil fuels also burnt by deflagration (rather than detonation) in ICE cars include diesel, autogas, and CNG. Removal of fossil fuel subsidies,[60][61] concerns about oil dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. This includes hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Out of all cars sold in 2021, nine per cent were electric, and by the end of that year there were more than 16\\xa0million electric cars on the world\\'s roads.[62] Despite rapid growth, less than two per cent of cars on the world\\'s roads were fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars by the end of 2021.[62] Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use.\\n Oil consumption has increased rapidly in the 20th and 21st centuries because there are more cars; the 1980s oil glut even fuelled the sales of low-economy vehicles in OECD countries. The BRIC countries are adding to this consumption.\\n As of 2023[update] few production cars use wheel hub motors.[63][64]\\n In almost all hybrid (even mild hybrid) and pure electric cars regenerative braking recovers and returns to a battery some energy which would otherwise be wasted by friction brakes getting hot.[65] Although all cars must have friction brakes (front disc brakes and either disc or drum rear brakes[66]) for emergency stops, regenerative braking improves efficiency, particularly in city driving.[67]\\n Cars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort, and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 21st-century cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car\\'s speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation, and other functions. Modern cars\\' controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example, the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.\\n Some of the original controls are no longer required. For example, all cars once had controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However, new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. These include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knobs and switches by secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW\\'s iDrive and Ford\\'s MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars\\' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the early 2020s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.\\n Cars are typically equipped with interior lighting which can be toggled manually or be set to light up automatically with doors open, an entertainment system which originated from car radios, sideways windows which can be lowered or raised electrically (manually on earlier cars), and one or multiple auxiliary power outlets for supplying portable appliances such as mobile phones, portable fridges, power inverters, and electrical air pumps from the on-board electrical system.[68][69][a] More costly upper-class and luxury cars are equipped with features earlier such as massage seats and collision avoidance systems.[70][71]\\n Dedicated automotive fuses and circuit breakers prevent damage from electrical overload.\\n Cars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a boot light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.\\n During the late 20th and early 21st century, cars increased in weight due to batteries,[73] modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and \"more-powerful—if more efficient—engines\"[74] and, as of 2019[update], typically weigh between 1 and 3 tonnes (1.1 and 3.3 short tons; 0.98 and 2.95 long tons).[75] Heavier cars are safer for the driver from a crash perspective, but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users.[74] The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance, with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance. The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, a typical city car, weighs about 700 kilograms (1,500\\xa0lb). Heavier cars include SUVs and extended-length SUVs like the Suburban. Cars have also become wider.[76]\\n Some places tax heavier cars more:[77] as well as improving pedestrian safety this can encourage manufacturers to use materials such as recycled aluminium instead of steel.[78] It has been suggested that one benefit of subsidising charging infrastructure is that cars can use lighter batteries.[79]\\n Most cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats. Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. Utility vehicles like pickup trucks, combine seating with extra cargo or utility functionality. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, coupe, and minivan.\\n Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.[17] Mary Ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown, Ireland,[80] and Henry Bliss one of the US\\'s first pedestrian car casualties in 1899 in New York City.[81] There are now standard tests for safety in new cars, such as the Euro and US NCAP tests,[82] and insurance-industry-backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).[83] However, not all such tests consider the safety of people outside the car, such as drivers of other cars, pedestrians and cyclists.[84]\\n The costs of car usage, which may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance,[16] are weighed against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of the benefits—perceived and real—of vehicle usage. The benefits may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience,[18] and emergency power.[86] During the 1920s, cars had another benefit: \"[c]ouples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates, plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night.\"[87]\\n Similarly the costs to society of car use may include; maintaining roads, land use, air pollution, noise pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life; and can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. Societal benefits may include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of car production and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability of humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.[19]\\n Cars are a major cause of urban air pollution,[90] with all types of cars producing dust from brakes, tyres, and road wear,[91] although these may be limited by vehicle emission standards.[92] While there are different ways to power cars, most rely on petrol or diesel, and they consume almost a quarter of world oil production as of 2019[update].[58] Both petrol and diesel cars pollute more than electric cars.[93] Cars and vans caused 8% of direct carbon dioxide emissions in 2021.[94] As of 2021[update], due to greenhouse gases emitted during battery production, electric cars must be driven tens of thousands of kilometres before their lifecycle carbon emissions are less than fossil fuel cars;[95][96] however this varies considerably[97] and is expected to improve in future due to lower carbon electricity, and longer lasting batteries[98] produced in larger factories.[99] Many governments use fiscal policies, such as road tax, to discourage the purchase and use of more polluting cars;[100] and many cities are doing the same with low-emission zones.[101] Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g., hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels.[citation needed] High fuel taxes or cultural change may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars,[citation needed] or to not drive.[101]\\n The lifetime of a car built in the 2020s is expected to be about 16\\xa0years, or about 2 millionkm (1.2 millionmiles) if driven a lot.[102] According to the International Energy Agency the average rated fuel consumption of new light-duty vehicles fell by only 0.9% between 2017 and 2019, far smaller than the 1.8% annual average reduction between 2010 and 2015. Given slow progress to date, the IEA estimates fuel consumption will have to decrease by 4.3% per year on average from 2019 to 2030.[103] The increase in sales of SUVs is bad for fuel economy.[58] Many cities in Europe have banned older fossil fuel cars and all fossil fuel vehicles will be banned in Amsterdam from 2030.[104] Many Chinese cities limit licensing of fossil fuel cars,[105] and many countries plan to stop selling them between 2025 and 2050.[106]\\n The manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive, and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories, including energy usage, waste and water consumption.[107] Manufacturing each kWh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of petrol.[108] The growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl, therefore encouraging more travel by car, resulting in inactivity and obesity, which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases.[109]\\n Animals and plants are often negatively affected by cars via habitat destruction and pollution. Over the lifetime of the average car, the \"loss of habitat potential\" may be over 50,000 square metres (540,000\\xa0sq\\xa0ft) based on primary production correlations.[110][clarification needed] Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars, referred to as roadkill. More recent road developments are including significant environmental mitigation in their designs, such as green bridges (designed to allow wildlife crossings) and creating wildlife corridors.\\n Growth in the popularity of cars and commuting has led to traffic congestion.[111] Moscow, Istanbul, Bogotá, Mexico City and São Paulo were the world\\'s most congested cities in 2018 according to INRIX, a data analytics company.[112]\\n Mass production of personal motor vehicles in the United States and other developed countries with extensive territories such as Australia, Argentina, and France vastly increased individual and group mobility and greatly increased and expanded economic development in urban, suburban, exurban and rural areas.[citation needed]\\n In the United States, the transport divide and car dependency resulting from domination of car-based transport systems presents barriers to employment in low-income neighbourhoods,[113] with many low-income individuals and families forced to run cars they cannot afford in order to maintain their income.[114] Dependency on automobiles by African Americans may result in exposure to the hazards of driving while black and other types of racial discrimination related to buying, financing and insuring them.[115]\\n Although intensive development of conventional battery electric vehicles is continuing into the 2020s,[116] other car propulsion technologies that are under development include wireless charging,[117] hydrogen cars,[118][119] and hydrogen/electric hybrids.[120] Research into alternative forms of power includes using ammonia instead of hydrogen in fuel cells.[121]\\n New materials which may replace steel car bodies include aluminium,[122] fiberglass, carbon fiber, biocomposites, and carbon nanotubes.[123] Telematics technology is allowing more and more people to share cars, on a pay-as-you-go basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems.[124] Open-source cars are not widespread.[125]\\n Fully autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, already exist as robotaxis[126][127] but have a long way to go before they are in general use.[128]\\n Car-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular, in the US and Europe.[129] For example, in the US, some car-sharing services have experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and 2007. Services like car sharing offer residents to \"share\" a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighbourhoods.[130]\\n The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells the world\\'s motor vehicles, more than three-quarters of which are cars. In 2020, there were 56\\xa0million cars manufactured worldwide,[131] down from 67\\xa0million the previous year.[132]\\n The automotive industry in China produces by far the most (20\\xa0million in 2020), followed by Japan (seven million), then Germany, South Korea and India.[133] The largest market is China, followed by the US.\\n Around the world, there are about a billion cars on the road;[134] they burn over a\\xa0trillion litres (0.26×10^12\\xa0US\\xa0gal; 0.22×10^12\\xa0imp\\xa0gal) of petrol and diesel fuel yearly, consuming about 50 exajoules (14,000\\xa0TWh) of energy.[135] The numbers of cars are increasing rapidly in China and India.[136] In the opinion of some, urban transport systems based around the car have proved unsustainable, consuming excessive energy, affecting the health of populations, and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investment. Many of these negative effects fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars.[137][138] The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems. The car industry is also facing increasing competition from the public transport sector, as some people re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.\\n Established alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transport such as busses, trolleybusses, trains, subways, tramways, light rail, cycling, and walking. Bicycle sharing systems have been established in China and many European cities, including Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programmes have been developed in large US cities.[139][140] Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted.[141] A study which checked the costs and the benefits of introducing Low Traffic Neighbourhood in London found the benefits overpass the costs approximately by 100 times in the first 20 years and the difference is growing over time.[142]\\n General:\\n \\n Effects:\\n \\n Mitigation:', 'Ratatouille (/ˌrætəˈtuːi/ RAT-ə-TOO-ee, French: [ʁatatuj] ⓘ; Occitan: ratatolha [ʀataˈtuʎɔ] ⓘ) is a French Provençal dish of stewed vegetables that originated in Nice and is sometimes referred to as ratatouille niçoise (French: [niswaz]).[1] Recipes and cooking times differ widely, but common ingredients include tomato, garlic, onion, courgette (zucchini), aubergine (eggplant, brinjal), capsicum (bell pepper), and some combination of leafy green herbs common to the region, such as chives or fennel.\\n The word ratatouille derives from the Occitan ratatolha[2] and is related to the French ratouiller and tatouiller, expressive forms of the verb touiller, meaning \"to stir up\".[3][4] From the late 18th century, in French, it merely indicated a coarse stew. Modern ratatouille uses tomatoes as a foundation for sautéed garlic, onion, zucchini (courgette), aubergine (eggplant), bell pepper, marjoram, fennel and basil. Instead of basil, bay leaf and thyme, or a mix of green herbs like herbes de Provence can be used. The modern version does not appear in print until c.1930.[5]\\n The Guardian\\'s food and drink writer Felicity Cloake wrote in 2016 that, considering ratatouille\\'s relatively recent origins (it first appeared in 1877[unreliable source]), there exists a great variety of methods of preparation for it.[6] The Larousse Gastronomique claims \"according to the purists, the different vegetables should be cooked separately, then combined and cooked slowly together until they attain a smooth, creamy consistency\", so that (according to the chair of the Larousse\\'s committee, Joël Robuchon) \"each [vegetable] will taste truly of itself.\"[7]\\n Similar dishes exist in many cuisines. These include: piperade (South-West of France), bohémienne (Vaucluse), chichoumeille (Languedoc), tian (South east of France), Confit byaldi (created by Michel Guérard), pisto (Castilian-Manchego, Spain), samfaina (Catalan, Spain), tombet (Majorcan), ciambotta, caponata and peperonata (Italy), briám and tourloú (Greek), şakşuka and türlü (Turkish), ajapsandali (Georgian), lecsó (Hungarian), pinakbet (Filipino), ghiveci (Romanian) and zaalouk (Moroccan). Different parts of the Indian subcontinent have their own versions of winter vegetable stew. Gujarat makes undhiyu, Kerala avial (with coconut and local spices), and Bengal shukto.\\n In 2007, Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios released the film Ratatouille. The film features Remy, a young rat with an exceptional sense of taste and smell who dreams of becoming a chef. The climax of the film sees Remy prepare the titular dish in the form of confit byaldi for the notoriously harsh food critic Anton Ego, who unexpectedly loves the dish due to nostalgia for his mother\\'s cooking of traditional ratatouille. The movie gave widespread exposure to this dish around the world.[8]', 'Monsters, Inc. (also known as Monsters, Incorporated) is a 2001 American animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.[2] Featuring the voices of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, Mary Gibbs, and Jennifer Tilly, the film was directed by Pete Docter (in his feature directorial debut), co-directed by Lee Unkrich and David Silverman, and produced by Darla K. Anderson, from a screenplay by Andrew Stanton and Daniel Gerson. The film centers on two monsters, the hairy James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan (Goodman) and his one-eyed partner and best friend\\xa0Mike Wazowski\\xa0(Crystal), who are employed at the titular energy-producing factory\\xa0Monsters, Inc., which generates power by scaring human children. However, the monster world believes that the children are toxic, and when a little human girl, Boo (Gibbs), sneaks into the factory, she must be returned home before it is too late.\\n Docter began developing the film in 1996, and wrote the story with Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon and Ralph Eggleston, following the idea conceived in a lunch in 1994 attended during the near completion of Toy Story (1995). Stanton wrote the screenplay with Gerson. The characters went through many incarnations over the film\\'s five-year production process. The technical team and animators found new ways to simulate fur and cloth realistically for the film. Randy Newman, who composed the music for Pixar\\'s three prior films, returned to compose the score for its fourth.\\n Monsters, Inc. premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on October 28, 2001, and was released in theaters in the United States on November 2. Upon its release, it received critical acclaim and was a commercial success,[3] grossing over $528\\xa0million worldwide to become the third highest-grossing film of 2001.[1] The film won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"If I Didn\\'t Have You\" and was nominated for the first Best Animated Feature, but lost to DreamWorks\\' Shrek, and was also nominated for Best Original Score and Best Sound Editing. Monsters, Inc. saw a 3D re-release in theaters on December 19, 2012. A prequel titled Monsters University, which was directed by Dan Scanlon, was released on June 21, 2013. A sequel series titled Monsters at Work premiered on Disney+ on July 7, 2021.\\n In a world inhabited by monsters, the city of Monstropolis harnesses the screams of human children for energy. At the Monsters, Incorporated factory, skilled monsters employed as \"scarers\" venture into the human world to scare children and harvest their screams through doors that activate portals to children\\'s bedroom closets. The work is considered dangerous, as human children are believed to be toxic and capable of killing a monster through physical contact. Monsters, Inc. CEO, Henry J. Waternoose III, is concerned about the declining energy production, as children are becoming less easily scared.\\n One evening after work, top scarer James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan discovers that an active door has been left in the station of his rival, Randall Boggs. He inspects the door and accidentally lets a toddler girl into the factory. Frightened, Sulley unsuccessfully tries returning the girl, who escapes into Monstropolis, interrupting Sulley\\'s best friend and assistant Mike Wazowski on a date at a sushi restaurant. Chaos erupts when other monsters see the girl; Sulley and Mike escape with her as the Child Detection Agency (CDA) arrives and quarantines the restaurant. Forced to keep the girl hidden in their apartment for the night, Sulley realizes that she is not toxic and her laughter can generate more energy than screams.\\n The next day, Sulley and Mike disguise the girl as a monster and attempt to send her home. While Mike seeks out her door, Sulley grows attached to her and nicknames her \"Boo\". Randall, waiting in ambush for the girl, kidnaps Mike by accident and reveals his plan to kidnap children and extract screams from them using his invention, the Scream Extractor. Sulley rescues Mike, and they search for Waternoose to alert him of Randall\\'s plan. However, Boo inadvertently reveals herself to Waternoose, who reveals that he is working with Randall. Waternoose banishes Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas in the human world, and abducts Boo.\\n Sulley finds a way to return to the monster world, but Mike refuses to go with him. Sulley returns to the factory and rescues Boo from the Scream Extractor, but Randall fights him. Mike returns to reconcile with Sulley, and both search for Boo\\'s door. Randall eventually catches up to the trio, and Boo easily defeats him after a chase through the factory door vault. Sulley and Mike banish Randall through a door to the human world and destroy it.\\n Mike and Sulley locate Boo\\'s door, but Waternoose brings it down to the scare floor, intending to have the CDA arrest Mike and Sulley. Mike distracts the CDA while Sulley and Boo lure Waternoose into a scare simulation room. There, Sulley tricks Waternoose into revealing his conspiracy with Randall to kidnap thousands of children. Mike records the conversation, exposing Waternoose to the CDA, and Waternoose is arrested. Undercover CDA agent Roz allows Sulley to send Boo home, but has her door destroyed. Sulley retools the company\\'s power generation method to harvest children\\'s laughter instead of screams, as laughter is ten times more powerful. With the energy crisis solved, the factory is now focused on making children laugh to collect energy; Mike becomes the company\\'s top comedian and Sulley becomes the new CEO. Mike then reveals to Sulley he has rebuilt Boo\\'s door. Sulley enters the door and reunites with Boo.\\n The idea for Monsters, Inc., along with ideas that would eventually become A Bug\\'s Life, Finding Nemo, and WALL-E, was conceived in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, and Joe Ranft near the completion of Toy Story.[11] One of the ideas that came out of the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. \"When we were making Toy Story\", Docter said, \"everybody came up to me and said, \\'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.\\' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, \\'Hey, let\\'s do a film about monsters.\\'\"[12]\\n Docter began work on the film that was to become Monsters, Inc. in 1996 while others focused on A Bug\\'s Life (1998) and Toy Story 2 (1999). Its code name was Hidden City, after Docter\\'s favorite restaurant in Point Richmond.[13] By early February 1997, Docter, together with Harley Jessup, Jill Culton, and Jeff Pidgeon, had drafted a treatment that bore some resemblance to the final film. Docter pitched the story to Disney with some initial artwork on February 4 that year. He and his story team left with some suggestions in hand and returned to pitch a refined version of the story on May 30. At this pitch meeting, longtime Disney animator Joe Grant\\xa0– whose work stretched back to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)\\xa0– suggested the title Monsters, Inc., a play on the title of a gangster film Murder, Inc.,[14] and the name stuck.[15] The film would be the first Pixar feature not directed by Lasseter, helmed instead by Docter, as well as Lee Unkrich and David Silverman, who served as co-directors.[16] The early test of Monsters, Inc. was released on October 11, 1998.\\n The storyline took on many forms during production.[17] Docter\\'s original idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he drew in a book as a child coming back to bother him as an adult. Each monster represented a fear he had, and conquering those fears eventually caused the monsters to disappear.[18]\\n After Docter scrapped the initial concept of a 30-year-old terrified of monsters, he decided on a buddy story between a monster and a child titled simply Monsters, in which the monster character of Sulley (known at this stage as Johnson) was an up-and-comer at his workplace, where the company\\'s purpose was to scare children. Sulley\\'s eventual sidekick, Mike Wazowski, had not yet been added.[17][19]\\n Between 1996 and 2000, the lead monster and child went through radical changes as the story evolved. As the story continued to develop, the child varied in age and gender. Ultimately, the story team decided that a girl would be the best counterpart for a furry, 8-foot-tall (2.4\\xa0m) co-star.[17] After a girl was settled upon, the character continued to undergo changes, at one point being from Ireland and at another time being an African American character.[15] Originally, the character of the little girl, known as Mary, became a fearless seven-year-old toughened by years of teasing and pranks from four older brothers.[15] In stark contrast, Johnson is nervous about the possibility of losing his job after the boss at Monsters, Inc. announces a downsizing. He feels envious because another scarer, Ned (who later became Randall), is the company\\'s top performer.[15] Through various drafts, Johnson\\'s occupation went back and forth between scarer and some other position such as a janitor or a refinery worker, until his final incarnation as the best scarer at Monsters, Inc.[15] Throughout development, Pixar worried that having a main character whose main goal was to scare children would alienate audiences and make them not empathize with him. Docter would later describe that the team \"bent over backwards trying to create a story that still had monsters\" while still attempting to solve the problem.[16] A key moment came when the team decided, \"Okay, he\\'s the BEST scarer there. He\\'s the star quarterback\", with Docter noting that before that moment \"design after design, we really didn\\'t know what he was about.\"[16] Disney noted to Pixar early on that they did not want the character to \"look like a guy in a suit\".[16] To this end, Johnson was originally planned to have tentacles for feet; however, this caused many problems in early animation tests. The idea was later largely rejected, as it was thought that audiences would be distracted by the tentacles.[20] Mary\\'s age also differed from draft to draft until the writers settled on the age of three. \"We found that the younger she was, the more dependent she was on Sulley\", Docter said.[12]\\n Eventually, Johnson was renamed Sullivan. Sullivan was also planned to wear glasses throughout the film. However, the creators found it a dangerous idea because the eyes were a perfectly readable and clear way of expressing a character\\'s personality; thus, this idea was also rejected.[20]\\n The idea of a monster buddy for the lead monster emerged at an April 6, 1998, \"story summit\" in Burbank with employees from Disney and Pixar. A term coined by Lasseter, a \"story summit\" was a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in only two days.[21] Such a character, the group agreed, would give the lead monster someone to talk to about his predicament. Development artist Ricky Nierva drew a concept sketch of a rounded, one-eyed monster as a concept for the character, and everyone was generally receptive to it.[12] Docter named the character Mike for the father of his friend Frank Oz, a director and Muppet performer.[15] Jeff Pidgeon and Jason Katz story-boarded a test in which Mike helps Sulley choose a tie for work, and Mike Wazowski soon became a vital character in the film.[12] Originally, Mike had no arms and had to use his legs as appendages; however, due to some technical difficulties, arms were soon added to him.[12]\\n Screenwriter Daniel Gerson joined Pixar in 1999 and worked daily on the film with the filmmakers for almost two years. He considered it his first experience in writing a feature film. He explained, \"I would sit with Pete [Docter] and David Silverman and we would talk about a scene and they would tell me what they were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We\\'d get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here\\'s where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further.\"[17]\\n Docter has cited the 1973 film Paper Moon as inspiration for the concept of someone experiencing getting stuck with a kid who turns out to be the real expert, and he credits Lasseter for coming up with the \"laughter is ten times more powerful than fear\" concept.[22]\\n Bill Murray was considered for the voice role of James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan. He screen-tested for the role and was interested, but when Pete Docter was unable to make contact with him, he took it as a \"no\".[23][24] The voice role of Sulley went to John Goodman, the longtime co-star of the comedy series Roseanne and a regular in the films of the Coen brothers. Goodman interpreted the character to himself as the monster equivalent of a National Football League player. \"He\\'s like a seasoned lineman in the tenth year of his career,\" he said at the time. \"He is totally dedicated and a total pro.\"[25] Billy Crystal, regretting having turned down the part of Buzz Lightyear years prior, accepted that of Mike Wazowski, Sulley\\'s one-eyed best friend and scare assistant.[26][27]\\n In November 2000, early in the production of Monsters, Inc., Pixar packed up and moved for the second time after its Lucasfilm Ltd. years.[25] The company\\'s 500 employees had become spread among three buildings, separated by a busy highway. The company moved from Point Richmond to a much bigger campus in Emeryville, co-designed by Lasseter and Steve Jobs.[25]\\n In production, the film differed from earlier Pixar features, as every main character in this movie had its own lead animator – John Kahrs on Sulley, Andrew Gordon on Mike, and Dave DeVan on Boo.[28] Kahrs found that the \"bearlike quality\" of Goodman\\'s voice provided an exceptionally good fit with the character. He faced a difficult challenge, however, in dealing with Sulley\\'s sheer mass; traditionally, animators conveyed a figure\\'s heaviness by giving it a slower, more belabored movement, but Kahrs was concerned that such an approach to a central character would give the film a \"sluggish\" feel.[28] Like Goodman, Kahrs came to think of Sulley as a football player, one whose athleticism enabled him to move quickly in spite of his size. To help the animators with Sulley and other large monsters, Pixar arranged for Rodger Kram, a University of California, Berkeley expert on the locomotion of heavy mammals, to lecture on the subject.[28]\\n Adding to Sulley\\'s lifelike appearance was an intense effort by the technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals\\' faces in the 1995 film Babe.[28] This film, however, required fur on a much larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar\\'s engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was to figure out how to animate a large number of hairs – 2,320,413 of them on Sulley – in a reasonably efficient way,[28] and another was to make sure that the hairs cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, the hair on Andy\\'s toddler sister, as seen in that movie\\'s opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).[28]\\n The first fur test allowed Sulley to run an obstacle course. Results were not satisfactory, as such objects caught and stretched out the fur due to the extreme amount of motion. Another similar test was also unsuccessful, because, this time, the fur went through the objects.[20]\\n Pixar then set up a Simulation department and created a new fur simulation program called Fizt (short for \"physics tool\").[29] After a shot with Sulley in it had been animated, this department took the data for that shot and added Sulley\\'s fur. Fizt allowed the fur to react in a more natural way. Every time when Sulley had to move, his fur (automatically) reacted to his movements, thus taking the effects of wind and gravity into account as well. The Fizt program also controlled the movement of Boo\\'s clothes, which provided another \"breakthrough\".[29] The deceptively simple-sounding task of animating cloth was also a challenge because of the hundreds of creases and wrinkles that occur in clothing when the wearer moves.[30] The team also had to solve the complex problem of how to keep cloth untangled – in other words, to keep it from passing through itself when parts of it intersect.[31] Fizt applied the same system to Boo\\'s clothes as to Sulley\\'s fur. First of all, Boo was animated shirtless; the Simulation department then used Fizt to apply the shirt over Boo\\'s body, and every time she moved, her clothes also reacted to her movements in a more natural manner.\\n To solve the problem of cloth-to-cloth collisions, Michael Kass, Pixar\\'s senior scientist, was joined on Monsters, Inc. by David Baraff and Andrew Witkin and developed an algorithm they called \"global intersection analysis\" to handle the problem. The complexity of the shots in the film, including elaborate sets such as the door vault, required more computing power to render than any of Pixar\\'s earlier efforts combined. The render farm in place for Monsters, Inc. was made up of 3500 Sun Microsystems processors, compared with 1400 for Toy Story 2 and only 200 for Toy Story, both built on Sun\\'s own RISC-based SPARC processor architecture.[31]\\n The scene in which the Harryhausen\\'s restaurant was decontaminated was originally going to feature the restaurant being blown up.[32] Due to the September 11 attacks, the explosion was replaced by a plasma dome.[33][34][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]\\n Monsters Inc. was Randy Newman\\'s fourth feature film collaboration with Pixar. The end credits song \"If I Didn\\'t Have You\" was sung by John Goodman and Billy Crystal.[17]\\n The album was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score and a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.[35] The score lost both these awards to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, but after sixteen nominations, the song \"If I Didn\\'t Have You\" finally won Newman his first Academy Award for Best Original Song. During his acceptance speech, he jokingly said \"I don\\'t want your pity\".[35][36] It also won a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[35]\\n In October 2000, a teaser trailer of Monsters, Inc. was unveiled, which could not only be found online, but was also attached to the home video releases of Toy Story 2.[37] This trailer would be attached to 102 Dalmatians theatrically and can later be seen on the DVD release of The Emperor\\'s New Groove, which was released on May 1, 2001.[38] Another Monsters, Inc. trailer premiered in theaters in June 2001 with the release of Atlantis: The Lost Empire.[39]\\n Several Happy Meal toys based on the film were released by McDonald\\'s.[40] Meanwhile, Hasbro debuted their own Monsters, Inc. toys at the North American International Toy Fair event.[41]\\n The film premiered on October 28, 2001, at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California.[42] It was theatrically released on November 2, 2001 in the United States, in Australia on December 26, 2001, and in the United Kingdom on February 8, 2002.[43] The theatrical release was accompanied by the Pixar short animated film For the Birds.[44]\\n As with A Bug\\'s Life and Toy Story 2, a montage of \"outtakes\" and a performance of a play based on a line from the film were made and included in the end credits of the film starting on December 7, 2001.[45]\\n After the success of the 3D re-release of The Lion King,[46] Disney and Pixar re-released Monsters, Inc. in 3D on December 19, 2012.[47]\\n Monsters, Inc. was released on VHS and DVD on September 17, 2002.[48][49] Both releases are THX certified and feature the animated shorts Mike\\'s New Car and For the Birds.[50] The DVD release presents the film in widescreen and fullscreen, both taken from the digital source by Pixar. The widescreen version additionally includes filmmakers\\' commentary and a sound effects-only audio track. On the second disc, there are a variety of bonus features including animated shorts, outtakes, the \"If I Didn\\'t Have You\" music video, and more.[51] This release set records for the highest single-day DVD sales with 5 million copies being sold on its first day.[52] Although this record was surpassed by Spider-Man two months later, the film continued to hold the highest single-day record for an animated movie until 2003 when Finding Nemo took it.[53] The film was then released on Blu-ray on November 10, 2009,[54] and on Blu-ray 3D on February 19, 2013.[55] While the 2009 Blu-ray release featured a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound track, the 2013 reissue and its 3D counterpart feature a 7.1 channel Dolby TrueHD track.[56]  Monsters, Inc. was released on 4K Blu-ray on March 3, 2020.[57]\\n On its first day of release, Monsters, Inc. earned $17.8\\xa0million, then generated $26.9\\xa0million the following day, making the latter the second-highest Saturday gross of all time, behind The Mummy Returns.[58] It ranked number one at the box office upon opening, beating out K-PAX, Thirteen Ghosts, Domestic Disturbance, and The One.[58] The film\\'s debut also led to audience declines of From Hell, Riding in Cars with Boys, Training Day, Bandits, and other films.[58] Monsters, Inc. held the record for having the biggest opening weekend of an animated film, making $62,577,067 and surpassing the previous record held by Toy Story 2.[59] It would last for two years until the release of Finding Nemo in May 2003.[60] The film was ranked as the biggest three-day opening weekend for a Disney film, dethroning Pearl Harbor. It was even the fourth film of the year to reach $60\\xa0million within its first three days of release, just after The Mummy Returns, Planet of the Apes, and Rush Hour 2.[61] The film had a small drop-off of 27.2% over its second weekend, earning another $45,551,028, while also outgrossing Shallow Hal and Heist to remain at the top spot.[62] In its third weekend, the film experienced a larger decline of 50.1%, placing itself in the second position just after Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone. In its fourth weekend, however, there was an increase of 5.9%, making $24,055,001 that weekend for a combined $528\\xa0million. As of May 2013, it is the eighth-biggest fourth weekend ever for a film.[63][64]\\n The film made $289,916,256 in North America, and $287,509,478 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $577,425,734.[1] The film is Pixar\\'s ninth highest-grossing film worldwide and sixth in North America.[65] For a time, the film surpassed Aladdin as the second highest-grossing animated film of all time, only behind 1994\\'s The Lion King.[31]\\n In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Malta, it earned £37,264,502 ($53,335,579), marking the sixth highest-grossing animated film of all time in the country and the thirty-second highest-grossing film of all time.[66] In Japan, although earning $4,471,902 during its opening and ranking second behind The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring for the weekend, it moved to first place on subsequent weekends due to exceptionally small decreases or even increases and dominated for six weeks at the box office. It finally reached $74,437,612, standing as 2001\\'s third highest-grossing film and the third largest U.S. animated feature of all time in the country behind Toy Story 3 and Finding Nemo.[67]\\n Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 96% based on 200 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Clever, funny, and delightful to look at, Monsters, Inc. delivers another resounding example of how Pixar elevated the bar for modern all-ages animation.\"[68] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[69] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, becoming the second Pixar film to gain the score after Toy Story 2.[70]\\n Charles Taylor of Salon magazine stated, \"[i]t\\'s agreeable and often funny, and adults who take their kids to see it might be surprised to find themselves having a pretty good time.\"[71] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave it a positive review, praising the film\\'s usage of \"creative energy\", saying \"There hasn\\'t been a film in years to use creative energy as efficiently as Monsters, Inc.\"[72] Although Mike Clark of USA Today thought the comedy was sometimes \"more frenetic than inspired and viewer emotions are rarely touched to any notable degree\", he also viewed the film as \"visually inventive as its Pixar predecessors\".[73]\\n ReelViews film critic James Berardinelli gave the film 31⁄2 stars out of 4 and wrote that the film was \"one of those rare family films that parents can enjoy (rather than endure) along with their kids\".[74] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it \"cheerful, high-energy fun, and like the other Pixar movies, has a running supply of gags and references aimed at grownups\".[75] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"B+\" grade and praised its animation, stating \"Everything from Pixar Animation Studios – the snazzy, cutting-edge computer animation outfit – looks really, really terrific and unspools with a liberated, heppest-moms-and-dads-on-the-block iconoclasm.\"[76]\\n Monsters, Inc. won the Academy Award for Best Original Song (Randy Newman, after fifteen previous nominations, for \"If I Didn\\'t Have You\").[35] It was one of the first animated films to be nominated for Best Animated Feature (lost to Shrek).[35] It was also nominated for Best Original Score (lost to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring) and Best Sound Editing (lost to Pearl Harbor).[77][35] At the Kid\\'s Choice Awards in 2002, it was nominated for \"Favorite Voice in an Animated Movie\" for Billy Crystal (who lost to Eddie Murphy in Shrek).[35]\\n Shortly before the film\\'s release, Pixar was sued by children\\'s songwriter Lori Madrid of Wyoming, stating that the company had stolen her ideas from her 1997 poem \"There\\'s a Boy in My Closet\".\\n Madrid mailed her poem to six publishers in October 1999, notably Chronicle Books, before turning it into a local stage musical in August 2001. After seeing the trailer for Monsters, Inc., Madrid concluded that Chronicle Books had passed her work to Pixar and that the film was based on her work.[79] In October 2001, she filed the suit against Chronicle Books, Pixar, and Disney in a federal court in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Her lawyer asked the court to issue a preliminary injunction, that would forbid Pixar and Disney from releasing the film while the suit was pending.\\n In a hearing on November 1, 2001, the day before the film\\'s scheduled release, the judge refused to issue the injunction. On June 26, 2002, he ruled that the film had nothing in common with the poem.[80]\\n In November 2002, Stanley Mouse filed a lawsuit in which he alleged that the characters of Mike and Sulley were based on drawings of Excuse My Dust, a film that he had tried to sell to Hollywood in 1998.[81] The lawsuit also stated that a story artist from Pixar visited Mouse in 2000 and discussed Mouse\\'s work with him.[81] A Disney spokeswoman responded, saying that the characters in Monsters, Inc. were \"developed independently by the Pixar and Walt Disney Pictures creative teams, and do not infringe on anyone\\'s copyrights\".[78] The case was ultimately settled under undisclosed terms.[82][unreliable source]\\n A prequel, titled Monsters University, was released on June 21, 2013. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi reprised their roles of Sulley, Mike, and Randall, while Dan Scanlon directed the film. The prequel\\'s plot focuses on Sulley and Mike\\'s studies at Monsters University, where they start off as rivals but soon become best friends.\\n An animated short, Mike\\'s New Car, was made by Pixar in 2002 in which the two main characters have assorted misadventures with a car Mike has just bought. This film was not screened in theaters, but is included with all home video releases of Monsters, Inc., and on Pixar\\'s Dedicated Shorts DVD.[83] In August 2002, a manga version of Monsters, Inc. was made by Hiromi Yamafuji and distributed in Kodansha\\'s Comic Bon Bon magazine in Japan; the manga was published in English by Tokyopop until it went out of print.[84] A series of video games, including a multi-platform video game were created based on the film. The video games included Monsters, Inc., Monsters, Inc. Scream Team and Monsters, Inc. Scream Arena.[85] A game titled Monsters, Inc. Run was released on the App Store for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad on December 13, 2012.[86]\\n Feld Entertainment toured a Monsters, Inc. edition of their Walt Disney\\'s World on Ice skating tour from 2003 to 2007.[87] Monsters, Inc. has inspired three attractions at Disney theme parks around the world. In 2006 Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue! opened at Disneyland Resort\\'s Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, California.[88] In 2007, Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor opened at Walt Disney World Resort\\'s Magic Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, replacing The Timekeeper. The show is improvisational in nature, and features the opportunity for Guests to interact with the monster comedians and submit jokes of their own via text message.[89] In 2009 Monsters, Inc. Ride & Go Seek opened at Tokyo Disney Resort\\'s Tokyo Disneyland in Chiba, Japan.[90]\\n In 2009, Boom! Studios produced a Monsters Inc. comic book mini-series that ran for four issues. The storyline takes place after the movie and focuses on Sulley and Mike\\'s daily struggles to operate Monsters Inc. on its new laughter-focused company policy. At the same time, their work is impeded by the revenge schemes of Randall and Waternoose, as well as a human child (indirectly revealed to be Sid Phillips from the Toy Story franchise) who has hijacked the company\\'s closet door technology to commit a string of toy thefts throughout the human world.[91]\\n Sulley, Mike, Boo, Randall, Celia and Roz appear as playable characters in the video game Disney Magic Kingdoms, being unlocked during the progress of the game\\'s main storyline.[92]\\n A world based on the film made its debut appearance in the Kingdom Hearts series in Kingdom Hearts III,[93][94] making it the second Disney-Pixar movie featured in the series after Toy Story.[95][96] The world takes place after the events of the first film.\\n In November 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger spoke about plans to develop a television series spin-off of Monsters, Inc. among other properties owned by the company.[97][98][99] By November of the following year the series was confirmed for Disney+, and would continue the story of the previous films.[100] On April 9, 2019, it was announced that Goodman, Crystal, and Tilly would return as Mike, Sulley, and Celia, respectively for the series. Peterson returns as Roz and also voices her twin sister Roze. Additional cast members include Ben Feldman as Tylor Tuskmon, Mindy Kaling as Val, Henry Winkler as Fritz, Lucas Neff as Duncan, Alanna Ubach as Cutter, Stephen Stanton as Needleman and Smitty (replacing Gerson), and Aisha Tyler as Tylor\\'s mother Millie. In addition, Ratzenberger returns as Yeti and also voices Tylor\\'s father Bernard.[101] It was released on Disney+ on July 7, 2021.[102][103] The series begins the day after Waternoose\\'s arrest and follows Tylor who hopes to be promoted to the Laugh Floor.[104]', 'Coco commonly refers to:\\n Coco may also refer to:', 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (also simply known as Tom Sawyer) is a picaresque novel by Mark Twain published on 9 June 1876 about a boy, Tom Sawyer, growing up along the Mississippi River. It is set in the 1840s in the town of St. Petersburg, which is based on Hannibal, Missouri, where Twain lived as a boy.[2] In the novel, Sawyer has several adventures, often with his friend Huckleberry Finn. Originally a commercial failure, the book ended up being the best-selling of Twain\\'s works during his lifetime.[3][4]\\nThough overshadowed by its 1885 sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, the book is considered by many to be a masterpiece of American literature.[5] It is alleged by Mark Twain to be one of the first novels to be written on a typewriter.[6]\\n Orphan Tom Sawyer lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother Sid in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, sometime in the 1840s. He frequently skips school to play or go swimming. When Polly catches him sneaking home late on a Friday evening and discovers that he has been in a fight, she makes him whitewash her fence the next day as punishment.\\n Tom persuades several neighborhood children to trade him small trinkets and treasures for the \"privilege\" of doing his work, using reverse psychology to convince them of its enjoyable nature. Later, Tom trades the trinkets with students in his Sunday school class for tickets given out for memorizing verses of Scripture. He collects enough tickets to earn a prized Bible from the teacher, despite being one of the worst students in the class and knowing almost nothing of Scripture, eliciting envy from the students and a mixture of pride and shock from the adults.\\n Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a girl who is new in town. Tom wins the admiration of her father, the prominent Judge Thatcher, in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize, but reveals his ignorance when he cannot answer basic questions about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get \"engaged\" by kissing her. Their romance soon collapses when she discovers that Tom was \"engaged\" to another schoolgirl, Amy Lawrence.\\n Becky spurns Tom, who accompanies Huckleberry Finn, a vagrant boy whom all the other boys admire, to a graveyard at midnight to perform a ritual intended to heal warts. At the graveyard, they witness three body snatchers, Dr. Robinson, Muff Potter and Injun Joe, robbing a grave. A fight breaks out, during which Robinson knocks Potter unconscious and is then murdered by Injun Joe. When Potter wakes up, Injun Joe puts the weapon in his hand and tells him that he killed Robinson while drunk. Tom and Huck swear a blood oath not to tell anyone about the murder, fearing that Injun Joe will find out and kill them for revenge. Potter is arrested and jailed to await trial, not disputing Injun Joe\\'s claim.\\n Tom grows bored with school, and he, his friend/classmate Joe Harper, and Huck run away to Jackson\\'s Island in the Mississippi River to begin life as \"pirates\". While enjoying their freedom, they notice the community is scouring the river for their bodies, as the boys are missing and presumed dead. Tom sneaks back home one night to observe the commotion and, after a moment of remorse at his loved ones\\' suffering, conceives a plan to attend his own funeral. The three carry out this scheme, appearing at church in the middle of their joint funeral service and winning the respect of their classmates for the stunt. Back in school, Becky rips a page in the school master\\'s anatomy book after Tom startles her, but Tom regains her admiration by claiming responsibility for the damage and accepting the punishment that would have been hers.\\n During Potter\\'s murder trial, Tom breaks his oath with Huck and testifies for the defense, identifying Injun Joe as the actual culprit. Injun Joe flees the courtroom before he can be apprehended; Potter is acquitted, but Tom and Huck now live in fear for their lives. \\n Once school lets out for the summer, Tom and Huck decide to hunt for buried treasure in the area. While investigating an abandoned house, they are interrupted by the arrival of two men; one of them is a Spaniard, supposedly deaf-mute, who is actually Injun Joe in disguise. He and his partner plan to bury some stolen treasure in the house, but inadvertently discover a hoard of gold coins while doing so. They decide to move it to a new hiding place, which Tom and Huck are determined to find. One night, Huck follows the men, who plan to break into the home of the wealthy Widow Douglas so Injun Joe can mutilate her face in revenge for being publicly whipped for vagrancy − a punishment handed down by her late husband, a justice of the peace. Huck summons help and prevents the break-in, but asks that his name not be made public for fear of retaliation by Injun Joe.\\n Shortly before Huck stops the crime, Tom goes on a picnic to a local cave with Becky and their classmates. Tom and Becky become lost and wander in the cave for days, facing starvation and dehydration. Becky becomes dehydrated and weak, and Tom\\'s search for a way out grows more desperate. He encounters Injun Joe by chance, but is not seen. He eventually finds an exit, and he and Becky are joyfully welcomed back to town, learning that they have been missing for three days and traveled five miles (eight kilometers) from the entrance. Judge Thatcher has the cave\\'s entrance door reinforced and locked. When Tom hears of this action two weeks later, he is horror-stricken, knowing that Injun Joe is still inside. He directs a posse to the cave, where they find Injun Joe dead of starvation just inside the entrance.\\n A week later, having deduced from Injun Joe\\'s presence that the stolen gold must be hidden in the cave, Tom takes Huck there in search of it. They find the gold, which totals over $12,000 (equivalent to $392,000 in 2023) and is invested on their behalf. The Widow Douglas adopts Huck, who finds the restrictions of a civilized home life painful, attempting to escape back to his vagrant life. He reluctantly returns to the widow, persuaded by Tom\\'s offer to form a high-class robber gang.\\n The novel has elements of humor, satire and social criticism – features that later made Mark Twain one of the most important authors of American literature. Mark Twain describes some autobiographical events in the book. The novel\\'s setting of St. Petersburg is based on Twain\\'s actual boyhood home of Hannibal, near St. Louis, and many of the places in it are real and today support a tourist industry as a result.[7]\\n The concept of boyhood is developed through Tom\\'s actions, including his runaway adventure with Joe and Huckleberry. To help show how mischievous and messy boyhood was, The Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs shows a picture of a young boy smoking a pipe, sawing furniture, climbing all over the place, and sleeping. In Twain\\'s novel, Tom and his friend are young when they decide they want to learn how to smoke a pipe. Tom and Joe do this to show just how cool they are to the other boys.[8]\\n Tom Sawyer was Twain\\'s first attempt to write a novel. He had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives (The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims\\' Progress, Roughing It) and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time. These are The Story of the Good Boy and The Story of the Wicked Little Boy which are satirical texts of a few pages. In the first, a model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared. In the second story, an evil little boy steals and lies, like Tom Sawyer, but finishes rich and successful. Tom appears as a mixture of these little boys since he is at the same time a scamp and a boy endowed with a certain generosity.\\n By the time he wrote Tom Sawyer, Twain was already a successful author based on the popularity of The Innocents Abroad. He owned a large house in Hartford, Connecticut, but needed another success to support himself, with a wife and two daughters. He had collaborated on a novel with Charles Dudley Warner, The Gilded Age, published in 1874.[9]\\n He had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the Mississippi and had corresponded with a boyhood friend, Will Bowen, both of which had evoked many memories and were used as source material.\\n Twain named his fictional character after a San Francisco fireman whom he met in June 1863. The real Tom Sawyer was a local hero, famous for rescuing 90 passengers after a shipwreck. The two remained friendly during Twain\\'s three-year stay in San Francisco, often drinking and gambling together.[10]\\n In November 1875, Twain gave the manuscript to Elisha Bliss of the American Publishing Company, who sent it to True Williams for the illustrations. A little later, Twain had the text also quickly published at Chatto and Windus of London, in June 1876, but without illustration. Pirate editions appeared very quickly in Canada and Germany. The American Publishing Company finally published its edition in December 1876, which was the first illustrated edition of Tom Sawyer.[11]\\n A third person narrator describes the experiences of the boys, interspersed with occasional social commentary. In its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain changes to a first person narrative.[12] The two other subsequent books, Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective, are similarly in the first person narrative from the perspective of Huckleberry Finn.\\n The book has raised controversy for its use of the racial epithet \"nigger\"; a bowdlerized version aroused indignation among some literary critics.[13]\\n The book has been criticized for its caricature-like portrayal of Native Americans through the character Injun Joe. He is depicted as malevolent for the sake of malevolence, is not allowed to redeem himself in any way by Twain, dies a pitiful and despairing death in a cave and upon his death is treated as a tourist attraction. Revard suggests that the adults in the novel blame the character\\'s Indian blood as the cause of his evil.[14]\\n Tom Sawyer, the story\\'s title character, also appears in two other uncompleted sequels: Huck and Tom Among the Indians and Tom Sawyer\\'s Conspiracy. He is also a character in Twain\\'s unfinished Schoolhouse Hill.\\n Tom Sawyer: A Ballet in Three Acts premiered on October 14, 2011, at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City, Missouri. The score was by composer Maury Yeston, with choreography by William Whitener, artistic director of the Kansas City Ballet.[37][38] A review in The New York Times observed: \"It’s quite likely that this is the first all-new, entirely American three-act ballet: it is based on an American literary classic, has an original score by an American composer and was given its premiere by an American choreographer and company. ... Both the score and the choreography are energetic, robust, warm, deliberately naïve (both ornery and innocent), in ways right for Twain.\"[39]\\n The Adventures of Tom Sawyer has been adapted into comic book form many times:\\n On November 30, 2011, to celebrate Twain\\'s 176th birthday, the Google Doodle was a scene from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.[42]', 'Little Women is a coming-of-age novel written by American novelist Louisa May Alcott, originally published in two volumes, in 1868 and 1869.[1][2] The story follows the lives of the four March sisters—Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy—and details their passage from childhood to womanhood. Loosely based on the lives of the author and her three sisters,[3][4]:\\u200a202\\u200a it is classified as an autobiographical or semi-autobiographical novel.[5][6]:\\u200a12\\u200a\\n Little Women was an immediate commercial and critical success, and readers were eager for more about the characters. Alcott quickly completed a second volume (titled Good Wives in the United Kingdom, though the name originated with the publisher and not Alcott). It was also met with success. The two volumes were issued in 1880 as a single novel titled Little Women. Alcott subsequently wrote two sequels to her popular work, both also featuring the March sisters: Little Men (1871) and Jo\\'s Boys (1886).\\n The novel has been said to address three major themes: \"domesticity, work, and true love, all of them interdependent and each necessary to the achievement of its heroine\\'s individual identity.\"[7]:\\u200a200\\u200a According to Sarah Elbert, Alcott created a new form of literature, one that took elements from romantic children\\'s fiction and combined it with others from sentimental novels, resulting in a totally new genre. Elbert argues that within Little Women can be found the first vision of the \"All-American girl\" and that her various aspects are embodied in the differing March sisters.[7]:\\u200a199\\u200a\\n The book has been translated into numerous languages, and frequently adapted for stage and screen.\\n In 1868, Alcott\\'s publisher, Thomas Niles, recommended that she write a novel about girls that would have widespread appeal.[4]:\\u200a2\\u200a Alcott resisted, preferring to publish a collection of short stories, instead.  Niles pressed her to write the girls\\' book first, however, and he was aided by her father, Amos Bronson Alcott, who also urged her to do so.[4]:\\u200a207\\u200a Louisa confided to a friend, \"I could not write a girls\\' story knowing little about any but my sisters and always preferring boys\".[8]\\n In May 1868, Alcott wrote in her journal: \"Niles, partner of Roberts, asked me to write a girl\\'s book. I said I\\'d try.\"[9]:\\u200a36\\u200a Alcott set her novel in an imaginary Orchard House modeled on her residence of the same name, where she wrote the novel.[4]:\\u200axiii\\u200a She, later, recalled that she did not think she could write a successful book for girls and did not enjoy writing it.[10]:\\u200a335-\\u200a \"I plod away,\" she wrote in her diary, \"although, I don\\'t enjoy this sort of things.\"[9]:\\u200a37\\u200a\\n By June, Alcott had sent the first dozen chapters to Niles, and both agreed that they were dull. But Niles\\'s niece, Lillie Almy, read them and said she enjoyed them.[10]:\\u200a335–336\\u200a The completed manuscript was shown to several girls who agreed it was \"splendid.\"  Alcott wrote, \"they are the best critics, so, I should definitely be satisfied.\"[9]:\\u200a37\\u200a She wrote Little Women \"in record time for money\",[7]:\\u200a196x2\\u200a but the book\\'s immediate success surprised both her and her publisher.[11]\\n According to literary critic Sarah Elbert, when using the term \"little women\" Alcott was drawing on its Dickensian meaning; it represented the period in a young woman\\'s life where childhood and elder childhood are \"overlapping\" with young womanhood. Each of the March sister heroines has a harrowing experience that alerts them and the reader that \"childhood innocence\" is of the past, and that \"the inescapable woman problem\" is all that remains.[7][page\\xa0needed]\\n The March sisters – Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy – and their mother, whom they call Marmee, live in a new neighborhood (loosely based on Concord) in Massachusetts in genteel poverty. Having lost all his money, their father is serving as a chaplain for the Union Army in the American Civil War, far from home. The mother and daughters face their first Christmas without him. When Marmee asks them to give their Christmas breakfast away to an impoverished family, the girls and their mother venture into town, laden with baskets, to feed the hungry children. When they return, they discover their wealthy, elderly neighbor, Mr. Laurence, has sent over a decadent surprise dinner, to make up for their breakfast. The two families become acquainted, following these acts of kindness.\\n Meg and Jo must work to support the family: Meg tutors a nearby family of four children; Jo assists her aged great-aunt March, a wealthy widow living in a mansion in Plumfield. Beth, too timid for school, is content to stay at home and help with housework; and Amy is still at school. Meg is beautiful and traditional, Jo is a tomboy who writes, Beth is a peacemaker and a pianist, and Amy is an artist who longs for elegance and fine society. The sisters strive to help their family and improve their characters, as Meg is vain, Jo is hotheaded, Beth is cripplingly shy, and Amy is materialistic. The neighbor boy, Laurie, the orphaned grandson of Mr. Laurence, becomes close friends with the sisters, particularly the tomboyish Jo.\\n The girls keep busy, as the war goes on. Jo writes a novel that gets published but is frustrated to have to edit it down and can\\'t comprehend the conflicting critical response. Meg is invited to spend two weeks with rich friends, where there are parties and cotillions for the girls to dance with boys and improve their social skills. Laurie is invited to one of the dances, and Meg\\'s friends incorrectly think she is in love with him. Meg is more interested in John Brooke, Laurie\\'s young tutor.\\n Word comes that Mr. March is very ill with pneumonia and Marmee is called away to nurse him in Washington, DC. Mr. Laurence offers to accompany her, but she declines, knowing travel would be uncomfortable for the old man. Mr. Laurence, instead, sends John Brooke to do his business in Washington and help the Marches. While in Washington, Brooke confesses his love for Meg to her parents. They are pleased but consider Meg too young to marry, so, Brooke agrees to wait.\\n While Marmee is in Washington, Beth contracts scarlet fever, after spending time with a poor family, where three children die. As a precaution, Amy is sent to live with Aunt March and replaces Jo as her companion and helper. Jo, who already had scarlet fever, tends to Beth. After many days of illness, the family doctor advises that Marmee be sent for, immediately. Beth recovers, but never fully regains her health and energy.\\n While Brooke waits for Meg to come of age to marry, he joins the military and serves in the war. After he is wounded, he returns to find work, so he can buy a house and be ready, when he marries Meg. Laurie goes off to college. On Christmas Day, a year after the book\\'s opening, the girls\\' father returns home.\\n (Published separately in the United Kingdom as Good Wives)\\n Three years later, Meg and John marry and learn how to live together. When they have twins, Meg is a devoted mother, but John begins to feel neglected and left out. Meg seeks advice from Marmee, who helps her find balance in her married life by making more time for wifely duties and encouraging John to become more involved with child rearing.\\n Laurie graduates from college, having put in the effort to do well in his last year, with Jo\\'s prompting. Amy is chosen over Jo to go on a European tour with her aunt. Beth\\'s health is weak, due to complications from scarlet fever, and her spirits are down. While trying to uncover the reason for Beth\\'s sadness, Jo realizes that Laurie has fallen in love. At first she believes it\\'s with Beth, but soon senses it\\'s with herself. Jo confides in Marmee, telling her that she loves Laurie like a brother and that she could not love him in a romantic way.\\n Jo decides she wants a bit of adventure and to put distance between herself and Laurie, hoping he will forget his feelings. She spends six months with a friend of her mother who runs a boarding house in New York City, serving as governess for her two children. Jo takes German lessons with another boarder, Professor Friedrich Bhaer. He has come to America from Berlin to care for the orphaned sons of his sister. For extra money, Jo writes salacious romance stories, anonymously, for sensational newspapers. Suspecting her secret, Friedrich mentions such writing is unprincipled and base. Jo is persuaded to give up that type of writing, as her time in New York comes to an end, unaware that Friedrich has fallen in love with her. When she returns to Massachusetts, Laurie proposes marriage, and she declines.\\n Laurie travels to Europe with his grandfather, to escape his heartbreak. At home, the lasting results of Beth\\'s scarlet fever slowly begin to kill her. Jo devotes her time to the care of her dying sister. Laurie encounters Amy in Europe, and he slowly falls in love with her, as he begins to see her in a new light. She is unimpressed by the aimless, idle, and forlorn attitude he has adopted, since being rejected by Jo, and she inspires him to find his purpose and do something worthwhile with his life. With the news of Beth\\'s death, they meet for consolation, and their romance grows. Amy\\'s aunt will not allow Amy to return, unchaperoned, with Laurie and his grandfather, so, they marry, before returning home from Europe.\\n Friedrich is in Massachusetts on business and visits the Marches, daily, for two weeks. On his last day, he proposes to Jo, and the two become engaged, as she realizes she loves him. Because the Professor is poor, the wedding must wait, while he establishes a good income by going out west to teach. A year goes by without much success; later, Aunt March dies and leaves her large estate, Plumfield, to Jo, who marries Friedrich and turns the house into a school. They have two sons of their own, and Amy and Laurie have a daughter. At apple-picking time, Marmee celebrates her 60th birthday at Plumfield, with her husband, her three surviving daughters, their husbands, and her five grandchildren.\\n Meg, the oldest sister, is 16, when the story starts. She is described as a beauty, and she manages the household, when her mother is absent. She has long brown hair and blue eyes and particularly beautiful hands, and she is seen as the prettiest one of the sisters. Meg fulfils expectations for women of the time; from the start, she is already a nearly perfect \"little woman,\" in the eyes of the world.[12] Before her marriage to John Brooke, while still living at home, she often lectures her younger sisters to ensure they grow to embody the title of \"little women\".[13]\\n Meg is employed as a governess for the Kings, a wealthy local family. Because of their father\\'s family\\'s social standing, Meg makes her debut into high society, but she is lectured by her friend and neighbor, Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence, for behaving like a snob. Meg marries John Brooke, Laurie\\'s tutor. They have twins, Margaret \"Daisy\" Brooke and John Laurence \"Demi\" Brooke. The sequel, Little Men, mentions a baby daughter, Josephine \"Josie\" Brooke,[14] who is 14, at the beginning of the final book.[15]\\n According to Sarah Elbert, \"democratic domesticity requires maturity, strength, and above all, a secure identity that Meg lacks\".[7]:\\u200a204\\u200a Others believe Alcott does not intend to belittle Meg for her ordinary life and writes her with loving detail, suffused with sentimentality.[16]\\n The principal character, Jo, 15 years old at the beginning of the book, is a strong and willful young woman, struggling to subdue her fiery temper and stubborn personality.[17][18]\\n Second oldest of the four sisters, Jo is masculine, the smartest, most creative one in the family; her father has referred to her as his \"son Jo,\" and her best friend and neighbour, Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence, sometimes calls her \"my dear fellow,\" while she, alone, calls him Teddy. Jo has a \"hot\" temper that often leads her into trouble. With the help of her own misguided sense of humor, her sister, Beth, and her mother, she works on controlling it. It has been said that much of Louisa May Alcott shows through in these characteristics of Jo.[19] In her essay, \"Recollections of My Childhood,\" Alcott refers to herself as a tomboy who enjoyed boys\\' activities, like running foot-races and climbing trees.\\n Jo loves literature, both reading and writing. She composes plays for her sisters to perform and writes short stories. She initially rejects the idea of marriage and romance, feeling that it would break up her family and separate her from the sisters whom she adores. While pursuing a literary career in New York City, she meets Friedrich Bhaer, a German professor. On her return home, Laurie proposes marriage to Jo, which she rejects, thus confirming her independence. Another reason for the rejection is that the love that Laurie has for Jo is more a brotherly love, rather than romantic love, the difference between which he was unable to understand, because he was \"just a boy,\" as said by Alcott in the book.\\n After Beth dies, Professor Bhaer woos Jo at her home, when \"they decide to share life\\'s burdens, just as they shared the load of bundles on their shopping expedition\".[7]:\\u200a210\\u200a She is 25 years old when she accepts his proposal. The marriage is deferred, until her unexpected inheritance of her Aunt March\\'s home, a year later. According to critic Barbara Sicherman, \"The crucial first point is that the choice is hers, its quirkiness another sign of her much-prized individuality.\"[20]:\\u200a21\\u200a They have two sons, Robert \"Rob\" Bhaer and Theodore \"Ted\" Bhaer. Jo also writes the first part of Little Women during the second portion of the novel. According to Elbert, \"her narration signals a successfully completed adolescence\".[7]:\\u200a199\\u200a\\n Beth, 13 when the story starts, is described as kind, gentle, sweet, shy, quiet, honest, and musical. She is the shyest March sister and the pianist of the family.[21]:\\u200a53\\u200a Infused with quiet wisdom, she is the peacemaker of the family, and she gently scolds her sisters, when they argue.[22] As her sisters grow up, they begin to leave home, but Beth has no desire to leave her house or family. She is especially close to Jo: when Beth develops scarlet fever, after visiting the Hummels, Jo does most of the nursing and rarely leaves her side. Beth recovers from the acute disease, but her health is permanently weakened.\\n As she grows, Beth begins to realize that her time with her loved ones is coming to an end. Finally, the family accepts that Beth will not live much longer. They make a special room for her, filled with all the things she loves best: her kittens, her piano, Father\\'s books, Amy\\'s sketches, and her beloved dolls. She is never idle; she knits and sews things for the children who pass by on their way to and from school. But eventually, she puts down her sewing needle, saying it grew \"heavy.\"  Beth\\'s final sickness has a strong effect on her sisters, especially Jo, who resolves to live her life with more consideration and care for everyone. The main loss during Little Women is the death of beloved Beth. Her \"self-sacrifice is ultimately the greatest in the novel. She gives up her life, knowing that it has had only private, domestic meaning.\"[7]:\\u200a206–207\\u200a\\n Amy is the youngest sister and baby of the family; she\\'s 12, when the story begins. Interested in art, she is described as a \"regular snow-maiden,\" with curly golden hair and blue eyes, \"pale and slender\" and \"always carrying herself\" like a proper young lady. She is the artist of the family.[23] Often coddled, because she is the youngest, Amy can behave in a vain and self-centered way, though she does still love her family.[24]:\\u200a5\\u200a She has the middle name Curtis, and is the only March sister to use her full name, rather than a diminutive.[25]\\n Amy is chosen by her aunt to travel to Europe with her, instead of her sister, Jo. There, she matures and makes a decision, based on her limited artistic talent, how to direct her adult life. She encounters \"Laurie\" Laurence and his grandfather, during the extended visit. Amy is the least inclined of the sisters to sacrifice and self-denial. She behaves well, in upper-class society, and she is at ease, with herself. Critic Martha Saxton observes the author was never fully at ease with Amy\\'s moral development, and her success, in life, seemed relatively accidental.[24] However, Amy\\'s morality does appear to develop, throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, and she can confidently and justly put Laurie in his place, when she believes he is wasting his life on pleasurable activities. Ultimately, Amy is shown to work very hard to gain what she wants and to make the most of her success, when she has it.\\n For her books, Alcott was often inspired by familiar elements. The characters in Little Women are recognizably drawn from family members and friends.[3][4]:\\u200a202\\u200a Her married sister Anna was Meg, the family beauty. Lizzie, Alcott\\'s beloved sister, was the model for Beth. Like Beth, Lizzie was quiet and retiring. Like Beth as well, she died tragically at age twenty-three from the lingering effects of scarlet fever.[36] May, Alcott\\'s strong-willed sister, was portrayed as Amy, whose pretentious affectations cause her occasional downfalls.[4]:\\u200a202\\u200a Alcott portrayed herself as Jo. Alcott readily corresponded with readers who addressed her as \"Miss March\" or \"Jo\", and she did not correct them.[37][38]:\\u200a31\\u200a\\n However, Alcott\\'s portrayal, even if inspired by her family, is an idealized one. For instance, Mr. March is portrayed as a hero of the American Civil War, a gainfully employed chaplain, and, presumably, a source of inspiration to the women of the family. He is absent for most of the novel.[38]:\\u200a51\\u200a In contrast, Bronson Alcott was very present in his family\\'s household, due in part to his inability to find steady work. While he espoused many of the educational principles touted by the March family, he was loud and dictatorial. His lack of financial independence was a source of humiliation to his wife and daughters.[38]:\\u200a51\\u200a The March family is portrayed as living in genteel penury, but the Alcott family, dependent on an improvident, impractical father, suffered real poverty and occasional hunger.[39] In addition to her own childhood and that of her sisters, scholars who have examined the diaries of Louisa Alcott\\'s mother, Abigail Alcott, have surmised that Little Women was also heavily inspired by Abigail Alcott\\'s own early life.[26]:\\u200a6\\u200a Originally, Alcott did not want to publish Little Women, claiming she found it boring, and wasn\\'t sure how to write girls as she knew few beyond her sisters. However, encouraged by her editor Thomas Niles, she wrote it within 10 weeks.[40]\\n Also, Little Women has several textual and structural references to John Bunyan\\'s novel The Pilgrim\\'s Progress.[41] Jo and her sisters read it at the outset of the book and try to follow the good example of Bunyan\\'s Christian. Throughout the novel, the main characters refer many times to The Pilgrim\\'s Progress and liken the events in their own lives to the experiences of the pilgrims. Several chapter titles directly reference characters and places from The Pilgrim\\'s Progress.\\n In addition to drawing on her own life during the development of Little Women, Alcott also took influence from several of her earlier works including \"The Sisters\\' Trial\", \"A Modern Cinderella\", and \"In the Garret\". The characters within these short stories and poems, in addition to Alcott\\'s own family and personal relationships, inspired the general concepts and bases for many of the characters in Little Women.[42]\\n The first volume of Little Women was published in 1868 by Roberts Brothers.[43] The first edition included illustrations by Abigail May Alcott, the sister commonly called \"May\" who inspired the fictional Amy March. She \"struggled\" with her illustrative additions to her sister\\'s book, but later improved her skills and found some success as an artist.[44]\\n The first printing of 2,000 copies sold out quickly, and the company had trouble keeping up with the demand for additional printings. They announced: \"The great literary hit of the season is undoubtedly Miss Alcott\\'s Little Women, the orders for which continue to flow in upon us to such an extent as to make it impossible to answer them with promptness.\"[9]:\\u200a37\\u200a The last line of Chapter 23 in the first volume states: \"So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called Little Women.\"[45] Alcott delivered the manuscript for the second volume on New Year\\'s Day 1869, just three months after publication of part one.[10]:\\u200a345\\u200a\\n Versions in the late 20th and 21st centuries combine both Little Women and Good Wives into one book under the title Little Women, with the latter marked as Part 2 (chapters 24 to 47).[46] Each chapter is numbered and has a title as well. Part 2, Chapter 24 opens with: \"In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg\\'s wedding with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.\"[45] Editions published in the 21st century may be the original text unaltered, the original text with illustrations, the original text annotated for the reader (explaining terms of 1868–69 that are less common now), the original text modernized and abridged, or the original text abridged.[citation needed]\\n The British influence, giving Part 2 its own title, Good Wives, has the book still published in two volumes, with Good Wives beginning three years after Little Women ends, especially in the UK and Canada, but also with some US editions. Some editions listed under Little Women appear to include both parts, especially in the audiobook versions.[citation needed] Editions are shown in continuous print from many publishers, as hardback, paperback, audio, and e-book versions, from the 1980s to 2015.[citation needed]  This split of the two volumes also shows at Goodreads, which refers to the books as the Little Women series, including Little Women, Good Wives, Little Men and Jo\\'s Boys.[citation needed]\\n G. K. Chesterton believed Alcott in Little Women, \"anticipated realism by twenty or thirty years\", and that Fritz\\'s proposal to Jo, and her acceptance, \"is one of the really human things in human literature\".[47] Gregory S. Jackson said that Alcott\\'s use of realism belongs to the American Protestant pedagogical tradition, which includes a range of religious literary traditions with which Alcott was familiar. He has copies in his book of nineteenth-century images of devotional children\\'s guides which provide background for the game of \"pilgrims progress\" that Alcott uses in her plot of Book One.[48]\\n Little Women was well received upon first publication. According to 21st-century critic Barbara Sicherman there was, during the 19th century, a \"scarcity of models for nontraditional womanhood\", which led more women to look toward \"literature for self-authorization. This is especially true during adolescence.\"[20]:\\u200a2\\u200a Little Women became \"the paradigmatic text for young women of the era and one in which family literary culture is prominently featured\".[20]:\\u200a3\\u200a Adult elements of women\\'s fiction in Little Women included \"a change of heart necessary\" for the female protagonist to evolve in the story.[7]:\\u200a199\\u200a\\n In the late 20th century, some scholars criticized the novel. Sarah Elbert, for instance, wrote that Little Women was the beginning of \"a decline in the radical power of women\\'s fiction\", partly because women\\'s fiction was being idealized with a \"hearth and home\" children\\'s story.[7]:\\u200a197\\u200a Women\\'s literature historians and juvenile fiction historians have agreed that Little Women was the beginning of this \"downward spiral\". But Elbert says that Little Women did not \"belittle women\\'s fiction\" and that Alcott stayed true to her \"Romantic birthright\".[7]:\\u200a198–199\\u200a\\n Little Women\\'s popular audience was responsive to ideas of social change as they were shown \"within the familiar construct of domesticity\".[7]:\\u200a220\\u200a While Alcott had been commissioned to \"write a story for girls\", her primary heroine, Jo March, became a favorite of many different women, including educated women writers through the 20th century. The girl story became a \"new publishing category with a domestic focus that paralleled boys\\' adventure stories\".[20]:\\u200a3–4\\u200a\\n One reason the novel was so popular was that it appealed to different classes of women along with those of different national backgrounds, at a time of high immigration to the United States. Through the March sisters, women could relate and dream where they may not have before.[20]:\\u200a3–4\\u200a \"Both the passion Little Women has engendered in diverse readers and its ability to survive its era and transcend its genre point to a text of unusual permeability.\"[20]:\\u200a35\\u200a\\n At the time, young girls perceived that marriage was their end goal. After the publication of the first volume, many girls wrote to Alcott asking her \"who the little women marry\".[20]:\\u200a21\\u200a Sicherman said that the ending, which she personally characterizes as \"unsatisfying\", worked to \"keep the story alive\" as if the reader might find it ended differently upon different readings.[20]:\\u200a21\\u200a Anne E. Boyd contends that \"Alcott particularly battled the conventional marriage plot in writing Little Women\".[49] Alcott did not have Jo accept Laurie\\'s hand in marriage; rather, when she arranged for Jo to marry, she portrayed an unconventional man as her husband. In Sicherman\\'s opinion, Alcott used Friedrich to \"subvert adolescent romantic ideals\" because he was much older and seemingly unsuited for Jo.[20]:\\u200a21\\u200a However, the character was partially based upon older men Alcott was attracted to, such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson,[50][51] or admired, such as German writers Charles Follen and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.[52][53][54] In particular, Alcott had considered Goethe her \"chief idol\" since the day Emerson had introduced her to Goethe and handed her a copy of Wilhelm Meister\\'s Apprenticeship[55] Bhaer is also representative of Alcott\\'s reverence for German culture.[56]\\n In 2003 Little Women was ranked number 18 in The Big Read, a survey of the British public by the BBC to determine the \"Nation\\'s Best-loved Novel\" (not children\\'s novel); it is fourth-highest among novels published in the U.S. on that list.[57] Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association listed it as one of its \"Teachers\\' Top 100 Books for Children\".[58] In 2012 it was ranked number 47 among all-time children\\'s novels in a survey published by School Library Journal, a monthly with primarily US audience.[59]\\n Little Women has been one of the most widely read novels, noted by Stern from a 1927 report in The New York Times and cited in Little Women and the Feminist Imagination: Criticism, Controversy, Personal Essays.[60]  Ruth MacDonald argued that \"Louisa May Alcott stands as one of the great American practitioners of the girls\\' novel and the family story\".[61]\\n In the 1860s, gendered separation of children\\'s fiction was a newer division in literature. This division signaled a beginning of polarization of gender roles as social constructs \"as class stratification increased\".[20]:\\u200a18\\u200a Joy Kasson wrote, \"Alcott chronicled the coming of age of young girls, their struggles with issues such as selfishness and generosity, the nature of individual integrity, and, above all, the question of their place in the world around them.\"[62] Girls related to the March sisters in Little Women, along with following the lead of their heroines, by assimilating aspects of the story into their own lives.[20]:\\u200a22\\u200a\\n After reading Little Women, some women felt the need to \"acquire new and more public identities,\" however dependent on other factors, such as financial resources.[20]:\\u200a55\\u200a While Little Women showed the regular lives of American middle-class girls, it also \"legitimized\" their dreams to do something different and allowed them to consider the possibilities.[20]:\\u200a36\\u200a More young women started writing stories that had adventurous plots and \"stories of individual achievement—traditionally coded male—challenged women\\'s socialization into domesticity\".[20]:\\u200a55\\u200a Little Women also influenced contemporary European immigrants to the United States who wanted to assimilate into the middle-class culture.\\n In the pages of Little Women, young and adolescent girls read the normalization of ambitious women. This provided an alternative to the previously normalized gender roles.[20]:\\u200a35\\u200a Little Women repeatedly reinforced the importance of \"individuality\" and \"female vocation\".[20]:\\u200a26\\u200a Little Women had \"continued relevance of its subject\" and \"its longevity points, as well to surprising continuities in gender norms from the 1860s at least through the 1960s\".[20]:\\u200a35\\u200a Those interested in domestic reform could look to the pages of Little Women to see how a \"democratic household\" would operate.[7]:\\u200a276\\u200a\\n While \"Alcott never questioned the value of domesticity,\" she challenged the social constructs that made spinsters obscure and fringe members of society, solely because they were not married.[7]:\\u200a193\\u200a \"Little Women indisputably enlarges the myth of American womanhood, by insisting that the home and the women\\'s sphere cherish individuality and thus produce young adults who can make their way in the world, while preserving a critical distance from its social arrangements.\" As with all youth, the March girls had to grow up. These sisters, and in particular, Jo, were apprehensive about adulthood, because they were afraid that, by conforming to what society wanted, they would lose their special individuality.[7]:\\u200a199\\u200a\\n Alcott\\'s Jo also made professional writing imaginable for generations of women. Writers as diverse as Maxine Hong Kingston, Margaret Atwood, and J.K. Rowling have noted the influence of Jo March on their artistic development. Even other fictional portraits of young women aspiring to authorship often reference Jo March.[63]\\n Alcott\\'s novel is often celebrated for Jo and her narrative arch in which she becomes a self-determined woman with a career. However, framing this novel as a success, solely for Jo\\'s accomplishments, portrays it as a \"traditional \\'lone genius\\' patriarchal narrative\" in which only women who are \"categorized as \\'exceptional\\' or particularly \\'worthy\\'\" are celebrated.[64] Little Women awards all its women worthy, despite their status as conventional or unconventional—not just Jo, who is the obvious exception to societal expectation. Alcott\\'s novel celebrates the agency of women, the four sisters and their mother, to choose their path in life. Meg makes the decision to marry and have children and though it is the traditional pathway, she makes the choice for her own happiness. Thus, reducing Alcott\\'s novel to just Jo\\'s experience as an exception promotes it as a patriarchal narrative and erases her careful work to portray a matriarchal narrative, rich with female agency and voice. \\n Alcott \"made women\\'s rights integral to her stories, and above all, to Little Women\".[7]:\\u200a193\\u200a Alcott\\'s fiction became her \"most important feminist contribution\"—even considering all the effort Alcott made to help facilitate women\\'s rights\".[7]:\\u200a193\\u200a She thought that \"a democratic household could evolve into a feminist society.\" In Little Women, she imagined that just such an evolution might begin with Plumfield, a nineteenth-century feminist utopia.[7]:\\u200a194\\u200a\\n Little Women has a timeless resonance which reflects Alcott\\'s grasp of her historical framework in the 1860s. The novel\\'s ideas do not intrude themselves upon the reader because the author is wholly in control of the implications of her imaginative structure. Sexual equality is the salvation of marriage and the family; democratic relationships make happy endings. This is the unifying imaginative frame of Little Women.[7]:\\u200a276\\u200a Little Women has been adapted to film seven times. The first adaptation was a silent film directed by Alexander Butler and released in 1917, which starred Daisy Burrell as Amy, Mary Lincoln as Meg, Ruby Miller as Jo, and Muriel Myers as Beth. It is considered a lost film.[71]\\n Another silent film adaptation was released in 1918 and directed by Harley Knoles. It starred Isabel Lamon as Meg, Dorothy Bernard as Jo, Lillian Hall as Beth, and Florence Flinn as Amy. It is also considered a lost film.[72]\\n George Cukor directed the first sound adaptation of Little Women, starring Katharine Hepburn as Jo, Joan Bennett as Amy, Frances Dee as Meg, and Jean Parker as Beth.

It is based on the 1949 memoir of Maria von Trapp, The Story of the Trapp Family Singers. Set in Austria on the eve of the Anschluss in 1938, the musical tells the story of Maria, who takes a job as governess to a large family while she decides whether to become a nun. She falls in love with the children, and eventually their widowed father, Captain von Trapp. He is ordered to accept a commission in the German Navy, but he opposes the Nazis. He and Maria decide on a plan to flee Austria with the children. Many songs from the musical have become standards, including \"Do-Re-Mi\", \"My Favorite Things\", \"Edelweiss\", \"Climb Ev\\'ry Mountain\", and the title song \"The Sound of Music\".\\n The original Broadway production, starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, opened in 1959[1] and won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical, out of nine nominations. The first London production opened at the Palace Theatre in 1961. The show has enjoyed numerous productions and revivals since then. It was adapted as a 1965 film musical starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The Sound of Music was the last musical written by Rodgers and Hammerstein, as Oscar Hammerstein died of stomach cancer nine months after the Broadway premiere.\\n After viewing The Trapp Family, a 1956 West German film about the von Trapp family, and its 1958 sequel (The Trapp Family in America), stage director Vincent J. Donehue thought that the project would be perfect for his friend Mary Martin; Broadway producers Leland Hayward and Richard Halliday (Martin\\'s husband) agreed.[2] The producers originally envisioned a non-musical play that would be written by Lindsay and Crouse and that would feature songs from the repertoire of the Trapp Family Singers. Then they decided to add an original song or two, perhaps by Rodgers and Hammerstein. But it was soon agreed that the project should feature all new songs and be a musical rather than a play.[3]\\n Details of the history of the von Trapp family were altered for the musical. The real Georg von Trapp did live with his family in a villa in Aigen, a suburb of Salzburg. He wrote to the Nonnberg Abbey in 1926 asking for a nun to help tutor his sick daughter, and the Mother Abbess sent Maria. His wife, Agathe Whitehead, had died in 1922. The real Maria and Georg married at the Nonnberg Abbey in 1927. Lindsay and Crouse altered the story so that Maria was governess to all of the children, whose names and ages were changed, as was Maria\\'s original surname (the show used \"Rainer\" instead of \"Kutschera\"). The von Trapps spent some years in Austria after Maria and the Captain married and he was offered a commission in Germany\\'s navy. Since von Trapp opposed the Nazis by that time, the family left Austria after the Anschluss, going by train to Italy and then traveling on to London and the United States.[4] To make the story more dramatic, Lindsay and Crouse had the family, soon after Maria\\'s and the Captain\\'s wedding, escape over the mountains to Switzerland on foot.\\n In Salzburg, Federal State of Austria, just before World War II, nuns from Nonnberg Abbey sing the Dixit Dominus. One of the postulants, Maria Rainer, is on the nearby mountainside, regretting leaving the beautiful hills (\"The Sound of Music\"). She returns late to the abbey where the Mother Abbess and the other nuns have been considering what to do about the free-spirit (\"Maria\"). Maria explains her lateness, saying she was raised on that mountain, and apologizes for singing in the garden without permission. The Mother Abbess joins her in song (\"My Favorite Things\"). The Mother Abbess tells her that she should spend some time outside the abbey to decide whether she is suited for the monastic life. She will act as the governess to the seven children of a widower, Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine Captain Georg von Trapp.\\n Maria arrives at the villa of Captain von Trapp. He explains her duties and summons the children with a boatswain\\'s call. They march in, clad in uniforms. He teaches her their individual signals on the call, but she openly disapproves of this militaristic approach. Alone with them, she breaks through their wariness and teaches them the basics of music (\"Do-Re-Mi\").\\n Rolf, a young messenger, delivers a telegram and then meets with the eldest child, Liesl, outside the villa. He claims he knows what is right for her because he is a year older than she (\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\"). They kiss, and he runs off, leaving her squealing with joy. Meanwhile, the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, gives Maria material to make new clothes, as Maria had given all her possessions to the poor. Maria sees Liesl slipping in through the window, wet from a sudden thunderstorm, but agrees to keep her secret. The other children are frightened by the storm. Maria sings \"The Lonely Goatherd\" to distract them.\\n Captain von Trapp arrives a month later from Vienna with Baroness Elsa Schraeder and Max Detweiler. Elsa tells Max that something is preventing the Captain from marrying her. He opines that only poor people have the time for great romances (\"How Can Love Survive\"). Rolf enters, looking for Liesl, and greets them with \"Heil\". The Captain orders him away, saying that he is Austrian, not German. Maria and the children leapfrog in, wearing play-clothes that she made from the old drapes in her room. Infuriated, the Captain sends them off to change. She tells him that the children need him to show his love for them, and he angrily orders her back to the abbey. As she apologizes, they hear the children singing \"The Sound of Music\", which she had taught them, to welcome Elsa Schraeder. He joins in and embraces them. Alone with Maria, he asks her to stay, thanking her for bringing music back into his house. Elsa is suspicious of her until she explains that she will be returning to the abbey in September.\\n The Captain gives a party to introduce Elsa, and guests argue over the Anschluss (the Nazi German annexation of Austria). Kurt asks Maria to teach him to dance the Ländler. When he fails to negotiate a complicated figure, the Captain steps in to demonstrate. He and Maria dance until they come face-to-face; and she breaks away, embarrassed and confused. Discussing the expected marriage between Elsa and the Captain, Brigitta tells Maria that she thinks Maria and the Captain are really in love with each other. Elsa asks the Captain to allow the children to say goodnight to the guests with a song (\"So Long, Farewell\"). Max is amazed at their talent and wants them for the Kaltzburg Festival, which he is organizing. The guests leave for the dining room, and Maria slips out the front door with her luggage.\\n At the abbey, Maria says that she is ready to take her monastic vows; but the Mother Abbess realizes that she is running away from her feelings. She tells her to face the Captain and discover if they love each other, and tells her to search for and find the life she was meant to live (\"Climb Ev\\'ry Mountain\").\\n Max teaches the children how to sing on stage. When the Captain tries to lead them, they complain that he is not doing it as Maria did. He tells them that he has asked Elsa to marry him. They try to cheer themselves up by singing \"My Favorite Things\" but are unsuccessful until they hear Maria singing on her way to rejoin them. Learning of the wedding plans, she decides to stay only until the Captain can arrange for another governess. Max and Elsa argue with the Captain about the imminent Anschluss, trying to convince him that it is inevitable (\"No Way to Stop It\"). When he refuses to compromise on his opposition to it, Elsa breaks off the engagement. Alone, the Captain and Maria finally admit their love, desiring only to be \"An Ordinary Couple\". As they marry, the nuns reprise \"Maria\" against the wedding processional.\\n While Maria and the Captain are on their honeymoon, Max prepares the children to perform at the Kaltzburg Festival. Herr Zeller, the Gauleiter of the region, demands to know why they are not flying the Flag of Nazi Germany now that the Anschluss has occurred. The Captain and Maria return early from their honeymoon before the Festival. In view of the Nazi German occupation, the Captain decides the children should not sing at the event. Max argues that they would sing for Austria, but the Captain points out that it no longer exists. Maria and Liesl discuss romantic love; Maria predicts that in a few years Liesl will be married (\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen (Reprise)\"). Rolf enters with a telegram that offers the Captain a commission in the German Navy, and Liesl is upset to discover that Rolf is now a committed Nazi. The Captain consults Maria and decides that they must secretly flee Austria. German Admiral von Schreiber arrives to find out why Captain von Trapp has not answered the telegram. He explains that the German Navy holds him in high regard, offers him the commission, and tells him to report immediately to Bremerhaven to assume command. Maria says that he cannot leave immediately, as they are all singing in the Festival concert; and the Admiral agrees to wait.\\n At the concert, after the von Trapps sing an elaborate reprise of \"Do-Re-Mi\", Max brings out the Captain\\'s guitar. Captain von Trapp sings \"Edelweiss\", as a goodbye to his homeland, while using Austria\\'s national flower as a symbol to declare his loyalty to the country. Max asks for an encore and announces that this is the von Trapp family\\'s last chance to sing together, as the honor guard waits to escort the Captain to his new command. While the judges decide on the prizes, the von Trapps sing \"So Long, Farewell\" (reprise), leaving the stage in small groups. Max then announces the runners-up, stalling as much as possible. When he announces that the first prize goes to the von Trapps and they do not appear, the Nazis start a search. The family hides at the Abbey, and Sister Margaretta tells them that the borders have been closed. Rolf comes upon them and calls his lieutenant, but after seeing Liesl he changes his mind and tells him they aren\\'t there. The Nazis leave, and the von Trapps flee over the Alps as the nuns reprise \"Climb Ev\\'ry Mountain\".\\n \\n \\n The Sound of Music premiered at New Haven\\'s Shubert Theatre where it played an eight-performance tryout in October and November 1959 before another short tryout in Boston.[9] The musical then opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on November 16, 1959, moved to the Mark Hellinger Theatre on November 6, 1962, and closed on June 15, 1963, after 1,443 performances.

It opened at the Grand Riviera Theater, Detroit, on February 27, 1961, and closed November 23, 1963, at the O\\'Keefe Centre, Toronto. Henderson was succeeded by Barbara Meister in June 1962. Theodore Bikel was not satisfied playing the role of the Captain, and Bikel did not like to play the same role over and over again. In his autobiography, he writes: \"I promised myself then that if I could afford it, I would never do a run as long as that again.\"[13] The original Broadway cast album sold three million copies.\\n The musical premiered in London\\'s West End at the Palace Theatre on May 18, 1961, and ran for 2,385 performances.

Michael Jayston played Captain von Trapp, Honor Blackman was the Baroness and June Bronhill played the Mother Abbess. Other notable cast members included Helen Anker, John Bennett and Martina Grant.[16] Despite her misgivings that, at age 49, she was too old to play the role convincingly, Clark opened to unanimous rave reviews and the largest advance sale in the history of British theatre at that time. Maria von Trapp, who attended the opening night performance, described Clark as \"the best\" Maria ever. Clark extended her initial six-month contract to thirteen months. Playing to 101 percent of seating capacity, the show set the highest attendance figure for a single week (October 26–31, 1981) of any British musical production in history (as recorded in The Guinness Book of Theatre).[17][18] It was the first stage production to incorporate the two additional songs (\"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\") that Richard Rodgers composed for the film version.[19] \"My Favorite Things\" had a similar context to the film version, while the short verse \"A Bell is No Bell\" was extended into a full-length song for Maria and the Mother Abbess. \"The Lonely Goatherd\" was set in a new scene at a village fair.\\n The cast recording of this production was the first to be recorded digitally.

The talent show was produced by (and featured) Andrew Lloyd Webber and also featured presenter/comedian Graham Norton and a judging panel of David Ian, John Barrowman and Zoë Tyler.\\n Connie Fisher was selected by public voting as the winner of the show. In early 2007, Fisher suffered from a heavy cold that prevented her from performing for two weeks. To prevent further disruptions, an alternate Maria, Aoife Mulholland, a fellow contestant on How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?, played Maria on Monday evenings and Wednesday matinee performances. Simon Shepherd was originally cast as Captain von Trapp, but after two preview performances he was withdrawn from the production, and Alexander Hanson moved into the role in time for the official opening date along with Lesley Garrett as the Mother Abbess.

Richard Watts Jr. of the New York Post stated that the show had \"strangely gentle charm that is wonderfully endearing. The Sound of Music strives for nothing in the way of smash effects, substituting instead a kind of gracious and unpretentious simplicity.\"[71] The New York World-Telegram and Sun pronounced The Sound of Music \"the loveliest musical imaginable. It places Rodgers and Hammerstein back in top form as melodist and lyricist. The Lindsay-Crouse dialogue is vibrant and amusing in a plot that rises to genuine excitement.\"[71] The New York Journal American\\'s review opined that The Sound of Music is \"the most mature product of the team ... it seemed to me to be the full ripening of these two extraordinary talents\".[71]\\n Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times gave a mixed assessment.

However, he said, the libretto \"has the hackneyed look of the musical theatre replaced with Oklahoma! in 1943. It is disappointing to see the American musical stage succumbing to the clichés of operetta.\"[71] Walter Kerr\\'s review in the New York Herald Tribune was unfavorable: \"Before The Sound of Music is halfway through its promising chores it becomes not only too sweet for words but almost too sweet for music\", stating that the \"evening suffer[s] from little children\".[71]\\n Columbia Masterworks recorded the original Broadway cast album at the Columbia 30th Street Studio in New York City a week after the show\\'s 1959 opening.

According to the cast album database, there are 62 recordings of the score that have been issued over the years.[81]\\n The soundtrack from the 2013 NBC television production starring Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer was released on CD and digital download in December 2013 on the Sony Masterworks label. Also featured on the album are Audra McDonald, Laura Benanti and Christian Borle.[82]', 'Pippi Longstocking (Swedish: Pippi Långstrump) is the fictional main character in a series of children\\'s books by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. Pippi was named by Lindgren\\'s daughter Karin, who asked her mother for a get-well story when she was off school.\\n Pippi is red-haired, freckled, unconventional and superhumanly strong – able to lift her horse one-handed. She is playful and unpredictable. She often makes fun of unreasonable adults, especially if they are pompous and condescending. Her anger comes out in extreme cases, such as when a man mistreats his horse. Pippi, like Peter Pan, does not want to grow up. She is the daughter of a buccaneer captain and has adventure stories to tell about that, too. Her four best friends are her horse and monkey, and the neighbours\\' children, Tommy and Annika.\\n After being rejected by Bonnier Publishers in 1944, Lindgren\\'s first manuscript was accepted by Rabén and Sjögren. The three Pippi chapter books (Pippi Longstocking, Pippi Goes on Board, and Pippi in the South Seas) were published from 1945 to 1948, followed by three short stories and a number of picture book adaptations. They have been translated into 76 languages as of 2018[update][1] and made into several films and television series.\\n Pippi Longstocking is a nine-year-old girl.[2] At the start of the first novel, she moves into Villa Villekulla: the house she shares with her monkey, named Mr. Nilsson, and her horse that is not named in the novels but called Lilla Gubben (Little Old Man) in the movies.[3] Pippi soon befriends the two children living next door, Tommy and Annika Settergren.[4][5] With her suitcase of gold coins, Pippi maintains an independent lifestyle without her parents: her mother died soon after her birth; her father, Captain Ephraim Longstocking, goes missing at sea, ultimately turning up as king of a South Sea island.[6][7][8] Despite periodic attempts by village authorities to make her conform to cultural expectations of what a child\\'s life should be, Pippi happily lives free from social conventions.[9][10] According to Eva-Maria Metcalf, Pippi \"loves her freckles and her tattered clothes; she makes not the slightest attempt to suppress her wild imagination, or to adopt good manners.\"[10] Pippi is literate and has a penchant for storytelling, which often takes the form of tall tales.[11]\\n When discussing Pippi, Astrid Lindgren explained that \"Pippi represents my own childish longing for a person who has power but does not abuse it.\"[12] Although she is the self-proclaimed \"strongest girl in the world\", Pippi often uses nonviolence to solve conflicts, via guile, creativity with facts, and misdirection, such as to protect other children from bullying or excuse her chronic truancy.[13][14] Pippi has been variously described by literary critics as \"warm-hearted\",[9] compassionate,[15] kind,[16] clever,[7] generous,[9][17] playful,[18] and witty to the point of besting adult characters in conversation.[9] Laura Hoffeld wrote that while Pippi\\'s \"naturalness entails selfishness, ignorance, and a marked propensity to lie\", the character \"is simultaneously generous, quick and wise, and true to herself and others.\"[19]\\n The inspiration for her father, Captain Ephraim Longstocking, came from the real life Carl Emil Pettersson, a Swedish sailor who became king of Tabar Island in Papua New Guinea after he was shipwrecked in 1904. He married the local king\\'s daughter, and they had nine children.[8]\\n Biographer Jens Andersen locates a range of influences and inspiration for Pippi not only within educational theories of the 1930s, such as those of A. S. Neill and Bertrand Russell, but also contemporary films and comics that featured \"preternaturally strong characters\" (e.g. Superman and Tarzan).[20] Literary inspiration for the character can be found in Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland, E. T. A. Hoffmann\\'s The Strange Child, Anne of Green Gables, and Daddy Long Legs in addition to myths, fairytales, and legends.[20] Andersen argues that the \"misanthropic, emotionally stunted age\" of the Second World War, during which Lindgren was developing the character, provided the most influence: the original version of Pippi, according to Andersen, \"was a cheerful pacifist whose answer to the brutality and evil of war was goodness, generosity, and good humor.\"[21]\\n Pippi originates from bedside stories told for Lindgren\\'s daughter, Karin. In the winter of 1941, Karin had come down with an illness and was confined to her sickbed; inspired by Karin\\'s request to tell her stories about Pippi Longstocking—a name Karin had created on the spot[22]—Lindgren improvised stories about an \"anything-but-pious\" girl with \"boundless energy.\"[23] As a child, Karin related more to Annika and Tommy, rather than Pippi, who she felt was very different from her personality.[24] Pippi became a staple within the household, with Karin\\'s friends and cousins also enjoying her adventures.[23] In April 1944, while recovering from a twisted ankle, Lindgren wrote her stories about Pippi in shorthand, a method she used throughout her writing career; a copy of the clean manuscript was turned into a homemade book for Karin and given to her on May 21, while another was posted to publisher Bonnier Förlag, where it was rejected in September on the grounds of being \"too advanced.\"[25]\\n After her critical success with her debut children\\'s novel The Confidences of Britt-Mari (1944),[26] Lindgren sent the manuscript for Pippi Longstocking to her editor at Rabén and Sjögren, the children\\'s librarian and critic Elsa Olenius, in May 1945. Olenius advised her to revise some of the \"graphic\" elements, such as a full chamber pot being used as a fire extinguisher, and then to enter it into the upcoming competition at Rabén and Sjögren, which was for books targeted at children between the ages of six and ten.[27] Critic Ulla Lundqvist estimates that a third of the manuscript was altered, with some changes made to improve its prose and readability, and others done to the character of Pippi, who according to Lundqvist \"acquire[d] a new modesty and tenderness, and also a slight touch of melancholy,\" as well as \"less intricate\" dialogue.[4] Pippi Longstocking placed first and was subsequently published in November 1945 with illustrations by Ingrid Vang Nyman.[28] Two more books followed: Pippi Goes on Board (1946) and Pippi in the South Seas (1948).[29] Three picture books were also produced: Pippi\\'s After Christmas Party (1950), Pippi on the Run (1971), and Pippi Longstocking in the Park (2001).[30]\\n Pippi in the original Swedish language books says her full name is Pippilotta Viktualia Rullgardina Krusmynta Efraimsdotter Långstrump. Although her surname Långstrump – literally long stocking – translates easily into other languages, her personal names are less easily translated,[31] and one of them is a patronymic, Efraimsdotter, which is unfamiliar to many cultures. English language books and films about Pippi have given her name in the following forms:\\n In 2005, UNESCO published lists of the most widely translated books. In regard to children\\'s literature, Pippi Longstocking was listed as the fifth most widely translated work with versions in 70 different languages.[36][37] As of 2017, Lindgren\\'s works had been translated into 100 languages.[38] Here are the character\\'s names in some languages other than English.\\n Pippi Longstocking quickly became popular in Sweden upon publication, and by the end of the 1940s, 300,000 copies had been sold, saving Rabén and Sjögren from impending financial ruin.[42] This was partially due to Olenius\\'s marketing: she ensured that the book was frequently read to a radio audience, as well as helping to put on a popular adaptation of the book at her children\\'s theatre at Medborgarhuset, Stockholm, in March 1946, for which only a library card was required for admission.[43] This performance also toured other Swedish cities, including Norrköping, Göteborg, and Eskilstuna.[43] Another factor in the book\\'s success was two positive reviews by the influential Swedish critics of children\\'s culture, Eva von Zweigbergk and Greta Bolin, writing for Dagens Nyheter and Svenska Dagbladet, respectively; they  praised the main character as \"a liberatory force.\"[44] Zweigbergk wrote that Pippi could provide an outlet for regular children who do not have the considerable freedom she possesses, with which Bolin agreed, remarking that Pippi\\'s humor and antics would also appeal to adults for the same reason.[45]\\n Subsequent reviews of Pippi Longstocking echoed the general opinions of von Zweigbergk and Bolin towards the book, until John Landquist\\'s criticism in an August 1946 piece published in Aftonbladet, titled \"BAD AND PRIZEWINNING.\"[46] Landquist, who worked as a professor at Lund University, argued that the book was badly done, harmful to children, and that Pippi herself was mentally disturbed.[46][47] Further criticism of Pippi\\'s supposedly \"unnatural\" and harmful behavior followed in an article in the teachers\\' magazine Folkskollärarnas Tidning and in readers\\' letters to magazines.[46][48] This debate over Pippi\\'s performance of childhood colored the reviews of the sequel Pippi Goes On Board (October 1946), some of which responded to Landquist\\'s argument within the review itself.[46][48] Regardless, Pippi continued to maintain her popularity and was featured in a range of merchandising, adaptations, and advertising.[49]\\n In 1950, Pippi Longstocking was translated into American English by Viking Books,[nb 1] featuring Louis Glanzman\\'s artwork.[50] It did not become a bestseller, although sales did eventually improve after the initial release; more than five million copies had been sold by 2000.[51] Pippi was positively received by American reviewers, who did not find her behavior \"subversive\" or problematic, but rather \"harmless\" and entertaining.[52] Eva-Maria Metcalf has argued that Pippi was subject to a \"double distancing\" as both a foreign character and one believed to be nonsensical, thus minimizing her potentially subversive actions that had stirred the minor controversy earlier in Sweden.[53] As a result of Pippi and Lindgren\\'s growing recognition in the United States, Pippi\\'s behavior in later books became more critically scrutinized by literary critics, some of whom were less sure of the \"hilarious nonsensical behavior, the goodness of her heart, and the freedom of her spirit\" that had been lauded in earlier reviews.[54] Reviewers of Pippi in the South Seas in The Horn Book Magazine and The Saturday Review found Pippi to be less charming than in earlier books, with The Saturday Review describing her as \"noisy and rude and unfunny.\"[55]\\n An influential television adaptation of Pippi Longstocking debuted on 8 February 1969 in Sweden, and was broadcast for thirteen weeks, during which it acquired a considerable following.[56] It was directed by Olle Hellbom, who later directed other adaptations of Lindgren\\'s works.[57] Inger Nilsson starred as Pippi, and upon the broadcast of the television series, she became a celebrity along with her co-stars Pär Sundberg and Maria Persson, who played Tommy and Annika respectively.[56] In this adaptation Pippi\\'s horse that is unnamed in the novels was called Lilla Gubben (Little Old Man).[3] As a result of Lindgren\\'s considerable unhappiness with the lesser-known Swedish film adaptation of Pippi Longstocking (1949), she wrote the screenplay for the television adaptation, which stuck more closely to the narrative of the books than the film had.[58] Scholar Christine Anne Holmlund briefly discussed the difference she found between the two iterations of Pippi, namely that Viveca Serlachius\\'s portrayal of Pippi sometimes took on middle-class sensibilities in a way that other iterations of Pippi had not, for example, purchasing a piano in one scene only to show it off in Villa Villakula. In contrast, the Pippi of Hellbom\\'s television series and subsequent tie-in 1970 films, Pippi in the South Seas and Pippi on the Run,[59][60] is an \"abnormal, even otherworldly,\" periodically gender-defying bohemian reminiscent of Swedish hippies.[61] Holmlund argued that both Gunvall and Hellbom\\'s adaptations depict her as a \"lovably eccentric girl.\"[62]\\n In the twenty-first century, Pippi has continued to maintain her popularity, often placing on lists of favorite characters from children\\'s literature or feminist characters.[63][64][65] She is regarded as the most well-known of Lindgren\\'s creations,[62] and appears as a character in Astrid Lindgren\\'s World, a theme park in Vimmerby, Sweden, dedicated to Lindgren\\'s works,[66] and on the obverse of the Swedish 20 kronor note, as issued by Riksbank.[67] Additionally, Pika\\'s Festival, a children\\'s festival in Slovenia, borrows its name from her.[68] Pippi has also inspired other literary creations: for his character Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium series, Stieg Larsson was inspired by his idea of what Pippi might have been like as an adult.[69] Pippi has continued to remain popular with critics, who often cite her freedom as part of her appeal. The Independent\\'s Paul Binding described her as \"not simply a girl boldly doing boys\\' things,\" but rather \"[i]n her panache and inventiveness she appeals to the longings, the secret psychic demands of girls and boys, and indeed has happily united them in readership all over the world.\"[70] Susanna Forest of The Telegraph called Pippi \"still outrageous and contemporary\" and \"the ultimate imaginary friend to run along rooftops and beat up the bad guys.\"[71] In 100 Best Books for Children, Anita Silvey praised the character as \"the perfect fantasy heroine — one who lives without supervision but with endless money to execute her schemes.\"[66]\\n Pippi has been subject to censorship in translations. A censored edition of Pippi Longstocking appeared in France, with changes made to her character to make her \"a fine young lady\" instead of \"a strange, maladjusted child.\"[72] Additionally, the publisher, Hachette, thought that Pippi\\'s ability to lift a horse would seem unrealistic to French child readers, and thus changed the horse to a pony.[73] In response to this change, Lindgren requested that the publisher give her a photo of a real French girl lifting a pony, as that child would have a \"secure\" weightlifting career.[74] Sara Van den Bossche has hypothesized that the lack of controversy as a result of the censorship might be why Pippi Longstocking went mainly unremarked upon in France, whereas in Germany and Sweden, the book quickly became accepted within the countries\\' respective children\\'s literature canon, even as it stirred controversy over its \"anti-authoritarian tendencies.\"[72][clarification needed] In 1995, an uncensored version of Pippi Longstocking was released in France, which \"shook\" French readers, although the book did not reach the cultural status as it had in Germany and Sweden.[75][clarification needed]\\n The character has also centered in debates about how to handle potentially offensive racial language in children\\'s literature. In 2014, the Swedish public broadcaster SVT edited the 1969 television adaptation of Pippi Longstocking with the approval of Astrid Lindgren\\'s heirs: the first edit removed Pippi\\'s reference to her father as \"King of the Negroes,\" a term now offensive in Sweden;[nb 2] and the second eliminated Pippi slanting her eyes, although it kept her pretending to sing in \"Chinese\".[77] These changes received a backlash: of the first 25,000 Swedish readers polled by the Aftonbladet on Facebook, eighty-one percent disagreed with the idea of removing outdated racial language and notions from Pippi Longstocking, and the columnist Erik Helmerson of Dagens Nyheter labelled the changes as censorship.[77] One of Lindgren\\'s grandchildren, Nils Nyman, defended the edits, arguing that to not do so might have diluted Pippi\\'s message of female empowerment.[77]\\n The three main Pippi Longstocking books were published first in Swedish and later in English:\\n There are also a number of additional Pippi stories, some just in Swedish, others in both Swedish and English:\\n Other books in Swedish include:[92]', \"Pete's Dragon is the title of two Disney live-action films:\", 'Ferdinand is a Germanic name composed of  the  elements farð \"journey, travel\", Proto-Germanic *farthi, abstract noun from root *far- \"to fare, travel\" (PIE *par, \"to lead, pass over\"), and nanth \"courage\" or  nand \"ready, prepared\" related to Old High German nendan \"to risk, venture.\"\\n The name was adopted in Romance languages from its use in the Visigothic Kingdom. It is reconstructed as either Gothic Ferdinanths or Frithunanths. It became popular in German-speaking Europe only from the 16th century, with Habsburg rule over Spain. Variants of the name include Fernán, Fernando, Hernando, and Hernán in Spanish, Ferran in Catalan, and Fernando and Fernão in Portuguese. The French forms are Ferrand, Fernand, and Fernandel, and it is Ferdinando and Fernando in Italian. In Hungarian both Ferdinánd and Nándor are used equally. The Dutch forms are Ferdinand and Ferry.\\n There are numerous short forms in many languages, such as the Finnish Veeti.\\n There is a feminine Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian form, Fernanda.', 'The Little Prince (French: Le Petit Prince, pronounced [lə p(ə)ti pʁɛ̃s]) is a novella written and illustrated by French writer and military pilot Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It was first published in English and French in the United States by Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943 and was published posthumously in France following liberation; Saint-Exupéry\\'s works had been banned by the Vichy Regime. The story follows a young prince who visits various planets, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style as a children\\'s book, The Little Prince makes observations about life, adults, and human nature.[9]\\n The Little Prince became Saint-Exupéry\\'s most successful work, selling an estimated 140 million copies worldwide, which makes it one of the best-selling in history.[10][11][12][Note 2][14] The book has been translated into over 505 different languages and dialects worldwide, being the second most translated work ever published, trailing only the Bible.[15][16][17] The Little Prince has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including audio recordings, radio plays, live stage, film, television, ballet, and opera.[16][18]\\n As a test to determine if grownups are as enlightened as a child, the narrator shows them a picture depicting a boa constrictor that has eaten an elephant. The adults always reply that the picture depicts a hat, and so he knows to only talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than the fanciful.\\n The narrator becomes an aircraft pilot, and one day, his plane crashes in the Sahara desert, far from civilization. The narrator must fix his air plane before his supply of water runs out. Here, he is greeted by a young boy nicknamed \"the little prince.\"\\n The prince asks the narrator to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him the picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator\\'s surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator draws a crate, claiming the sheep is inside. This turns out to be the exact drawing the prince wanted.\\n Over the course of days, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the prince recounts his life story. He used to live on a house-sized asteroid known as \"B 612\" on Earth. The asteroid has three minuscule volcanoes (two active, and one dormant or extinct) and various plants.\\n The prince used to clean the volcanoes and weed unwanted seeds and sprigs that infested his soil, pulling out baobab trees that were constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. The prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.\\n The prince met a rose that grew on the asteroid. The rose exaggerated ailments to have the prince care for her. The prince made a screen and glass globe to protect her from the cold and wind, watered her, and kept the caterpillars off.\\n Despite falling in love with the rose, the prince also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him and resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon saying their goodbyes, the rose apologised for failing to show that she loved him. She wished him well and turned down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she would protect herself. The prince laments that he did not understand how to love his rose while being with her.\\n The prince has since visited six other planets, each of which was inhabited by one adult. They include:\\n Since the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished that. The prince next met a flower, who said she had only seen a few men in that part of the world, and they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of someone boring who only repeats words.\\n The prince encountered a row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his rose was unique and thinking she had lied about being unique. He began to feel that he was not a great prince, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower he now thought of as common. He started weeping, until a fox came along.\\n The fox desired to be tamed and taught the prince how to tame him. By being tamed, something goes from being ordinary and just like all the others to being special and unique.\\n From the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed special because she was the object of the prince\\'s love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the other roses. Upon their departing, the fox says that important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.\\n The prince then met two people from Earth:\\n Eight days after the plane crash, the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince becomes morose and longs to return home and see his flower.\\n The prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, worrying that she has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids a farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realising what will happen, refuses to leave the prince\\'s side. The prince says that the narrator only need look at the stars to think of the prince\\'s laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away and allows the snake to bite him, falling down.\\n The next morning, the narrator cannot find the prince\\'s body. Managing to repair his aeroplane, he leaves the desert. The narrator requests to be contacted by anyone in that area encountering a boy like the prince.\\n The story of The Little Prince is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, \"a memorial to the prince—not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.\"[19] The Little Prince was created when Saint-Exupéry was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"[14] According to one analysis, \"the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements.... You can\\'t ride a flock of birds to another planet... The fantasy of the Little Prince works because the logic of the story is based on the imagination of children, rather than the strict realism of adults.\"[20]\\n An exquisite literary perfectionist, akin to the 19th century French poet Stéphane Mallarmé,[21] Saint-Exupéry produced draft pages \"covered with fine lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut[ing] for a page...\"[22] He worked \"long hours with great concentration.\" According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes.[23] Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author\\'s style: \"Behind Saint-Exupéry\\'s quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts by as much as two-thirds.\"[24] The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting at about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exupéry related to his American English teacher, Adèle Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt \"free\" and able to concentrate, \"writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy\", until he instantaneously dozed off.[22] He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exupéry stated it was the only way he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.[25]\\n A native speaker of French, Saint-Exupéry was never able to achieve anything more than haltingly poor English. Adèle Breaux, his young Northport English tutor to whom he later dedicated a writing (\"For Miss Adèle Breaux, who so gently guided me in the mysteries of the English language\"), related her experiences with her famous student as Saint-Exupéry in America, 1942–1943: A Memoir, published in 1971.[26]\\n \"Saint-Exupéry\\'s prodigious writings and studies of literature sometimes gripped him, and on occasion he continued his readings of literary works until moments before take-off on solitary military reconnaissance flights, as he was adept at both reading and writing while flying. Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his ground crew would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something \\'very hard\\'. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exupéry frequently flew with a lined carnet (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming \\'enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable\\'.\"[27][28]\\n In The Little Prince, its narrator, the pilot, talks of being stranded in the desert beside his crashed aircraft. The account clearly drew on Saint-Exupéry\\'s own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir Wind, Sand and Stars (original French: Terre des hommes).[9]\\n On 30 December 1935, at 2.45am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exupéry, along with his copilot-navigator André Prévot, crashed in the Sahara desert.[29] They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight in a then-popular type of air race called a raid, that had a prize of 150,000\\xa0francs.[30] Their plane was a Caudron C-630 Simoun,[Note 3] and the crash site is thought to have been near to the Wadi Natrun valley, close to the Nile Delta.[31]\\n Both miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat.[32] Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day\\'s worth of liquid. They both began to see mirages, which were quickly followed by more vivid hallucinations. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exupéry\\'s and Prévot\\'s lives.[30]\\n In the novella, the fox, believed to be modelled after the author\\'s intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves.[33] The novella\\'s iconic phrase, \"One sees clearly only with the heart\" is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.\\n The fearsome, grasping baobab trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent Nazism attempting to destroy the planet.[33] The little prince\\'s reassurance to the pilot that the prince\\'s body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine\\'s dying younger brother François, who told the author, from his deathbed: \"Don\\'t worry. I\\'m all right. I can\\'t help it. It\\'s my body\".[34]\\n Many researchers believe that the prince\\'s kindhearted, but petulant and vain, Rose was inspired by Saint-Exupéry\\'s Salvadoran wife Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry,[33][35] with the small home planet being inspired by El Salvador where he crashed and stayed to recover while being within view of 3 volcanoes, one of which was Ilamatepec, also known as The Santa Ana Volcano.[36] Despite a tumultuous marriage, Saint-Exupéry kept Consuelo close to his heart and portrayed her as the prince\\'s rose, whom he tenderly protects with a wind screen and places under a glass dome on his tiny planet. Saint-Exupéry\\'s infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.[9]\\n This interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was \"the muse to whom Saint-Exupéry poured out his soul in copious letters ... Consuelo was the rose in The Little Prince. \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words\", says the prince. \"She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses.\"[24]\\n Saint-Exupéry probably has drawn inspiration for the prince\\'s character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him le Roi-Soleil (\"the Sun King\") because of his golden curly hair.[citation needed] The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in Quebec City in 1942, Thomas De Koninck, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck.[37][38][39] Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whom he met during an overnight stay at their Long Island home in 1939.[40][41][Note 4]\\n Some have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and \"believes in a life after death\", subsequently returning to his personal heaven.[42] When Life photojournalist John Phillips questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exupéry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: \"I asked him who he was\", he replied. \"I\\'m the Little Prince\" was the reply.[43]\\n One of Saint-Exupéry\\'s earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for Paris-Soir, the author described traveling from France to the Soviet Union by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exupéry incorporated into various philosophical writings:[44]\\n I sat down [facing a sleeping] couple. Between the man and the woman a child had hollowed himself out a place and fallen asleep. He turned in his slumber, and in the dim lamplight I saw his face. What an adorable face! A golden fruit had been born of these two peasants..... This is a musician\\'s face, I told myself. This is the child Mozart. This is a life full of beautiful promise. Little princes in legends are not different from this. Protected, sheltered, cultivated, what could not this child become? When by mutation a new rose is born in a garden, all gardeners rejoice. They isolate the rose, tend it, foster it. But there is no gardener for men. This little Mozart will be shaped like the rest by the common stamping machine.... This little Mozart is condemned. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, a laureate of several of France\\'s highest literary awards and a successful pioneering aviator prior to the war, Saint-Exupéry initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron as a reserve military pilot in the Armée de l\\'Air (French Air Force).[9] After France\\'s defeat in 1940 and its armistice with Germany, he and Consuelo fled Occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exupéry first arriving by himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against Nazi Germany and the Axis forces, and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the French Resistance. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.[45]\\n An earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in The Little Prince.\\n He wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on the author\\'s neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent French Gaullist and Vichy France.[46] Saint-Exupéry\\'s American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: \"He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.\"[22] However, the period was to be both a \"dark but productive time\" during which he created three important works.[47]\\n Between January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exupérys lived in two penthouse apartments on Central Park South,[48] then, at the Delamater-Bevin Mansion in Asharoken, Long Island, and still later, a rented brownstone on Beekman Place, again in New York City.[49][50]\\n The couple also stayed in Quebec for five weeks during the late spring of 1942, where they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exupérys resided.[51][52][53][54] During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exupéry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh.[40][41]\\n After returning to the US from his Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exupéry was pressed to work on a children\\'s book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exupéry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children\\'s story would help.[55][Note 5] The author wrote and illustrated The Little Prince at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.[50][51][51]\\n Although the book was started in his Central Park South penthouse, Saint-Exupéry soon found New York City\\'s noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations. After spending some time at an unsuitable clapboard country house in Westport, Connecticut,[56] they found Bevin House, a 22-room mansion in Asharoken that overlooked Long Island Sound. The author-aviator initially complained, \"I wanted a hut, and it\\'s the Palace of Versailles.\"[45] As the weeks wore on, the author became invested in his project and the home would become \"a haven for writing, the best place I have ever had anywhere in my life.\"[57] He devoted himself to the book on mostly midnight shifts,[22] usually starting at about 11\\xa0pm, fueled by helpings of scrambled eggs on English muffins, gin and tonics, Coca-Colas, cigarettes and numerous visits by friends and expatriates who dropped in to see their famous countryman. One of the visitors was his wife\\'s Swiss writer paramour Denis de Rougemont, who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air.[45][50] De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, The Tale of the Rose, as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exupéry.\\n While the author\\'s personal life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan Library and Museum which had obtained Saint-Exupéry\\'s original manuscript in 1968, stated: \"On the one hand, he had a clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren\\'t quite right\", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length.[58] The story, the curator added, was created when he was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"[14]\\n The large white Second French Empire-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table.[22] It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book, where the prince visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset \"is move your chair a few steps.\"[45][50][Note 6]\\n The original 140-page autograph manuscript of The Little Prince, along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author\\'s close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now The Morgan Library & Museum) in Manhattan, New York City.[11][59][60] It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work.[61] The manuscript\\'s pages include large amounts of the author\\'s prose that was struck-through and therefore not published as part of the first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several watercolour illustrations by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella\\'s publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author\\'s birth, with major exhibitions of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\\'s literary works.[33][62] Physically, the manuscript\\'s onion skin media has become brittle and subject to damage. Saint-Exupéry\\'s handwriting is described as being doctor-like, verging on indecipherable.[63]\\n The story\\'s keynote aphorism, On ne voit bien qu\\'avec le cœur. L\\'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye\") was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing. Saint-Exupéry also used a Dictaphone recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist.[22][59] His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00\\xa0a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.[22]\\n Many pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story\\'s theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the Rockefeller Center and Long Island. Other deleted pages described the prince\\'s vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince\\'s planetoid. Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls. Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exupéry\\'s shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page epilogue lamenting \"On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...\", with the story\\'s pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: \"he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.\" The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella\\'s printing.[59]\\n In April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text.[10][64] In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an \"ambassador of the human spirit\".[10][64] The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: \"I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means \\'gargling\\'\\xa0\", he says. Saint-Exupéry\\'s text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be \"guerre\" (or \"war\"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as \\'to gargle\\' in French is an informal reference to \\'honour\\', which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.[64][65]\\n Saint-Exupéry met Léon Werth (1878–1955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery\\'s closest friend outside of his Aeropostale associates. Werth was an anarchist, a leftist Bolshevik supporter of Jewish descent, twenty-two years older than Saint-Exupéry.\\n \\nSaint-Exupéry dedicated two books to him, Lettre à un otage\\xa0[fr] (Letter to a Hostage) and Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing The Little Prince, Saint-Exupéry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in Saint-Amour, his village in the Jura, a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was \"alone, cold and hungry\", a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exupéry dedicates the book to him:[66] To Leon Werth\\n I ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up. I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world. I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children. I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs to be comforted. If all these excuses are not enough then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was. All grown-ups were children first. (But few of them remember it.) So I correct my dedication:\\n To Leon Werth,\\n \\nWhen he was a little boy Saint-Exupéry\\'s aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend\\'s disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of The Little Prince, in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exupéry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him.[67] At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exupéry did not live to see, Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exupéry) isn\\'t entirely peace.\" Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend\\'s death, when Saint-Exupéry\\'s French publisher, Gallimard, sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.\\n All of the novella\\'s simple but elegant watercolour illustrations, which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exupéry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist – which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella\\'s introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used as his medium of choice.[50] As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew.[Note 7] Two or three original Little Prince drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker Joseph Cornell.[68] One rare original Little Prince watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.[69][70]\\n An unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exupéry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper.[43][45] Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb\\'s Keep On Truckin\\' of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend, he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher\\'s office.[43] Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as \"...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exupéry came to think of as \"the little prince\", and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.\"[56] His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\".[45] Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. One \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince\\'s arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry\\'s editing process.[14]\\n To mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of The Little Prince\\'s publication, the Morgan Library and Museum mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exupéry\\'s draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a Free French Air Force pilot.[33][62][71] Hamilton\\'s black poodle, Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince\\'s sheep, with a Raggedy Ann type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince.[61] Additionally, a pet boxer, Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story\\'s desert fox and its tiger.[47] A museum representative stated that the novella\\'s final drawings were lost.[33]\\n Seven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum\\'s exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince\\'s home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story\\'s narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a \\'literalness\\' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library\\'s staff.[33] According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"[t]he image evokes Saint-Exupéry\\'s own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince.\"[14] Another reviewer noted that the author \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exupéry chose in every case to obfuscate.\"[72] Not a single drawing of the story\\'s narrator–pilot survived the author\\'s editing process; \"he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story\".[14]\\n In 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exupéry painted for Le Petit Prince deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author\\'s own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exupéry\\'s watercolour illustrations contained the planets Saturn and Jupiter, plus the star Aldebaran, arranged as an isosceles triangle, a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000.[73] Saint-Exupéry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master celestial navigator, a vocation he had studied at Salon-de-Provence with the Armée de l\\'Air (French Air Force).\\n Stacy Schiff, one of Saint-Exupéry\\'s principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, \"rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and his Little Prince\", and remarking of their dual fates, \"the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky\".[74] Another noted that the novella\\'s mystique was \"enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.\"[75]\\n Only weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife\\'s pleadings and before Saint-Exupéry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the Free French Forces. He would remain immensely proud of The Little Prince, and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.[74]\\n As part of a 32-ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying.[Note 8] He had previously escaped death by the barest of margins a number of times, but was then lost in action during a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of Corsica to the continent in preparation for the Allied invasion of occupied France, only three weeks before the Liberation of Paris.[45][Note 9]\\n Many of the book\\'s initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable\\'s multi-layered story line and its morals,[9] perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France\\'s leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children\\'s nor adults\\' literature classification. The New York Times reviewer wrote shortly before its publication \"What makes a good children\\'s book? ... The Little Prince, which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10. [It] may very well be a book on the order of Gulliver\\'s Travels, something that exists on two levels\"; \"Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10-year olds?\" Notwithstanding the story\\'s duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still \"capture the imagination of any child.\"[78] Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, Reynal & Hitchcock promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned \"it\\'s the new book by Saint-Exupéry\", adding to its dustcover \"There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.\"[59]\\n Others were not shy in offering their praise. Austin Stevens, also of The New York Times, stated that the story possessed \"...large portions of the Saint-Exupéry philosophy and poetic spirit. In a way it\\'s a sort of credo.\"[56] P.L. Travers, author of the Mary Poppins series of children books, wrote in a New York Herald Tribune review: \"The Little Prince will shine upon children with a sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there until the time comes for them to comprehend it.\"[59][79]\\n British journalist Neil Clark, in The American Conservative in 2009, offered an expansive view of Saint-Exupéry\\'s overall work by commenting that it provides a \"…bird\\'s eye view of humanity [and] contains some of the most profound observations on the human condition ever written\", and that the author\\'s novella \"doesn\\'t merely express his contempt for selfishness and materialism [but] shows how life should be lived.\"[80]\\n The book enjoyed modest initial success, residing on The New York Times Best Seller list for only two weeks,[63] as opposed to his earlier 1939 English translation, Wind, Sand and Stars which remained on the same list for nearly five months.[43] As a cultural icon, the novella regularly draws new readers and reviewers, selling almost two million copies annually and also spawning numerous adaptations. Modern-day references to The Little Prince include one from The New York Times that describes it as \"abstract\" and \"fabulistic\".[62]\\n As of April 2017,[81] The Little Prince became the world\\'s most translated non-religious book (into 300 languages) together with Italian novel The Adventures of Pinocchio.\\n Katherine Woods (1886–1968)[82] produced the first English translation of 1943, which was later joined by several other English translations. Her translation contained some errors.[83][84] Mistranslations aside, one reviewer noted that Wood\\'s almost \"poetic\" English translation has long been admired by many Little Prince lovers, who have spanned generations (it stayed in print until 2001), as her work maintains Saint-Exupéry\\'s story-telling spirit and charm, if not its literal accuracy.[72] As of 2019[update] at least seven additional English translations have been published:[85]\\n The Little Prince was also translated by Bonnie Greer for a BBC radio adaptation in 1999.\\n Each translation approaches the essence of the original with an individual style and focus.[88][89]\\n Le Petit Prince is often used as a beginner\\'s book for French-language students, and several bilingual and trilingual translations have been published. As of 2017, it has been translated into more than 300 languages and dialects, including Sardinian,[90] the constructed international languages of Esperanto and Klingon, and the Congolese language Alur, as well as being printed in Braille for blind readers. It is also often used as an introduction into endangered varieties with very few speakers like Maya (2001), Aromanian (2006), or Banat Bulgarian (2017). It is one of the few modern books to have been translated into Latin, as Regulus, vel Pueri soli sapiunt[91][92] in 1961 by Auguste Haury (1910–2002) and as Regulus in 2010 by Alexander Winkler. A translation of the book was published as U\\'cc priinsâž in Skolt Sámi translated by Skolt Sámi author Kati-Claudia Fofonoff in 2000, a language spoken in Sápmi. Which, at the time, was spoken by less than 500 people making it the smallest language with a translation of Le Petit Prince.  In 2005, the book was also translated into Toba Qom, an indigenous language of northern Argentina, as So Shiyaxauolec Nta\\'a. It was the first book translated into that language since the New Testament. It was also translated to a northern Italian dialect, Vogherese. Anthropologist Florence Tola, commenting on the suitability of the work for Toban translation, said there is \"nothing strange [when] the Little Prince speaks with a snake or a fox and travels among the stars, it fits perfectly into the Toba mythology\".[93]\\n Linguists have compared the many translations and even editions of the same translation for style, composition, titles, wordings and genealogy. As an example: as of 2011 there are approximately 47 translated editions of The Little Prince in Korean,[Note 10] and there are also about 50 different translated editions in Chinese (produced in both mainland China and Taiwan). Many of them are titled Prince From a Star, while others carry the book title that is a direct translation of The Little Prince.[95] By studying the use of word phrasings, nouns, mistranslations and other content in newer editions, linguists can identify the source material for each version: whether it was derived from the original French typescript, or from its first translation into English by Katherine Woods, or from a number of adapted sources.[72][96]\\n The first edition to be published in France, Saint-Exupéry\\'s birthplace, was printed by his regular publisher in that country, Gallimard, only after[8] the German occupation of France ended.[97][Note 11] Prior to France\\'s liberation new printings of Saint-Exupéry\\'s works were made available only by means of secret print runs,[99][100] such as that of February 1943 when 1,000 copies of an underground version of his best seller Pilote de guerre, describing the German invasion of France, were covertly printed in Lyon.[101]\\n Commemorating the novella\\'s 70th anniversary of publication, in conjunction with the 2014 Morgan Exhibition, Éditions Gallimard released a complete facsimile edition of Saint-Exupéry\\'s original handwritten manuscript entitled Le Manuscrit du Petit Prince d\\'Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: Facsimilé et Transcription, edited by Alban Cerisier and Delphine Lacroix. The book in its final form has also been republished in 70th anniversary editions by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (in English) and by Gallimard (in French).[61]\\n A Portuguese translation of the novella in 2007, edited by Eidouro Gráfica e Editora Ltda and presented at the XIII Biannual Book Fair of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, holds the Guinness World Record for world\\'s largest book published.[102] The impressive tome measures 2.01 m (6\\xa0ft 7 in) high and 3.08 m (10\\xa0ft 1 in) wide when open, containing 128 pages.\\n It has been translated into minority languages, such as the Irish language, by Éabhloid publishers in 2015.\\n After being translated by Bonifacio del Carril, The Little Prince was first published in Spanish as El principito in September 1951 by the Argentine publisher Emecé Editores.[103][104] Other Spanish editions have also been created; in 1956 the Mexican publisher Diana released its first edition of the book, El pequeño príncipe, a Spanish translation by José María Francés.[8] Another edition of the work was produced in Spain in 1964 and, four years later, in 1968, editions were also produced in Colombia and Cuba, with translation by Luis Fernández in 1961. Chile had its first translation in 1981; Peru in February 1985; Venezuela in 1986, and Uruguay in 1990.[103][105][106]\\nThe book is among the few books in the Castilian cant Gacería[107] (as El pitoche engrullón) or the Madrid slang Cheli[108] (as El chaval principeras).\\n The Little Prince has an adaptation for the inhabitants of Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol, covering for a large variety of the Bavarian language. The book was adapted by Johannes Limmer and published in 2019. It is called Da gloane Prinz and contains the original pictures of Saint-Exupéry.[109]\\n The Little Prince is one of the most popular and beloved foreign works of literature in China. It is reported that there are more than 70 Chinese translations of the novella.[110] According to the official website of the Succession Antoine de Saint-Exupéry-d\\'Agay, the version translated by Li Jihong, which was published in January 2013, sold over two million copies in less than four years.[111] Cheng Li-chun published a translation in Taiwan in May 2022.[112]\\n Due to Saint-Exupéry\\'s wartime death, his estate received the civil code designation Mort pour la France (English: Died for France), which was applied by the French government in 1948. Amongst the law\\'s provisions is an increase of 30 years in the duration of copyright;[113] thus most of Saint-Exupéry\\'s creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years.[114][75]\\n The book will remain under copyright in the US until 2039[115][116] and will remain in copyright in France until 2033 or 2045.[117][118]\\n The wide appeal of Saint-Exupéry\\'s novella has led to it being adapted into numerous forms over the decades. Additionally, the title character himself has been adapted in a number of promotional roles, including as a symbol of environmental protection, by the Toshiba Group.[119] He has also been portrayed as a \"virtual ambassador\" in a campaign against smoking, employed by the Veolia Energy Services Group,[119] and his name was used as an episode title in the TV series Lost.\\n The multi-layered fable, styled as a children\\'s story with its philosophical elements of irony and paradox directed towards adults, allowed The Little Prince to be transferred into various other art forms and media, including:\\n In 1997, Jean-Pierre Davidts wrote what could be considered a sequel to The Little Prince, entitled Le petit prince retrouvé (The Little Prince Returns).[125] In this version, the shipwrecked narrator encounters the little prince on a lone island; the prince has returned to seek help against a tiger who threatens his sheep.[126] Another sequel titled The Return of the Little Prince was written by former actress Ysatis de Saint-Simone, niece of Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry.[127]\\n New York City\\'s Morgan Library & Museum mounted three showings of the original manuscript, with its first showing in 1994, on the occasion of the story\\'s 50th anniversary of publication, followed by one celebrating the author\\'s centennial of birth in 2000, with its last and largest exhibition in 2014 honouring the novella\\'s 70th anniversary.\\n The 1994 exhibition displayed the original manuscript, translated by the museum\\'s art historian Ruth Kraemer,[128] as well as a number of the story\\'s watercolours drawn from the Morgan\\'s permanent collection. Also included with the exhibits was a 20-minute video it produced, My Grown-Up Friend, Saint-Exupéry, narrated by actor Macaulay Culkin,[Note 12] along with photos of the author, correspondence to Consuelo, a signed first edition of The Little Prince, and several international editions in other languages.[92]\\n In January 2014, the museum mounted a third, significantly larger, exhibition centered on the novella\\'s creative origins and its history. The major showing of The Little Prince: A New York Story celebrated the story\\'s 70th anniversary.[62] It examined both the novella\\'s New York origins and Saint-Exupéry\\'s creative processes, looking at his story and paintings as they evolved from conceptual germ form into progressively more refined versions and finally into the book\\'s highly polished first edition. It was as if visitors were able to look over his shoulder as he worked, according to curator Christine Nelson. Funding for the 2014 exhibition was provided by several benefactors, including The Florence Gould Foundation, The Caroline Macomber Fund, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Air France and the New York State Council on the Arts.[61]\\n The new, more comprehensive exhibits included 35 watercolor paintings and 25 of the work\\'s original 140 handwritten manuscript pages,[130] with his almost illegible handwriting penciled onto \\'Fidelity\\' watermarked onion skin paper. The autograph manuscript pages included struck-through content that was not published in the novella\\'s first edition. As well, some 43 preparatory pencil drawings that evolved into the story\\'s illustrations accompanied the manuscript, many of them dampened by moisture that rippled its onion skin media.[131][132] One painting depicted the prince floating above Earth wearing a yellow scarf was wrinkled, having been crumpled up and thrown away before being retrieved for preservation.[47] Another drawing loaned from Silvia Hamilton\\'s grandson depicted the diminutive prince observing a sunset on his home asteroid; two other versions of the same drawing were also displayed alongside it allowing visitors to observe the drawing\\'s progressive refinement.[59] The initial working manuscript and sketches, displayed side by side with pages from the novella\\'s first edition, allowed viewers to observe the evolution of Saint-Exupéry\\'s work.\\n Shortly before departing the United States to rejoin his reconnaissance squadron in North Africa in its struggle against Nazi Germany, Saint-Exupéry appeared unexpectedly in military uniform at the door of his intimate friend, Silvia Hamilton. He presented his working manuscript and its preliminary drawings in a \"rumpled paper bag\", placed onto her home\\'s entryway table, offering, \"I\\'d like to give you something splendid, but this is all I have\".[62][71][79][132][133] Several of the manuscript pages bore accidental coffee stains and cigarette scorch marks.[47] The Morgan later acquired the 30,000-word manuscript from Hamilton in 1968, with its pages becoming the centrepieces of its exhibitions on Saint-Exupéry\\'s work. The 2014 exhibition also borrowed artifacts and the author\\'s personal letters from the Saint-Exupéry-d\\'Gay Estate,[Note 13] as well as materials from other private collections, libraries and museums in the United States and France.[134] Running concurrent with its 2014 exhibition, the Morgan held a series of lectures, concerts and film showings, including talks by Saint-Exupéry biographer Stacy Schiff, writer Adam Gopnik, and author Peter Sís on his new work The Pilot and The Little Prince: The Life of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,[133][135]\\n Additional exhibits included photos of Saint-Exupéry by Life photojournalist John Phillips, other photos of the author\\'s New York area homes,[61] an Orson Welles screenplay of the novella the filmmaker attempted to produce as a movie in collaboration with Walt Disney,[43][62][Note 14] as well as one of the few signed copies extant of The Little Prince, gifted to Hamilton\\'s 12-year-old son.[Note 15]\\n French professional wrestler Daniel Dubail was billed as Le Petit Prince.[164]\\nPakistani-British professional wrestler Mohammed Allam was billed as The Little Prince.[165]\\n Since 2020, June 29 is International Little Prince Day. This date was chosen to commemorate the birth of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, which occurred on June 29, 1900. The Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Foundation started the initiative striving to promote the humanist values carried by the book published in 1943. Mark Osborne was one of the first personalities to participate in the Little Prince Day 2020.[166]', 'The Black Cauldron may refer to:', 'Balto (c.\\u20091919 – March 14, 1933) was an Alaskan husky and sled dog belonging to musher and breeder Leonhard Seppala. He achieved fame when he led a team of sled dogs driven by Gunnar Kaasen on the final leg of the 1925 serum run to Nome, in which diphtheria antitoxin was transported from Anchorage, Alaska, to Nenana, Alaska, by train and then to Nome by dog sled to combat an outbreak of the disease. Balto\\'s celebrity status, and that of Kaasen\\'s, resulted in a two-reel motion picture, a statue in Central Park, and a nationwide tour on the vaudeville circuit.\\n A falling out between Seppala and Kaasen resulted in Balto and his teammates being sold under disputed circumstances to a traveling circus operator and ultimately housed in squalor at a dime museum in Los Angeles. When news stories emerged in February 1927 about his poor living conditions, a two-week fundraising effort in Cleveland, Ohio, led to the successful purchase of Balto and his team by the citizenry of Cleveland. Balto lived in ease at the Brookside Zoo until his death on March 14, 1933, at the age of 14; his body was subsequently mounted and displayed in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, where it remains to this day. While the subject of numerous cultural depictions and homages, including a 1995 animated film, Balto\\'s role in the serum run remains controversial as contemporary media coverage focused almost entirely on him over the efforts of the other mushers and dogs—most notably, Seppala and his lead dog Togo—and has more recently undergone historical reappraisals.\\n Little is known about Balto\\'s early years.[1] Balto\\'s birth year is commonly recognized as 1919, in Nome, Alaska, at the kennels of Leonhard Seppala, a native Norwegian, sled dog breeder, musher and competitive racer.[2][3] He was named after Samuel Balto, a Sámi who was part of Fridtjof Nansen\\'s exploration of Greenland in 1888,[4][5] and whom Seppala admired.[a] No birth records were kept for Balto or his litter as his body type did not align with other racing huskies that Seppala was breeding. The only evidence of Balto\\'s birth year came from later interviews with Seppala.[3] With a largely black fur coat, Balto had a small, stocky build, unique for a Siberian husky.[8]\\n Believing Balto to be \"second rate\"[9] and not holding much potential, Seppala neutered him at six months of age.[10] He considered him a \"scrub dog\",[11] unable to run as fast as his other dogs,[6] who were derisively called \"Siberian rats\" by mushers against whom Seppala competed.[12] Seppala claimed in his memoir to have \"given [Balto] every chance\" to ride with his primary sled dog team \"but could not qualify\";[4] thus, Balto was relegated to haul freight and large cargo for short runs and was part of a team that pulled railcars with miners over a disused railroad.[13] Gunnar Kaasen,[b] another native Norwegian and a close family friend of Seppala[10] with 21 years\\' dog sledding experience, came to know Balto through his work at Seppala\\'s mining company.[9][14] Kaasen believed Seppala misjudged Balto\\'s potential and that the dog\\'s short stature could allow him to be more strong and steady.[6]\\n In January 1925, doctors realized that a potentially deadly diphtheria epidemic was poised to sweep through the young people of Nome, Alaska,[15] placing the city under quarantine.[16] Dr. Curtis Welch, the primary physician in Nome, transmitted via Morse code that the town\\'s existing serum, which was over six years old, was being depleted. Additional serum was made available in Anchorage, but the territory\\'s only two usable aircraft had open cockpits and were thus grounded for the winter.[17] After considering all the alternatives, officials decided to have the serum ferried via multiple dog sled teams[18] over the \"Seward-to-Nome Trail\".[19] The serum was transported by train from Anchorage to Nenana, where the first musher embarked as part of a 674-mile (1,085\\xa0km) relay.[20] More than 20 mushers took part, facing a blizzard with −23\\xa0°F (−31\\xa0°C) temperatures and strong winds. Originally projected to arrive in Nome by February 6,[21] the date was moved up several times as the teams repeatedly broke land speed records.[22][23] News coverage of the event, in particular the hazards posed to the dogs and the leaders,[21][24] was relayed worldwide; newspaper headlines read; \"Relief Nears Nome!\",[25] \"Dog Teams in Race with Death in Far North\"[20] and \"Seppalla\\xa0... May Save Diphtheria Victims\".[23]\\n As the serum run progressed, additional teams were recruited[26] as Alaskan governor Scott Cordelle Bone worried about Seppala\\'s team experiencing fatigue.[10] Kaasen was appointed to drive a team of Seppala\\'s dogs originally set aside for company business during the run,[27] with Fox chosen by Seppala as the leader.[8] Kaasen, however, chose Balto to co-lead alongside Fox,[c] a move Seppala later disagreed with as he felt Balto was not worthy to be a lead dog.[28] Balto had been largely untried as a sled dog prior to the run,[19] but Kaasen expressed confidence in Balto\\'s abilities and likely identified with him.[29] The serum package was handed to Kaasen by Charlie Olson in Bluff[30] at 10:00\\xa0p.m. on February 1.[7] The blizzard quickly began to bear down on the team, causing them to become lost and confused. This prompted Kaasen to move Balto to the lead, yelling at him, \"Go home, Balto.\"[31] Balto\\'s ability to pull heavy freight allowed him to steadily navigate the team through the storm;[32] at one point, Balto stopped in front of a patch of ice on the Topkok River that broke underneath him, saving Kaasen\\'s life along with the entire team.[28][33][34] Kaasen suffered frostbite after his sled flipped and the serum package fell into the snow, forcing him to search bare-handed for it.[12][28][35]\\n Kaasen and his team arrived in Point Safety ahead of schedule,[19] but found the last team of the run was not ready and the roadhouse they lodged in was dark.[36] Ed Rohn, the leader of this final team,[37] was asleep at the time under the impression Kaasen had been halted in nearby Solomon,[11] a settlement Kaasen rode past without visibly recognizing due to the poor weather.[36] Kaasen decided not to wake him up and continue on, knowing it would take time for Rohn to prepare and risk putting additional dogs in harm\\'s way.[36] Despite suffering from exposure and exhaustion,[34][38] Kaasen and Balto traveled the remaining 25 miles (40\\xa0km) to Nome, and arrived at Front Street on February 2, 1925, at 5:30\\xa0a.m.[7][d] While frozen solid, all 300,000 units of the antitoxin were intact, and Kaasen handed them over to be thawed for use by midday.[40][41] Four of Kaasen\\'s dogs were partially frozen when they arrived;[42] one newspaper dispatch erroneously stated Balto and the majority of the team died several days later from frozen lungs,[43] and was immediately retracted shortly after publication.[10] Seppala reached Nome two days later and praised Kaasen for having continued on through blizzard conditions.[44]\\n Kaasen gave all credit to Balto,[7] telling a United Press reporter, \"I gave Balto, my lead dog, his head and trusted to him. He never once faltered\\xa0... [i]t was Balto who led the way, the credit is his.\"[45] After reaching Dr. Welch\\'s office to deliver the serum, Kaasen tended to Balto, hugging him and purportedly[11] repeating, \"Damn fine dog\\xa0... damn fine dog.\"[34][46] On the U.S. Senate chamber floor several days later, Washington Senator Clarence Dill recognized the efforts of everyone who helped with the serum run but cited Balto in particular, saying, \"[t]his black Siberian dog, through the darkness and storm, crossed this icy desert and kept the trail when no human being could possibly have found the way.\"[47] The H. K. Mulford Company, one of the manufacturers of the serum units, awarded Kaasen a $1,000 prize (equivalent to $17,374 in 2023) alongside inscribed medals which were given to all the mushers.[48]\\n Newspapers were heralding the feats achieved during the serum run almost exclusively to Balto, eclipsing the efforts of the 18 other mushers and 150 sled dogs who participated.[10][12] The death toll in Nome was seven people—not counting Alaskan Natives who were not recorded—adding further to the media sensation as the diphtheria epidemic was seemingly averted.[12] When the New York Daily News published exclusive photos of Kaasen\\'s arrival in Nome, Balto was pictured directly in the foreground of the entire team;[49] these photos were later revealed to be staged recreations hours after Kaasen arrived.[11] The recent adoption of radio in the contiguous United States also meant dispatches from Nome had been relayed to radio stations throughout the country.[12][50] As 1925 ended, Balto was credited in news coverage as having accomplished the entire serum run by himself,[10] a misconception that persisted long after his death.[51]\\n Film producer Sol Lesser promptly signed Kaasen, Balto and the team of \"thirteen half wolves\" to a contract with Educational Pictures for a movie based on the serum run.[52] Film production began in April 1925 in Los Angeles. Upon arriving in the city, Balto was the recipient of the \"bone of the city\" by the mayor of Los Angeles, along with other dignitaries[53] including actress Mary Pickford.[54] The two-reel movie, Balto\\'s Race to Nome, debuted the following month to positive reviews;[55] it is now considered a lost film. Shortly after the film\\'s release, Kaasen sued Lesser for unpaid wages;[56] Lesser then sold the existing contract to the vaudeville circuit.[1] Kaasen and Balto soon traveled across the country, making public appearances and being bestowed gifts from the cities visited.[57][58] In one instance, while visiting Cleveland, Ohio, Kaasen was awarded a subscription to The Plain Dealer as a gift from an existing subscriber, to be delivered to his home in Nome.[59]\\n A statue of Balto, sculpted by Frederick Roth, was erected in New York City\\'s Central Park on December 17, 1925, ten months after Balto\\'s arrival in Nome. Balto modeled in front of Roth[60][61] and was present for the monument\\'s unveiling.[62] The statue is located on the main path leading north from the Tisch Children\\'s Zoo.[63] In front of the statue, a low-relief slate plaque depicts Balto\\'s sled team and bears the inscription, \"[d]edicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxin six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the winter of 1925: endurance, fidelity, intelligence\".[63][64]\\n Seppala had been \"amazed and vastly amused\" at Balto and Kaasen\\'s celebrity statuses,[65] but was displeased as it overlooked his lead dog Togo, who went through the run\\'s longest and most dangerous part.[66][67] Seppala made a similar cross-country tour with Togo and his teammates in 1926, including a gala ice-rink appearance at Madison Square Garden, believing that Togo had been deprived of fame and acclaim.[10] Before relocating to Poland Spring, Maine, in March 1927, Seppala claimed Fox was the actual leader of Kaasen\\'s team[68] and failed to get any proper credit due to Fox\\'s name being more common and would not stand out in newspaper headlines like Balto.[69] A February 1932 interview Seppala had with Henry McLemore furthered this, claiming a newspaper reporter simply chose Balto as \"the lead dog\\xa0... that brought the serum in\" after multiple names were offered by Seppala; as he was still riding to Nome with Togo at the time, this is likely anachronistic.[70] The \"Vaccine Research Association\" unsuccessfully called for the Central Park statue\\'s removal in 1931,[71] citing a 1929 interview where Seppala claimed all the dramatic events surrounding the run were fabricated to sell newspapers.[72] Unwilling to show disrespect to a sled dog, Seppala partly backtracked from these claims in his memoir:[69]\\n I hope I shall never be the man to take away credit from any dog or driver who participated in that run. We all did our best. But when the country was roused to enthusiasm over the serum run driver, I resented the statue to Balto, for if any dog deserved special mention it was Togo\\xa0... At the time I left [for the run] I never dreamed that anyone could consider these dogs [the second string] fit to drive even in a short relay.\\xa0... As to the leader, it was up to the driver who happened to be selected to choose any dog he liked, and he chose Balto.[4] After the dispute with Lesser was resolved,[73] Balto and his teammates were sold to Sam Houston, owner of a traveling circus. The exact circumstances for the sale are unclear: some accounts, including Houston himself, claimed Kaasen sold the dogs after tiring of the constant traveling and moved back to Alaska.[1][74] Other accounts claimed Seppala made the deal with Houston and ordered Kaasen—who was still under his employ at the Pioneer Mining Company—back to Alaska.[75] Seppala claimed in his memoir that he sold the dogs to Lesser, with Balto selling for much more \"on account of the publicity given to his \\'glorious achievements\\'\".[4] Kaasen and Seppala never spoke to each other again.[10] Kaasen\\'s departure occurred after the Central Park statue unveiling; upon returning to Nome one year after the run,[76] he found himself alienated by residents of Nome over his fame, with some expressing resentment over the bypassing of Ed Rohn.[77] By May 1947, Seppala dismissed the serum run as little more than \"just an ordinary hard run\" and Balto\\'s fame as \"a product of modern publicity rather than of outstanding merit\\xa0... Balto was just a good average dog\".[78]\\n Balto and his team continued on tour throughout much of 1926 under the ownership of Sam Houston in both his circus and theatre circuits.[79][80] By February 1927, stories emerged of Balto and six teammates living in the back room of a \"for men only\"[81] dime museum in Los Angeles,[82][83] also described as a freak show.[1] After leaving the vaudeville circuit, Balto and his team briefly resided at a farm,[73] only to be taken back to the city after misbehaving and entering a chicken coop.[82] Balto and his teammates were displayed chained to a sled,[1][34] with their only exercise consisting of brief trips in the museum\\'s back alley.[81] They were malnourished, with their ribs showing.[50] Jack Wooldridge of the Oakland Tribune wrote about the mistreatment, \"[t]here probably was never a more dejected, sorrowful looking lot of malamutes than these as they now appear. Balto will never see the snow again. He\\'s simply an exhibit in a museum.\"[82]\\n Cleveland businessman George Kimble visited the dime museum while in Los Angeles after noticing a sign outside advertising \"Balto the wonder dog\".[34][e] Outraged at seeing Balto and his teammates in poor health,[1][50] Kimble offered to buy the dogs from Sam Houston, who was willing to sell,[74] but demanded $2,000 (equivalent to $35,080 in 2023), more than Kimble could personally afford.[50] Kimble reached out to area businessmen and elected officials, along with The Plain Dealer,[1] and assembled the Cleveland Balto Committee led by Common Pleas Judge James B. Ruhl,[85] which negotiated with Houston.[74] After Houston agreed to sell the dogs for $1,500, a fund raising campaign was formally announced in the March 1, 1927, Plain Dealer, and the Brookside Zoo promised to create lodging for the dogs.[73][86] Raising $200 on the campaign\\'s first day, a ten-day option was obtained,[74] and the dogs were temporarily relocated to a ranch as a foster home.[87] The Plain Dealer carried daily tallies of donations to the campaign.[f] Donations came from all over the city, with Cleveland schoolchildren dropping loose change in buckets[50] and offering their milk money;[84] along with children, bank employees, offices and nonprofit institutions all making donations.[85] Within four days, the committee grew from seven members to seventeen.[89] Area kennel clubs, shops and hotels also made contributions.[84]\\n Appeals to donate were broadcast over radio stations WDBK, WHK and WTAM,[88] along with stations in Detroit and elsewhere; one response came from Japan after a listener there heard an appeal over WJZ in New York by long-distance reception.[90] Three models for the William Taylor & Son department store were driven around downtown Cleveland promoting the campaign.[90][94] The Los Angeles Alaskan Society subsequently offered to buy the team if the $2,000 could not be raised in time by the Cleveland effort, as the ten-day option had been publicized in the Los Angeles Daily Times.[73][91] By the evening of March 8, $1,517 had been raised, prompting one last-minute appeal by the Plain Dealer;[92] the following morning, the fund surpassed the $2,000 goal, totaling $2,245.88 (equivalent to $39,393 in 2023) and securing the purchase of the entire seven-dog team.[93] The effort won the praise of Roald Amundsen, who compared it to the city of Oslo adopting the lone surviving dog from his expedition to the South Pole.[93] A Plain Dealer editorial on the campaign\\'s success read, \"[t]he city which honors a worthy dumb animal honors itself. Cleveland looks forward to welcoming its Alaskan guests a few days hence and hopes their life here may be long and pleasant.\"[95]\\n Balto and his six teammates—Alaska Slim, Fox, Tillie, Billie, Old Moctoc and Sye[g]—were transported by train from Los Angeles to Cleveland along with identification papers;[98] arriving March 16, the dogs were escorted to temporary quarters at Brookside Zoo.[99][100] A grand parade took place at the Public Square on March 19, 1927, which the city designated as \"Balto Day\".[101] Despite rainy conditions, thousands of people were present[h] as the team pulled a sled modified with iron wheels making it navigable on cobblestone streets and streetcar tracks; two local Boy Scout troops carried signs announcing Balto\\'s arrival and a map of the serum run,[102] while five local people were \"sourdough\"[i] escorts.[103] In the rotunda of Cleveland City Hall, Judge Ruhl read a deed of gift that transferred ownership of Balto and his team to the city \"forever\".[102][104][105] After the parade, the dogs were all transported to a more permanent housing at the zoo.[102]\\n Balto and his teammates made their formal debut at the Brookside Zoo on March 20, 1927, with estimates of up to 15,000 people visiting the zoo that day.[106] Even with his permanent residence at the zoo, Balto occasionally made public appearances, including at an exhibition hosted by the Western Reserve Kennel Club in which Balto won \"best of show\" honors.[107] Balto also made an appearance at a parade for the 1929 National Air Races.[108]\\n Owing to the Brookside Zoo\\'s location in a valley, the team would pull sleds during winter weather conditions; one snowfall in early January 1928, turned the zoo\\'s boulevard into an icy trail, with Balto and Fox alternating lead.[109][110] The Plain Dealer occasionally anthropomorphized their depictions of Balto at the zoo, including an encounter with a visiting husky and his owner from Manitoba.[111] Another 1929 story centered around his \"daydreaming\" of Richard E. Byrd\\'s expedition of Antarctica;[112] this resulted in multiple letters to the editor that criticized the enclosure and were concerned about the welfare of the dogs.[113][114] One letter expressed regret for contributing to \"Balto to Cleveland\" fund as \"one of the most inhuman acts we could have performed\".[115] One letter written decades later recalled visiting the zoo on a hot day, with Balto tied to a tree in front of a water pan \"with a few drops of water in it\".[96] Even with these criticisms, the conditions at the zoo were generally seen as \"excellent\".[116] Zoo staff frequently sprayed the dogs to discourage fleas, their steam-heated kennel had a purpose-built shower for nightly cleaning,[117] and the dogs had a respectable diet[118] of meat in the morning, nightly dog biscuits and plentiful access to water.[109] Zoo superintendent John Kramer defended their treatment of the dogs, particularly with Fox, saying \"people don\\'t understand why we do certain things here... you can\\'t please them all.\"[119]\\n Another enclosure meant for the summer months was built for the dogs in 1930.[120] This enclosure included a bronze tablet on top of a granite monument[116] located in front of Balto\\'s cage.[121] Bearing the names of the entire seven-dog team,[122] the monument was intended as a shrine for all animal lovers of Greater Cleveland.[75][121] The dogs lived out the remainders of their lives at the zoo: Billie was the first to die,[123] followed by Fox.[116] Between 1930 and 1933, Alaska Slim, Tillie and Old Moctoc all died, with Balto and Sye the only members in the team remaining.[31]\\n Balto died on March 14, 1933, at the age of 14.[124] News of Balto\\'s declining health was published four days earlier, having lost his sight and suffering decreased mobility and paralysis.[125] Because of his advanced age,[126] the city\\'s veterinarian and zoo personnel estimated he would not be able to survive the week.[31][127] Balto\\'s death was attributed to both an enlarged heart and bladder,[128] the former as a result of stress incurred from the serum run.[51] The following day, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (CMNH) agreed to display Balto in taxidermy form.[128] Balto\\'s mounting cost $50 (equivalent to $1,177 in 2023) and was again raised through a fund-raising campaign;[129] the process included the placement of Balto\\'s skin and fur over a lifelike form as an effigy, a process that was finished by that May.[51][130] Balto\\'s thyroid and adrenal glands were preserved at the Cleveland Clinic in George Washington Crile\\'s organ collection.[75][128]\\n Sye, the last of the seven dogs, was reportedly crestfallen over Balto\\'s death, moaning, howling, and refusing to eat.[51] Sye died on March 25, 1934, one year after Balto, and was the only dog of the group to sire offspring.[131] As was the case with Balto, Sye\\'s remains were mounted for display by the zoo, initially displayed over the zoo\\'s tiger enclosure.[132] By 1965, neither the zoo or CMNH could locate the remains of Sye, which are now presumed lost.[97] Sye, Balto and Togo were the only three dogs that participated in the serum run to have had their remains mounted.[132] The monument that was erected at the zoo for the dogs, retroactively regarded as a gravestone,[75] was taken out of public display after Balto died.[129] As other zoo buildings were subsequently erected on the site of the former enclosure for Balto\\'s team, the exact site of the graves for Billie, Fox, Moctoc, Slim and Tillie are now unknown.[132]\\n Initially displayed, then placed in storage for several years, Balto was again put on public display in March 1940, coinciding with a dog show taking place at the Public Auditorium.[51] Displays of Balto were intermittent in the years since, with his remains placed in cold storage at all other times.[50] CMNH had so many animals in their collection that it became difficult to display Balto with greater frequency; in 1975, the Plain Dealer noted Balto\\'s absence as the 50th anniversary of the serum run approached, prompting CMNH to arrange an exhibition.[39] By 2000, CMNH centered Balto around exhibits about the serum run and Inuit people,[10] making his visibility permanent; wildlife resources director Harvey Webster said, \"he\\'s an icon\\xa0... [the serum run is] a story about the remarkable confluences of men and dogs who did the seemingly impossible in short order.\"[1]\\n As part of a larger $150\\xa0million renovation project, Balto\\'s remains were refurbished and reinstalled in CMNH\\'s new Visitor Hall,[133] which opened on October 15, 2023.[134] Balto is among the museum\\'s eight most iconic specimens that are represented in the Hall.[133][135]\\n In early 1998, 22 second and third-grade students at Butte Elementary School in Palmer, Alaska,[136] began a letter and petition drive to return Balto to Alaska after student Cody McGinn did a book report and discovered his remains were in Cleveland.[137] Teacher Dwight Homstad viewed Balto\\'s custody as a two-sided issue and that the students wanted to show the emotional attachment Alaskans still had toward Balto.[136] Alaskan governor Tony Knowles endorsed the effort, writing to Homstad\\'s class, \"During a time of great need in Alaska\\'s history, Balto persevered through treacherous and perilous conditions to save the lives of many Alaskans.\"[138] Homstad also contracted for a shipping crate to be transported to CMNH containing the petitions and a video made of the students writing the petitions.[139] By July 1998, the Alaska State Legislature passed a formal proclamation supporting Balto\\'s return to Alaska.[140] Homstad also offered the idea of a trade or barter with CMNH for Balto.[136]\\n They were imploring the museum to send our doggie home. And we said: \\'Wait a minute. He spent a majority of his life, actually, in Cleveland, and it was the community of Cleveland that saved him from a pretty despicable fate.\\'\\n Harvey Webster, wildlife resources director, Cleveland Museum of Natural History[10] CMNH declined both the requests for a permanent return or of shared custody (the latter McGinn advocated for[137]) citing Balto\\'s purchase by the people of Cleveland, that Balto spent 60\\xa0percent of his life in Cleveland,[136] and the fragile condition of his remains; one taxidermist estimated that, if properly cared for, a mounted specimen like Balto\\'s can last for up to two lifetimes.[139] Despite the initial refusal, the effort was soon publicized internationally with coverage in both People and CNN; one museum trustee learned of the dispute while on vacation in Indonesia.[139] CMNH announced in August 1998 that Balto would be loaned to the Anchorage Museum of History and Art, who paid substantial money to insure his mount,[10] for six months.[140] The Anchorage Museum previously sought to have Balto displayed in an exhibit tied to the 1988 Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race[42] and were in negotiations with CMNH earlier in the year about a loan.[136] Balto was placed in a special crate for the trip to Anchorage with the label \"Contents: One Hero Dog\",[10] and a CMNH curator was present at the museum for the exhibition\\'s duration.[140]\\n A second exhibition of Balto took place at the Anchorage Museum between March and May 2017;[141] again, a CMNH registrar accompanied Balto, who was placed in a climate-controlled crate on the flight to Alaska.[142] Balto and Togo were displayed side-by-side as part of the 2017 exhibit.[66]\\n The story had already heralded a winner by the time [Leonhard] Seppala made the 100 miles home. It was too complicated to showcase 20 drivers and 150 dogs. The relay as a concept was not as exciting as \\'Balto crossed the finish line.\\'\\n Gay Salisbury, historian[10] Controversy continues to surround Balto\\'s celebrity status. Mushers have placed doubt on claims Balto truly led Kaasen\\'s team, based primarily on his prior track record.[12] No records exist of Seppala ever having used him as a leader in runs or races prior to 1925, and Seppala himself stated Balto \"was never in a winning team\"[143] and was a \"scrub dog\".[66] The pictures and film of Kaasen and Balto in Nome were recreated hours after their arrival once the sun had risen. Speculation still exists as to whether Balto\\'s position as lead was genuine or staged for media purposes due to Balto being a more newsworthy and appealing name than Fox.[68][144] One 1927 newspaper editorial published after Seppala\\'s claim that Fox actually led Kaasen\\'s team read, \"[w]hether \\'Balto\\' or \\'Fox\\' matters little. The performance stands and the nation-wide emotion which it aroused is recorded in history. Somebody else wrote the works of Shakespeare, Homer was not the author of the Iliad. The lead dog on that historic trip to Nome was not Balto. What does it matter?\"[145] Balto remains more famous to the general public due to the long-held misconceptions about his role.[12][66] While some historians note it is possible Balto led Kaasen\\'s team, he at most likely ran co-lead with Fox rather than running single-lead by himself.[146]\\n The aftermath of the serum run and the fame awarded to Balto and Kaasen initiated a feud between Seppala, Kaasen and Ed Rohn that lasted for the rest of their lives and has continued to the present day.[147] Decorated mushers and others in the surrounding area—including Rohn, based on conversations the two men had before leaving Nome—believed that Kaasen\\'s decision to not wake Rohn at Point Safety was motivated by a desire to grab the glory for himself.[148] Conversely, supporters of Kaasen argue Rohn was inexperienced with mushing in severe weather.[149] Despite being the subject of widespread fame alongside Balto, Kaasen rarely spoke about the run in later years and was reluctant to make public appearances. Other mushers and residents also died without providing a full account of their respective roles, making it unlikely for the facts to ever be known.[77] The contribution of Alaska Natives, whose teams traveled the majority of the run, is also heavily obscured:[12][66][149] while contributing to the area economy and the absence of language barriers, reporters and filmmakers were disinterested in their feats.[150] Many of them died prior to the 1970s, when efforts were made to better preserve Alaskan history, and surviving mushers were given honorary \"number one\" designations in the early years of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.[151]\\n The overlooking of Togo in popular culture has come to the displeasure of mushers, some of whom have reared dogs with bloodlines traced directly to Seppala\\'s dogs and Togo specifically, something Balto could not do due to being neutered.[10] Historian Jeff Dinsdale viewed the narrative around Balto as \"heavily dependent on fantasy [that] evolved\" to usurp Togo\\'s feats and called Togo \"the greatest sled dog of all time, sort of the Gordie Howe of dog sledding\".[152] Writer Kenneth Ungermann argued Balto\\'s outsized fame was more a symbol of the feats achieved during the run, writing, \"[t]o the American public, the glorified husky was representative of Jack, Dixie, Togo, and every other leader and dog that helped carry the antitoxin and hope to the people of Nome.\"[153]\\n In a 2020 op-ed for the Anchorage Daily News, historian David Reamer criticized Balto Seppala Park in Anchorage for fostering \"the misconception of Balto as the singular hero dog of Nome\" and \"[a]ny opportunity is a good opportunity to spread the worthy truth of Togo\";[66] Reamer praised the movie Togo for remedying \"a historical misjustice\".[12] In ranking the top 10 heroic animals for Time, Katy Steinmetz placed Togo at number one, writing, \"the dog that often gets credit\\xa0... is Balto, but he just happened to run the last\\xa0... leg in the race. The sled dog who did the lion\\'s share of the work was Togo.\"[154] The National Park Service credits Togo for having \"led his team across the most dangerous leg of the journey... though Balto received the credit for saving the town, to those who know more than the Disney story [sic], Balto is considered the backup dog\".[155] CMNH has recognized Togo as \"a superb leader... courageous and strong, smart and possessing an exceptional ability to find the trail and sense danger\".[3]\\n The Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (successor to the Brookside Zoo) unveiled companion statues of Balto and Togo in 1997.[10] In 2001, a statue of Togo was unveiled at Seward Park in New York City\\'s Lower East Side, and later moved to a prominent position in the park by 2019; a change.org petition was also launched in late 2019 calling for the removal of Balto\\'s Central Park statue in favor of a statue for Togo.[12]\\n Genealogy of Balto[164]\\n Balto\\'s DNA was analyzed and sequenced as part of the Zoonomia Project, an international collaboration that has mapped the genomes of over 240 mammals.[165] After being approached by Cornell University associate professor Heather Huson about including Balto in Zoonomia, CMNH agreed and sent a skin sample to University of California, Santa Cruz professor Katherine Moon.[11] CMNH chief science officer Gavin Svenson was enthusiastic about the project and noted advancements in technology have since made it easier to map out genomes from 100-year old DNA.[46] Compared with the genomes of 682 modern-day dogs and wolves, in addition to the 240 mammals in Zoonomia,[11] Balto\\'s genome was found to be more diverse with fewer unhealthy variants than modern purebred dogs and more similar to today\\'s Alaskan huskies often outcrossed to promote better fitness and health.[166][164]\\n Balto shared part of his ancestry with modern Siberian huskies (39\\xa0percent) as well as Greenland dogs (18\\xa0percent), Chinese village dogs (17\\xa0percent), Samoyeds (6\\xa0percent) and Alaskan malamutes (4\\xa0percent).[164][167] Balto had several DNA adaptations that promoted Arctic survival, including a thick double coat, the ability to digest starch, and bone and tissue development.[166][167] Researchers were also able to accurately predict how Balto would have looked—fur coat color, eyes and fur thickness—from his surviving DNA, which was cross-referenced with historical photos and his remains.[2] Testing also disproved the urban legend that Balto had grey wolf genetics;[46] Moon said, \"[h]e was not a wolf, he was just a good boy.\"[165]', 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron (also known as Spirit) is a 2002 American animated Western film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by DreamWorks Pictures. The film was directed by Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook (in their feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay by John Fusco, based on an idea by Jeffrey Katzenberg, who produced the film alongside Mireille Soria.[4] The film combines traditional animation and computer animation.\\n Set in the Old West in the late 19th century, the film follows Spirit, a Kiger mustang stallion (voiced by Matt Damon as a narrator), who is captured during the American Indian Wars by the United States Cavalry; he is eventually freed by a Lakota man named Little Creek with whom he bonds, as well as a mare named Rain. In contrast to the anthropomorphic style of animal characters in other animated features, Spirit and his fellow horses communicate with each other through non-linguistic sounds and body language (albeit with many human facial expressions and reactions).\\n Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron was released in theaters on May 24, 2002, and was a box office disappointment, earning only $122 million on an $80 million budget, but received positive reviews. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[5][6] The film also launched a media franchise completely using computer animation, with a Netflix spin-off television series Spirit Riding Free premiering on May 5, 2017, followed by  a spin-off of the original film, titled Spirit Untamed, released on June 4, 2021.\\n In the late 19th-century American West, a Kiger mustang colt, Spirit, is born to a herd of wild horses; he grows into a stallion, and assumes the leadership of the herd. One night, upon following a strange light near his herd, Spirit finds horses tied to a log and their wranglers sleeping around a campfire. The men awaken, and, after a chase, capture Spirit and take him to a US cavalry fort.\\n The senior officer of the fort, the Colonel, orders Spirit to be broken; however, Spirit defies all attempts, while beating up the farrier. The Colonel retaliates by having him tied to a post for three days without food or water in order to weaken him. Meanwhile, a Lakota named Little Creek is also brought into the fort and held captive; his friends toss a knife over the wall for him, which he uses to secretly cut his bonds.\\n After three days, Spirit is weak enough that the Colonel temporarily subdues him, boasting that any wild horse can eventually be tamed. Seeing the other captive horses\\' disappointment, Spirit regains his strength and angrily throws the Colonel off, breaking down the corral\\'s wall in the process.  Enraged, the Colonel orders his men to kill  Spirit; however, Little Creek saves the horse, and the two escape, setting the other captive horses free in the process.\\n Little Creek and his fellow Lakotas lasso Spirit and return to their village; there,  Little Creek unsuccessfully attempts to tame Spirit with kindness. Little Creek ties the other end of Spirit\\'s lead rope to his own pet mare, Rain, hoping she can discipline him. Spirit eventually falls in love with Rain, despite not understanding her attachment to humans. He and Little Creek gradually come to respect each other; realizing that Spirit is not meant to be domesticated, Little Creek sets him free.\\n Spirit starts back towards his herd, and tries to convince Rain to come with him. They notice the Colonel and his men charging to attack the Lakota village, and return to help. During the confrontation, the Colonel shoots Rain and she falls into a river; he is about to shoot Little Creek, but Spirit knocks the Colonel off his horse, deflecting the shot and saving Little Creek\\'s life. Trying to rescue Rain, Spirit leaps into the river, but they both plummet over a waterfall. Once out of the water, Spirit stays by Rain\\'s side, only for the cavalry to recapture him and leave her for dead. Little Creek tends to Rain; realizing that Spirit saved his life, he sets out in pursuit of the cavalry.\\n Spirit is put in a train with other captured horses from the village, and becomes disheartened; however, he has a vision of his herd running free across their homeland, strengthening him again. Spirit and many other horses are then forced to work on the transcontinental railroad, sledging a steam locomotive through the woods. After noticing that the railroad will pass right through his homeland, Spirit pretends to pass out, tricking the men into releasing him, then frees the other horses by kicking their chains off of the sledge. The unattached locomotive tumbles backwards down a hill, crashes into another locomotive in a station below, and starts a fire which sets the surrounding forest ablaze. Spirit is trapped when a loose chain around his neck snags on a fallen tree, but Little Creek arrives and cuts him free; together, they escape by jumping into a ravine.\\n The next morning, the Colonel and his cavalry find Spirit and Little Creek. A chase ensues through the Grand Canyon; eventually, though seemingly trapped at the edge of a wide gorge, Spirit takes a leap of faith to the other side, with Little Creek on his back, which he succeeds at. Impressed, the Colonel stops his men from shooting at Spirit and Little Creek, gives Spirit a nod of respect, and calls off the pursuit. After celebrating their freedom, Spirit and Little Creek return to the Lakotas, meeting up with Rain, who has recovered. Little Creek tells Spirit to take care of Rain after naming him \"Spirit who could not be broken\".  Spirit leads Rain back to his herd, reuniting with his mother in the process, and they run free across the plains.\\n Writer John Fusco, best known for his work in the Western and Native American genres (such as the films Young Guns and Young Guns II), was hired by DreamWorks Animation to create an original screenplay based on an idea by Jeffrey Katzenberg.[7] Fusco began by writing and submitting a novel to the studio and then adapted his own work into a screenplay format. He remained on the project as the main writer over the course of four years, working closely with Katzenberg, the directors, and artists.[8]\\n Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron was made over the course of four years using a conscious blend of traditional hand-drawn animation and computer animation.[8] James Baxter said that the animation was the most difficult piece of production he worked on for a movie: \"I literally spent the first few weeks with my door shut, telling everyone, \\'Go away; I\\'ve got to concentrate.\\' It was quite daunting because when I first started to draw horses, I suddenly realized how little I knew.\" The team at DreamWorks, under his guidance, used a horse named \"Donner\" as the model for Spirit and brought the horse to the animation studio in Glendale, California for the animators to study.[8] Sound designer Tim Chau was dispatched to stables outside Los Angeles to record the sounds of real horses; the final product features real hoof beats and horse vocals that were used to express their vocalizations in the film.[9] None of the animal characters in the film speak English beyond occasional reflective narration from the protagonist mustang, voiced by Matt Damon in the film.[10] Many of the animators who worked on Spirit would later work on Shrek 2, as their influence can be seen for the character Donkey.[11] The production team, consisting of Kelly Asbury, Lorna Cook, Mireille Soria, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Kathy Altieri, Luc Desmarchelier, Ron Lukas, and story supervisor Ronnie del Carmen took a trip to the western United States to view scenic places they could use as inspiration for locations in the film. The homeland of the mustangs and Lakotas is based on Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Yosemite National Park, and the  Teton mountain range; the cavalry outpost was also based on Monument Valley.\\n Traveling to all those different places, we were reminded that this is a magnificent country, so in some respects, it was a way for us to honor and to celebrate the grandeur in our own backyard. Geographically, we kind of threw convention out the window. We took the best from nature and gave it our own spin, and ultimately it served the story well.  Additional animation and fine line services were provided by Anvil Studios, Bardel Entertainment and Stardust Pictures.\\n The instrumental score was composed by Hans Zimmer with songs by Bryan Adams in both the English and French versions of the album. The opening theme song for the film, \"Here I Am\" was written by Bryan Adams, Gretchen Peters, and Hans Zimmer. It was produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Another song, not included in the film itself (although it can be heard in the ending credits), is \"Don\\'t Let Go\", which is sung by Bryan Adams with Sarah McLachlan on harmonies and piano. It was written by Bryan Adams, Gavin Greenaway, Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, and Gretchen Peters. Many of the songs and arrangements were set in the American West, with themes based on love, landscapes, brotherhood, struggles, and journeys. Garth Brooks was originally supposed to write and record songs for the film but the deal fell through.\\n Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron was released in theaters on May 24, 2002.\\n Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron was released on VHS and DVD on November 19, 2002.[13] It was re-released on DVD on May 18, 2010.[14] The film was released on Blu-ray by Paramount Home Entertainment, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on May 13, 2014.[15]\\n On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron holds an overall approval rating of 69% based on 127 reviews, with an average rating of 6.40/10. The site\\'s critical consensus reads: \"A visually stunning film that may be too predictable and politically correct for adults, but should serve children well.\"[16] Review aggregator Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[17] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[18]\\n Critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and said in his review, \"Uncluttered by comic supporting characters and cute sidekicks, Spirit is more pure and direct than most of the stories we see in animation – a fable I suspect younger viewers will strongly identify with.\"[19] Leonard Maltin of Hot Ticket called it \"one of the most beautiful and exciting animated features ever made\". Clay Smith of Access Hollywood considered the film \"An Instant Classic\".[20] Jason Solomons described the film as \"a crudely drawn DreamWorks animation about a horse that saves the West by bucking a US Army General\".[21] USA Today\\'s Claudia Puig gave it 3 stars out of 4, writing that the filmmakers\\' \"most significant achievement is fashioning a movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults, as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats.\"[22] Dave Kehr of the New York Times criticized the way in which the film portrayed Spirit and Little Creek as \"pure cliches\" and suggested that the film could have benefited from a comic relief character.[23] The film was screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.[24] Rain was the first animated horse to receive an honorary registration certificate from the American Paint Horse Association (APHA).[25]\\n When the film opened on Memorial Day Weekend 2002, the film earned $17,770,036 on the Friday-Sunday period, and $23,213,736 through the four-day weekend for a $6,998 average from 3,317 theaters. The film overall opened in fourth place behind Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, Spider-Man, and Insomnia. In its second weekend, the film retreated 36% to $11,303,814 for a $3,362 average from expanding to 3,362 theaters and finishing in fifth place for the weekend. In its third weekend, the film decreased 18% to $9,303,808 for a $2,767 average from 3,362 theaters. The film closed on September 12, 2002, after earning $73,280,117 in the United States and Canada with an additional $49,283,422 overseas for a worldwide total of $122,563,539, against an $80 million budget.\\n Two video games based on the film were released on October 28, 2002, by THQ: the PC game Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron — Forever Free and the Game Boy Advance game Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron — Search for Homeland.[40]\\n A third game \"Lucky\\'s Big Adventure\" was released in 2021 based on the \"Untamed\" film sequel below.\\n Book series\\n Shortly after the movie, a book series called “Spirit of the West” was released by writer Kathleen Duey; telling the story of Spirit\\'s family lineage and herd.[41]\\n A computer-animated spin-off television series based on the film, titled Spirit Riding Free, premiered on Netflix on May 5, 2017.[42] The series follows all the daring adventures when Spirit, who is the offspring of the original, meets a girl named Lucky whose courage matches his own.[43][44]\\n A computer-animated film, titled Spirit Untamed, was released on June 4, 2021, by Universal Pictures. It is a film adaptation of the spin-off series Spirit Riding Free as well as a spin-off of the original film.[45][46]', 'The Aristocats is a 1970 American animated comedy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and distributed by Buena Vista Distribution. It is directed by Wolfgang Reitherman and written by Ken Anderson, Larry Clemmons, Eric Cleworth, Vance Gerry, Julius Svendsen, Frank Thomas and Ralph Wright. It is the final Disney animated film made with the involvement of Walt Disney Productions\\' co-founder Roy O. Disney before his death on December 20, 1971. The film is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, and revolves around a family of aristocratic cats, and how an alley cat acquaintance helps them after a butler has kidnapped them to gain his mistress\\'s fortune which was intended to go to them. The film features the voices of Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Hermione Baddeley, Dean Clark, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers, and Roddy Maude-Roxby.\\n In 1962, The Aristocats project began as an original script for a two-part live-action episode for Walt Disney\\'s Wonderful World of Color, developed by writers Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe and producer Harry Tytle. Following two years of rewrites, Tytle suggested the project would be more suitable for an animated film, in which Disney temporarily shelved the project while The Jungle Book (1967) advanced into production. When The Jungle Book was nearly complete, Disney appointed Ken Anderson to develop preliminary work on The Aristocats, making it the last film project to be personally approved by Disney before his death.[3][4][5] Longtime Disney collaborators Robert and Richard Sherman composed multiple songs for the film, though only two made it in the finished product.\\n The Aristocats was released on December 24, 1970, to generally positive reviews from film critics. It was also a commercial success. A live-action remake is currently in development, with Questlove attached to direct.\\n In 1910, mother cat Duchess and her three kittens, Berlioz, Marie, and Toulouse, live in Paris with retired opera diva Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, and her English butler, Edgar. The cats are pampered pets that live a luxurious lifestyle and are very cultured in art and music, like their owner.\\n While preparing her will with elderly lawyer Georges Hautecourt, Madame declares that her vast fortune will be first left to her cats, then revert to Edgar once they all pass away. Edgar overhears this through a speaking tube and, after erroneously calculating that he will die before he can claim his inheritance, plots to eliminate the cats. He sedates them by putting sleeping pills in a dish of cream, then drives them on his motorcycle out to the countryside in a basket. There, he is ambushed by two hounds named Napoleon and Lafayette, losing his hat, sidecar, umbrella, shoes, and the basket before escaping. The cats are left stranded in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the mouse, and Frou-Frou the horse discover their absence.\\n The next morning, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O\\'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris. The group briefly hitchhikes in a milk truck before being chased out by the driver. Later, while crossing a railroad trestle, the cats narrowly avoid an oncoming train, and Marie falls into a river. O\\'Malley immediately dives in and rescues her, and is himself rescued by Amelia and Abigail Gabble, two English geese on holiday. The geese lead the cats to the outskirts of Paris, then depart to reunite with their inebriated Uncle Waldo. Meanwhile, Edgar returns to the countryside to retrieve his possessions (the only evidence that can incriminate him) from Napoleon and Lafayette and, after some difficulty, ultimately succeeds.\\n Traveling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet up with O\\'Malley\\'s friend Scat Cat who performs the song \"Ev\\'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\" with several other cat musicians. After the band has departed, O\\'Malley and Duchess converse on a nearby rooftop while the kittens listen at a windowsill. Duchess\\' loyalty to Madame prompts her to decline O\\'Malley\\'s marriage proposal. The next day, Duchess and the kittens return to Madame\\'s mansion. Edgar finds them before Madame does, and places them in a sack, deciding to ship them to Timbuktu.\\n Roquefort catches up with O\\'Malley at Duchess’ instruction, and O\\'Malley returns to the mansion, sending Roquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang. Though he struggles to explain the situation to the alley cats, Roquefort successfully brings them to O\\'Malley\\'s aid. O\\'Malley, the alley cats, and Frou-Frou fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens. At the end of the fight, Edgar is locked in his own packing-case and sent to Timbuktu himself.\\n The Aristocats return to Madame Adelaide, who, unaware of the reason for Edgar\\'s departure, rewrites her will to exclude him. After adopting O\\'Malley into the family, Madame establishes a charity foundation, housing Paris\\' stray cats in the mansion. Scat Cat and his gang are the first to move in, and reprise their song so loudly that the two hound dogs can hear it out in the countryside.\\n On December 9, 1961, Walt Disney suggested that Harry Tytle and Tom McGowan find some animal stories to adapt as a two-part live-action episode for the Wonderful World of Color television program. By New Year\\'s 1962, McGowan had found several stories including a children\\'s book about a mother cat and her kittens set in New York City.[7] However, Tytle felt that the London setting had added a significant element to One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) and suggested setting the story of the cats in Paris. Following a rough storyline, the story became about two servants—a butler and a maid—who were in line to inherit a fortune of an eccentric mistress after the pet cats died and focused on their feeble and foolish attempts to eliminate the felines.[7] Boris Karloff and Françoise Rosay were in mind to portray the butler and the distressed Madame.[8] A subplot centered around a mother cat hiding her kittens to keep them out of danger in a variety of different homes and locales around Paris. During the filming of Escapade in Florence (1962), McGowan brought Tytle the story that had been written by Tom Rowe, an American writer who was living in Paris.[7]\\n By August 1962, they sent the completed story treatment to Burbank, where it was returned as \"rejected\" by the Disney studios. McGowan, upset at the rejection, suggested selling the treatment elsewhere, but later learned Disney was staying at the Connaught in London. McGowan then slipped the treatment into an envelope for Disney to read at the hotel desk.[7] Disney contacted McGowan, stating he had liked the treatment and would meet with Tytle in Lisbon, Portugal. On August 29, during their flight back to London, Disney told Tytle to purchase the story for a live-action theatrical film, with McGowan as director. Disney also recommended further story revisions, one of which was eliminating one of the kitten characters.[10]\\n The script revisions were later made in January and February 1963. In June 1963, Rowe had written a letter to Disney addressing his displeasure of the script revisions, in which Tytle responded to Rowe that the changes Disney approved of would be kept. However, the project was temporarily shelved, and in August 1963, Tytle suggested that The Aristocats should be reworked into an animated feature, to which Disney agreed. At Disney\\'s recommendation, Tytle presented the project to Wolfgang Reitherman, who was directing The Jungle Book (1967), who agreed it would work as an animated film.[11][12] For that reason, Disney temporarily shelved the project as the animation department was occupied with The Jungle Book (1967).[13] In April 1964, story artist Otto Englander was assigned to work on the project. In November 1964, during a story meeting, Disney felt the cats should talk amongst themselves but never in front of the humans, in a similar approach as in One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961).[11] Because of the production delays, studio producer Bill Anderson advised Tytle to centralize his efforts on live action projects, and he was subsequently replaced by Winston Hibler.[14]\\n In 1966, Disney assigned Ken Anderson to determine whether The Aristocats would be suitable for an animated feature. With occasional guidance from Reitherman, Anderson worked from scratch and simplified the two stories into one that focused more on the cats.[13] Disney saw the preliminary sketches and approved the project shortly before his death.[15] After The Jungle Book (1967) was completed, the animation department began work on The Aristocats.[13] Reitherman assumed the producing duties, and later tossed out the more emotional story of Duchess\\'s obsession to find human adopters befitting of her kittens\\' talents. Instead, the film would be retooled as an adventure comedy in the vein of One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961). Furthermore, the character Elvira, the maid, who was intended to be voiced by Elsa Lanchester, was removed from the story placing Edgar as the central villain in order to better simplify the storyline.[12]\\n As with The Jungle Book (1967), the characters were patterned on the personalities of the voice actors.[13] In 1966, Disney contacted Phil Harris to improvise the script, and shortly after, he was cast to voice Thomas O\\'Malley. To differentiate the character from Baloo, Reitherman noted O\\'Malley was \"more based on Clark Gable than Wallace Beery, who was partly the model for Baloo.\"[13] Furthermore, Reitherman cast Eva Gabor as Duchess, remarking she had \"the freshest femme voice we\\'ve ever had\", and Sterling Holloway as Roquefort.[13] Louis Armstrong was initially reported to voice Scat Cat,[16] but he had to back out of the project due to illness.[17] Out of desperation, Scatman Crothers was hired to voice the character under the direction to imitate Armstrong.[18] Pat Buttram and George Lindsey were cast as the farm dogs, which proved to be popular with the filmmakers that another scene was included to have the dogs when Edgar returns to the farm to retrieve his displaced hat and umbrella.[8]\\n Ken Anderson spent eighteen months developing the design of the characters.[19] Five of Disney\\'s legendary \"Nine Old Men\" worked on it, including the Disney crew that had been working 25 years on average.[20] Originally, O\\'Malley was going to be drawn with stripes to have him resemble a tabby cat, but this was dropped after Reitherman remembered the difficulty in animating Shere Khan in The Jungle Book.[12]\\n The Aristocats was the last Disney animated feature Robert and Richard Sherman worked on as staff songwriters, growing frustrated by the studio\\'s management following Disney\\'s death. While employed, the Sherman Brothers completed their work on the film, but they would not return to Disney until they were asked to compose songs for The Tigger Movie (2000).[21]\\n The Sherman Brothers composed multiple songs, but only the title song and \"Scales and Arpeggios\" were included in the film.[8] Desiring to capture the essence of France, the Sherman Brothers composed the song \"The Aristocats\". Disney film producer Bill Anderson suggested Maurice Chevalier should sing the title song.[22] Following the suggestion, Richard Sherman imitated Chevalier\\'s voice as he performed a demo for the song. Chevalier received the demo and was brought out of retirement to sing the song. Deleted songs that were intended for the film included \"Pourquoi?\" sung by Hermione Baddeley as Madame Bonfamille, its reprise, and \"She Never Felt Alone\" sung by Robie Lester as Duchess.[23][24]\\n For the show-stopping musical number, the Sherman Brothers composed \"Le Jazz Hot\", but \"Ev\\'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\", composed by Floyd Huddleston and Al Rinker, was used instead.[25] Lastly, a villainous song was envisioned to be sung by Edgar and his assistant Elvira as a romantic duet, but the song was dropped when Elvira was removed from the story.[26] Another deleted song was for Thomas O\\'Malley titled \"My Way\\'s The Highway\", but the filmmakers had Terry Gilkyson compose the eponymous song \"Thomas O\\'Malley Cat\". Gilkyson explained, \"It was the same song, but they orchestrated it twice. They used the simpler one, because they may have thought the other too elaborate or too hot. It was a jazz version with a full orchestra.\"[27]\\n The instrumental music was composed by George Bruns, who drew from his background with jazz bands in the 1940s and decided to feature the accordion-like musette for French flavor.[28]\\n On Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic, this includes \"Thomas O\\'Malley Cat\" on the purple disc and \"Ev\\'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\" on the orange disc. On Disney\\'s Greatest Hits, this includes \"Ev\\'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\" on the red disc.\\n On August 21, 2015, in honor of the film\\'s 45th anniversary, a new soundtrack was released as part of Walt Disney Records: The Legacy Collection. The release includes the songs and score as used in the film, along with The Lost Chords of the Aristocats (featuring songs written for the film but not used), and previously released album versions of the songs as bonus tracks.[29]\\n Original songs performed in the film include:\\n The Aristocats was originally released to theaters on December 24, 1970. The film was released as a double feature with Niok, the Orphan Elephant (1957).[30] It was re-released in theaters in 1980 and 1987.\\n It was released on VHS in Europe on January 1, 1990, and in the UK in 1995. It was first released on VHS in North America on April 24, 1996, as part of the Masterpiece Collection.\\n In January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video launched the Gold Classic Collection, and The Aristocats was released on VHS and DVD on April 4, 2000.[31] The DVD contained the film in its 1.33:1 aspect ratio enhanced with Dolby 2.0 surround sound.[32] The Gold Collection release was quietly discontinued in 2006. A new single-disc Special Edition DVD (previously announced as a 2-Disc set) was released on February 5, 2008.\\n Disney released the film on Blu-ray for the first time on August 21, 2012.[33][34] The 2-disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD combo (both in Blu-ray and DVD packaging) featured a new digital transfer and new bonus material.[35] A single disc DVD edition was also released on the same day.[36]\\n In honor of Disney\\'s 100th anniversary, The Aristocats was re-released on February 28, 2023 as a Disney100 Edition (BLU-RAY + DVD).[37] A Walmart-exclusive package, released the same day, contains a collectible commemorative pin.[38]\\n By January 1972, The Aristocats had earned $10.1 million in box office rentals from the United States and Canada.[39] Overseas, the film became the most popular \"general release\" movie at the British box office in 1971 with rentals of $2.6 million.[40][41]\\n The Aristocats was the most widely-attended film in France in 1971, with 12.7 million in ticket admissions. It is currently the 20th highest-grossing film of all-time in France, earning $3.6 million in box office rentals.[42][41][43] That same year, the film was the most widely-attended film released in Germany with ticket admissions of 11.3 million. It is currently Germany\\'s 11th highest-grossing film of all-time.[44] By the end of its initial theatrical run, the film had earned domestic rentals of $11 million and $17 million in international countries,[45] for a worldwide rental of $28 million.[46]\\n The film was re-released to theaters in the United States on December 19, 1980, where it grossed an additional $18 million and again on April 10, 1987, where it grossed $17 million.[47] The film grossed $32 million worldwide from an international re-release in 1994, including $11 million in France.[48][49] The Aristocats has had a lifetime gross of $55.7 million in the United States and Canada,[50] and its total lifetime worldwide box office gross is $191 million.[2]\\n Howard Thompson of The New York Times praised the film as \"grand fun all the way, nicely flavored with tunes, and topped with one of the funniest jam sessions ever by a bunch of scraggly Bohemians headed by one Scat Cat.\"[51] Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film three stars out of four, summarizing The Aristocats as \"light and pleasant and funny, the characterization is strong, and the voices of Phil Harris (O\\'Malley the Alley Cat) and Eva Gabor (Duchess, the mother cat) are charming in their absolute rightness.\"[52] Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \"has a gentle good-natured charm which will delight the small-fry and their elders alike.\" He praised the animation, but remarked that the film \"lacks a certain kind of vigor, boldness and dash, a kind of a hard-focused emphasis which you would say was a Disney trademark.\"[53] Arthur D. Murphy of Variety praised the film writing the film is \"[h]elped immeasurably by the voices of Phil Harris, Eva Gabor, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers and others, plus some outstanding animation, songs, sentiment, some excellent dialog and even a touch of psychedelia.\"[54] Stefan Kanfer, reviewing for Time magazine, noted that \"[t]he melodies in Disney\\'s earlier efforts have been richer. But for integration of music, comedy and plot, The Aristocats has no rivals.\"[55]\\n Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune felt the film\\'s \"artwork and story do not compare to the truly great Disney films Snow White, Pinocchio, Bambi and Dumbo but there is enough juvenile humor to keep the children in their seats for the 78 minutes.\"[56] For its 1987 re-release, animation historian Charles Solomon expressed criticism for its episodic plot, anachronisms, and borrowed plot elements from earlier Disney animated features, but nevertheless wrote \"[b]ut even at their least original, the Disney artists provide better animation--and more entertainment--than the recent animated features hawking The Care Bears, Rainbow Brite and Transformers.\"[57] Writing in his book The Disney Films, Disney historian and film critic Leonard Maltin wrote that \"[t]he worst that one could say of The AristoCats is that it is unmemorable. It\\'s smoothly executed, of course, and enjoyable, but neither its superficial story nor its characters have any resonance.\"[58] Additionally, in his book Of Mice and Magic, Maltin criticized the film for re-using Phil Harris to replicate The Jungle Book\\'s Baloo, dismissing the character Thomas O\\'Malley as \"essentially the same character, dictated by the same voice personality.\"[59]\\n On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 64% of 33 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.8/10, earning it a score of \"Fresh\". The website\\'s consensus states, \"Though The Aristocats is a mostly middling effort for Disney, it is redeemed by terrific work from its voice cast and some jazzy tunes.\"[60] On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[61]\\n In 2021, the film was one of several that Disney limited to viewers 7 years of age and older on their streaming service Disney+, stating that the character Shun Gon was a racist stereotype of East Asian people.[62]\\n The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\\n In 1986 a novel was published.[64]\\n In 2005, Disneytoon Studios originally planned to make a follow-up to the film, along with sequels to Chicken Little (2005) and Meet the Robinsons (2007).[65] Originally intended to be a 2D animated feature, Disney executives decided to produce the film in computer animation in order to garner more interest.[66] Additionally, the story was meant to center around Marie, Duchess\\'s daughter, who becomes smitten by another kitten aboard a luxury cruise ship. However, she and her family must soon take on a jewel thief on the open seas.[67] The project was cancelled when John Lasseter was named Disney\\'s new chief creative officer, in which he called off all future sequels Disneytoon had planned and instead make original productions or spin-offs.[65]\\n In 2000, a television series, titled The Aristocats: The Animated Series, was commissioned by Disney Television Animation. The series would follow Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz (now teenagers and also anthropomorphic), along with a new character named Delancey. The series was scheduled to be released sometime in 2002, but production was put on hold in 2001. It would restart production in 2003, with a release scheduled for late 2006 or 2007, only for it to be scrapped after Disney\\'s acquisition of Pixar.[citation needed]\\n In January 2022, it was announced that a live-action remake is in development with Will Gluck producing under his Olive Bridge Entertainment banner and Keith Bunin writing the script with Gluck.[68] Questlove was attached to direct the film in March 2023.[69]\\n Thomas O\\'Malley, Duchess, Berlioz, Marie, and Toulouse were added to the kingdom builder mobile game Disney Magic Kingdoms in September 2023.[70]', \"The Fox and the Child (French: Le renard et l'enfant) is a 2007 French adventure drama film directed by Luc Jacquet. Starring Bertille Noël-Bruneau, Isabelle Carré and Thomas Laliberté. The English version of the film is narrated by Kate Winslet. It tells the story of a young girl who explores through a forest looking for a fox.\\n A young girl who's about 10 years old lives in a farm house in the Jura mountains in eastern France. One day in autumn, when she rides her bicycle to school through the forest, she observes a fox hunting. Of course, the fox escapes, but the girl yearns to meet the animal again.\\n During the following months, the girl spends most of her free time in the forest trying to find the fox, but she doesn't meet it again until winter arrives. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks. She is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle.\\n The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest.\\n When spring arrives, the girl is looking for foxholes and waits for the fox, who she eventually names Lily. The fox has young babies and moves from one foxhole to another because of the girl's inquisitiveness; so the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance.\\n The girl finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox comes to her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through the brittle plate glass window, shattering the glass. The fox is hurt badly but survives. The girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and are not possessions.\\n Years later she tells the whole story to her son, as seen at the end of the film. Some versions (DVD English) replace this scene with an illustration.\\n The film was shot on the Plateau de Retord in Ain, which the film director knows well because he spent his youth there, in the summer,[2] as well as in the  Abruzzo in Italy.\\nThe foxes in the film were played by six animals: Titus, Sally, Ziza, Scott, Tango and Pitchou. Titus was the fox who had been tamed by Marie-Noëlle Baroni. It died on March 17, 2008, at the advanced age of 12 years.[3]\", 'The Animals of Farthing Wood is a series of books about a group of woodland animals.[1] It originated with the 1979 book, The Animals of Farthing Wood, by Colin Dann, and was followed by six sequels and a prequel by Dann. An animated Animals of Farthing Wood television series based on the books aired in the 1990s, created by the European Broadcasting Union.[2]\\n The books tell the story of a group of woodland animals whose home has been paved over by developers. They learn of a nature reserve, White Deer Park, where they will be safe, and undertake to make the journey together. They form an Oath, promising to protect one another and overcome their natural instincts until they reach their destination.\\n The Animals of Farthing Wood, the first book in the series, was first published by John Goodchild Publishers in the United Kingdom in the first half of 1979 as two separate paperbacks. The first was known as Escape from Danger and the second was known as The Way to White Deer. After this one instance, they have been released as one novel.\\n The original book was meant to be a stand-alone book, with the animals reaching White Deer Park at the end. The success of the book led to a further six novels detailing the adventures of the animals once they reached White Deer Park, and a prequel showing how Farthing Wood came to be destroyed. The cover illustrations for this original series were painted by Portal artist Frances Broomfield.\\n Dann revealed in an interview with the \"Green Action\" radio programme on Q96 that the two-book version was special-issue for a children\\'s book club that operated through British primary schools and included some illustrations left out of the original.[citation needed]\\n In the Grip of Winter was published in 1981, Fox\\'s Feud was published in 1982, and The Fox Cub Bold was published in 1983. An omnibus edition of all three books was published in 1994 by Hutchinson. The Siege of White Deer Park was first published in 1985, In the Path of the Storm was first published in 1989, and Battle for the Park was first published in 1992. Those three books were made into a second omnibus in 1995 by Hutchinson.\\n In 1994, the last book in the series, Farthing Wood: The Adventure Begins, was released.', 'The Rescuers is a 1977 American animated adventure comedy-drama film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution. Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor respectively star as Bernard and Bianca, two mice who are members of the Rescue Aid Society, an international mouse organization dedicated to helping abduction victims around the world. Both must free 6 year old orphan Penny (voiced by Michelle Stacy) from two treasure hunters (played by Geraldine Page and Joe Flynn), who intend to use her to help them obtain a giant diamond. The film is based on a series of books by Margery Sharp, including The Rescuers (1959) and Miss Bianca (1962).\\n An early version of The Rescuers entered development in 1962, but was shelved due to Walt Disney\\'s dislike of its political overtones. During the 1970s, the film was revived as a project intended for the younger animators, with the oversight of the senior staff. Four years were spent working on the film. The Rescuers was released on June 22, 1977, to positive critical reception and became a box office success, earning $48 million against a budget of $7.5 million during its initial theatrical run. It has since grossed a total of $169 million after two re-releases in 1983 and 1989. Due to the film\\'s success, a sequel titled The Rescuers Down Under was released in 1990, which made this film the first Disney animated film to have a sequel.\\n In an abandoned riverboat in Devil\\'s Bayou, Louisiana, a 6 year old orphan named Penny drops a message in a bottle, containing a plea for help, into the river. The Rescue Aid Society, an international mouse organization inside the United Nations, finds the bottle when it washes up in New York City. The Hungarian representative, Miss Bianca, volunteers to accept the case. She chooses Bernard, a stammering janitor, as her co-agent. The two visit Morningside Orphanage, where Penny lived, and meet an old cat named Rufus. He tells them about a woman named Madame Medusa who once tried to lure Penny into her car, prompting the mice to investigate her pawn shop for clues.\\n At the pawn shop, Bianca and Bernard discover that Medusa and her partner, Mr. Snoops, are searching for the world\\'s largest diamond, the Devil\\'s Eye. The mice learn that Medusa and Snoops are currently at the Devil\\'s Bayou with Penny, whom they have kidnapped and placed under the guard of two trained crocodiles, Brutus and Nero. With the help of an albatross named Orville and a dragonfly named Evinrude, the mice follow Medusa to the bayou. There, they learn that Medusa plans to force Penny to enter a small blowhole that leads down into a blocked-off pirates\\' cave where the Devil\\'s Eye is located.\\n Bernard and Bianca find Penny and devise a plan of escape. They send Evinrude to alert the local animals, who loathe Medusa, but Evinrude is delayed when he is forced to take shelter from a cloud of bats. The following morning, Medusa and Snoops send Penny down into the cave to find the gem. Unbeknownst to Medusa, Bianca and Bernard are hiding in Penny\\'s dress pocket. The three soon find the Devil\\'s Eye within a pirate skull. As Penny pries the mouth open with a sword, the mice push the gem through it, but soon the oceanic tide rises and floods the cave. The three barely manage to escape with the diamond.\\n Medusa betrays Snoops and hides the diamond in Penny\\'s teddy bear, while holding Penny and Snoops at gunpoint. When she trips over a cable set as a trap by Bernard and Bianca, Medusa loses the bear and the diamond to Penny, who runs away with them. The local animals arrive at the riverboat and aid Bernard and Bianca in trapping Brutus and Nero, then set off Mr. Snoops\\'s fireworks to create more chaos. Meanwhile, Penny and the mice commandeer Medusa\\'s swamp-mobile, a makeshift airboat. Medusa unsuccessfully pursues them, using Brutus and Nero as water-skis. As the riverboat sinks from the fireworks\\' damage, Medusa crashes and is left clinging to the boat\\'s smoke stacks. Mr. Snoops escapes on a raft and laughs at her, while the irritated Brutus and Nero turn on her and circle below.\\n Back in New York City, the Rescue Aid Society watch a news report of how Penny found the Devil\\'s Eye, which has been given to the Smithsonian Institution while it is implied that Medusa and Mr. Snoops have been arrested. It also mentions she has been adopted. The meeting is interrupted when Evinrude arrives with a call for help, sending Bernard and Bianca on a new adventure.\\n In 1959, the book The Rescuers by Margery Sharp had been published to considerable success. In 1962, Sharp followed up with a sequel titled Miss Bianca. That same year, the books were optioned by Walt Disney, who began developing an animated film adaptation. In January 1963, story artist Otto Englander wrote a story treatment based on the first book, centering on a Norwegian poet unfairly imprisoned in a Siberia-like stronghold known as the Black Castle.[2] The story was revised with the location changed to Cuba, in which the mice would help the poet escape into the United States.[3] However, as the story became overtly involved in international intrigue, Disney shelved the project as he was unhappy with the political overtones.[4] In August 1968, Englander wrote another treatment featuring Bernard and Bianca rescuing Richard the Lionheart during the Middle Ages.[2]\\n A total of four years were spent working on The Rescuers, which was made on a budget of $7.5 million.[5] During the early 1970s, The Rescuers reentered development as a project for the young animators, led by Don Bluth, with the studio planning to alternate between full-scale \"A pictures\" and smaller, scaled-back \"B pictures\" with simpler animation. The animators had selected the most recent book, Miss Bianca in the Antarctic, to adapt from. The new story involved a King penguin deceiving a captured polar bear into performing in shows aboard a schooner, causing the unsatisfied bear to place a bottle that would reach the mice. Fred Lucky, a newly hired storyboard artist, was assigned to develop the story adaptation, alongside Ken Anderson.[6] This version of the story was dropped, to which Lucky explained the Arctic setting \"was too stark a background for the animators.\"[7] Vance Gerry, also a storyboard artist, also explained director Wolfgang Reitherman \"decided not to go with Fred Lucky\\'s version. He said, \"\\'It\\'s too complicated. I want a simple story: A little girl gets kidnapped and the mice try to get her back, period.\\'\"[8] According to Burny Mattinson, he stated: \"Our problem was that the penguin wasn\\'t formidable or evil enough for the audience to believe he would dominate the big bear. We struggled with that for a year or so. We changed the locale to somewhere in America and it was now a regular zoo and we tried to come up with something with the bear in the zoo and needing to be rescued but that didn\\'t work either.\"[3]\\n In that version, the bear character was still retained, but was renamed Louie the Bear. Jazz singer Louis Prima was cast in the role and had recorded most of the dialogue and multiple songs that were composed by Floyd Huddleston.[9] The writers also expanded the role of his best friend, Gus the Lion.[10] Huddleston had stated, \"It\\'s about two animals. One is Louis Prima — he\\'s the polar bear — and Redd Foxx is the lion ...Louis gets cornered into leaving and going to the South Pole where he can make himself a bigger star. But he gets homesick; he feels fooled. They send out little mice as \\'rescuers\\'.\"[11] By November 1973, the role of Louie the Bear had been heavily scaled back and then eliminated.[10] In one version, the bear was meant to be Bernard and Bianca\\'s connection to Penny. Gerry explained, \"We developed the sequence where, while the two mice are searching for clues as to where Penny has been taken, they come across this bear who she had been friends with because the orphanage where Penny was living was near the zoo.\"[3] In the final film, the idea was reduced to a simple scene where Bernard enters a zoo and hears a lion\\'s roar that scares him away.[8]\\n While promoting the release of Robin Hood (1973) in Europe, Reitherman stated: \"I took Margery Sharp\\'s books along and there was in there a mean woman in a crystal palace. When I got back I called some of the guys together and I said, \\'We\\'ve got to get a villain in this thing.\\'\"[2] The villainess and her motive to steal a diamond was adapted from the Diamond Duchess in Miss Bianca. The setting was then changed to the bayous found in the Southern United States.[7] By August 1973, the villainess was named the Grand Duchess with Phyllis Diller cast in the role.[10] A month later, Ken Anderson began depicting Cruella de Vil, the villainess from One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), as the main antagonist of the film.[10][13] Anderson had drawn several sketches of Cruella de Vil sporting alligator-leathered chic attire and sunglasses; one sketch depicted her wearing bell-bottom pants and platform shoes.[14] However, several staff members such as animator Ollie Johnston stated it felt wrong to attempt a sequel for the character.[15] Furthermore, Mattinson explained that Milt Kahl did not want to animate Cruella de Vil. \"Milt, of course, was very strong against that, \\'Oh, no no. We\\'re gonna have a new character. I\\'m not gonna do Cruella\\',\" Mattinson recalled, \"Because he felt that Marc [Davis] had animated Cruella beautifully. He was not gonna go and take his character.\"[13]\\n The new villain was named Madame Medusa, and her appearance was based on Kahl\\'s then-wife, Phyllis Bounds (who was the niece of Lillian Disney), whom he divorced in 1978.[16] This was Kahl\\'s last film for the studio, and he wanted his final character to be his best. He was so insistent on perfecting Madame Medusa that he ended up doing almost all the animation for the character himself.[17] The kidnapped child Penny was inspired by Patience, the orphan in the novel. The alligator characters Brutus and Nero was based on the two bloodhounds, Tyrant and Torment, in the novels. For the henchman, the filmmakers adapted the character, Mandrake, into Mr. Snoops. His appearance was caricatured from John Culhane, a journalist, who had been interviewing animators at the Disney studios.[15][18] Culhane claimed he was practically tricked into posing for various reactions, and his movements were imitated on Mr. Snoops\\'s model sheet. However, he stated, \"Becoming a Disney character was beyond my wildest dreams of glory.\"[19]\\n The writers had considered depicting Bernard and Bianca as married professional detectives, but decided that depicting them as novices in a new relationship was more compelling and romantic.[7][20] For the supporting characters, a pint-sized swamp mobile for the mice—a leaf powered by a dragonfly—was created. As they developed the comedic potential of displaying his exhaustion through buzzing, the dragonfly grew from an incidental into a major character.[21] Veteran sound effects artist and voice actor Jimmy MacDonald came out of retirement to provide the effects.[22] Additionally, the local swamp creatures were originally written as a dedicated home guard that drilled and marched incessantly. However, the writers rewrote them into a volunteer group of helpful little bayou creatures. Their leader, a singing bullfrog, voiced by Phil Harris, was cut from the film,[23] as were lines characterizing muskrat Ellie Mae as their outspoken boss.[24] For Bernard and Bianca\\'s transportation, a pigeon was proposed (specifically one that would be catapulted, repurposing an unused gag from Robin Hood),[25] until Johnston remembered a True-Life Adventures film featuring albatrosses and their clumsy take-offs and landings, leading him suggest that ungainly bird instead.[26] A scene of the mice preparing for their adventure, with Bianca choosing outfits and Bernard testing James Bond-like gadgets, was cut for pacing.[20] On February 13, 1976, co-director John Lounsbery died of a heart attack during production. Art Stevens, an animator, was then selected as the new co-director.[27]\\n After the commercial success of The Aristocats (1970), then-vice president Ron Miller pledged that new animators should be hired to ensure \"a\\xa0continuity of quality Disney animated films for another generation.\"[28] Eric Larson, one of the \"Nine Old Men\" animators, scouted for potential artists who were studying at art schools and colleges throughout the United States. More than 60 artists were brought into the training program.[28] Then, the selected trainees were to create a black-and-white animation test, which were reviewed at the end of the month. The process would continue for several months, in which the few finalists were first employed as in-betweeners working only on nights and weekends.[29] By 1977, more than 25 artists were hired during the training program.[30] Among those selected were Glen Keane, Ron Clements, and Andy Gaskill, all of whom would play crucial roles in the Disney Renaissance.[31] Because of this, The Rescuers was the first collaboration between the newly recruited trainees and the senior animators.[30] It would also mark the last joint effort by Milt Kahl, Ollie Johnston, and Frank Thomas, and the first Disney film Don Bluth had worked on as a directing animator, instead of as an assistant animator.[26]\\n Ever since One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), animation for theatrical Disney animated films had been done by xerography, which had only been able to produce black outlines. By the time The Rescuers was in production, the technology had been improved for the cel artists to use a medium-grey toner in order to create a softer-looking line.[32]\\n Sammy Fain was first hired as a lyricist and wrote two original songs \"Swamp Volunteers March\" and \"The Rescuers Aid Society\". Meanwhile, the filmmakers had listened to an unproduced musical composed by the songwriting team of Carol Connors and Ayn Robbins.[23] Both women had first met each other in 1973 on a double date. Before then, Connors had co-composed and sang successful songs such as \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\" and \"Hey Little Cobra\" with the Teddy Bears. Meanwhile, Robbins worked as a personal secretary to actors George Kennedy and Eva Gabor and wrote unpublished poetry.[33]\\n Desiring more contemporary songs for the film, Reitherman called Connors and Robbins into his office and shown them storyboards of Bernard and Bianca flying on Orville. Connors and Robbins then composed \"Tomorrow Is Another Day\" to accompany the scene. They later composed the symphonic piece \"The Journey\" to play during the opening titles.[34] Near the end of the film\\'s production, Reitherman asked artist Mel Shaw to illustrate pastel sketches to accompany the music. Shaw agreed and was assisted by Burny Mattinson.[35]\\n Connors and Robbins wrote another song \"The Need To Be Loved\", but Reitherman preferred Fain\\'s song \"Someone\\'s Waiting for You\". He nevertheless asked both women to compose new lyrics for the songs. They also recomposed a new version of the \"Rescuers Aid Society\" song.[34] Most of the songs they had written for the film were performed by Shelby Flint.[36] Also, for the first time since Bambi (1942), all the most prominent songs were sung as part of a narrative, as opposed to by the film\\'s characters as in most Disney animated films.\\n Describing their collaborative process, Robbins noted \"...Carol plays the piano and I play the pencil.\" During production, both women were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Gonna Fly Now\" from Rocky (1976) with Bill Conti.[36]\\n Original songs performed in the film include:\\n Songs heard in the film but not released on the soundtrack include:\\n On June 19, 1977, The Rescuers premiered at the AFI Silver Theatre in Washington, D.C.,[37] and was accompanied with the live-action nature documentary film, A Tale of Two Critters (1977).[38] By January 1979, the film had earned $15 million in distributor rentals from the United States and Canada,[39] achieving the highest-gross for an animated film during its initial release.[40]\\n The film was the highest-grossing film in France in 1977, out-grossing Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me.[40] It received admissions of $7.2 million.[41] The film also became the highest-grossing film in West Germany for 1977,[42] earning $6 million during its first 20 days of release.[40] Altogether, it received admissions of 10.3 million.[43] During its release, it earned $48–50 million in worldwide gross rentals at the box office.[44][5]\\n The Rescuers was re-released in 1983 and 1989.[18] During its 1983 re-release, the film was accompanied with the new Mickey Mouse featurette, Mickey\\'s Christmas Carol, which marked the character\\'s first theatrical appearance after a 30-year absence. The film grossed $21 million domestically.[45] In 1989, the film earned $21.2 million domestically.[46] The film\\'s total lifetime domestic gross is $71.2 million,[47] and its total lifetime worldwide gross is $169 million.[1]\\n To tie in with the film\\'s 25th anniversary, The Rescuers debuted in the Walt Disney Classics Collection line in 2002, with three different figures featuring three of the film\\'s characters, as well as the opening title scroll. The three figures were sculpted by Dusty Horner and they were: Brave Bianca, featuring Miss Bianca the heroine and priced at $75,[48] Bold Bernard, featuring hero Bernard, priced also at $75[49] and Evinrude Base, featuring Evinrude the dragonfly and priced at $85.[48] The title scroll featuring the film\\'s name, The Rescuers, and from the opening song sequence, \"The Journey,\" was priced at $30. All figures were retired in March 2005, except for the opening title scroll which was suspended in December 2012.[48]\\n The Rescuers was the inspiration for another Walt Disney Classics Collection figure in 2003. Ken Melton was the sculptor of Teddy Goes With Me, My Dear, a limited-edition, 8-inch sculpture featuring the evil Madame Medusa, the orphan girl Penny, her teddy bear \"Teddy\" and the Devil\\'s Eye diamond. Exactly 1,977 of these sculptures were made, in reference to the film\\'s release year, 1977. The sculpture was priced at $299 and instantly declared retired in 2003.[49]\\n In November 2008, a sixth sculpture inspired by the film was released. Made with pewter and resin, Cleared For Take Off introduced the character of Orville into the collection and featured Bernard and Bianca a second time. The piece, inspired by Orville\\'s take-off scene in the film, was sculpted by Ruben Procopio.[50]\\n The Rescuers premiered on VHS and LaserDisc on September 18, 1992 as part of the Walt Disney Classics series. The release went into moratorium on April 30, 1993.[51] It was re-released on VHS as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection on January 5, 1999, but due to a scandal was recalled three days later and reissued on March 23, 1999.\\n The Rescuers was released on DVD on May 20, 2003, as a standard edition, which was discontinued in November 2011.[citation needed]\\n On August 21, 2012, a 35th-anniversary edition of The Rescuers was released on Blu-ray alongside its sequel in a \"2-Movie Collection\".[52][53]\\n On January 8, 1999, three days after the film\\'s second release on home video, The Walt Disney Company announced a recall of about 3.4 million copies of the videotapes because there was a blurry image of a topless woman in the background of a scene.[54][55][56][57]\\n The image appears twice in non-consecutive frames during the scene in which Miss Bianca and Bernard are flying on Orville\\'s back through New York City. The two images could not be seen in ordinary viewing because the film runs too fast—at 24 frames per second.[58]\\n \\nOn January 10, 1999, two days after the recall was announced, the London newspaper The Independent reported: A Disney spokeswoman said that the images in The Rescuers were placed in the film during post-production, but she declined to say what they were or who placed them... The company said the aim of the recall was to keep its promise to families that they can trust and rely on the Disney brand to provide the best in family entertainment.[59] The Rescuers home video was reissued on March 23, 1999, with the nudity edited and blocked out.[citation needed]\\n The Rescuers was said to be Disney\\'s greatest film since Mary Poppins (1964), and seemed to signal a new golden age for Disney animation.[60] Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times praised the film as \"the best feature-length animated film from Disney in a decade or more—the funniest, the most inventive, the least self-conscious, the most coherent, and moving from start to finish, and probably most important of all, it is also the most touching in that unique way fantasy has of carrying vibrations of real life and real feelings.\"[61] Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote the film \"is one of the most rousing and appealing animated features ever made by the Disney studio. The last production for several members of the original feature animation unit assembled by Walt Disney in the late \\'30s, the film is both a triumphant swan song and gladdening act of regeneration.\"[62] Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader praised the film as \"a beautifully crafted and wonderfully expressive cartoon feature,\" calling it \"genuinely funny and touching.\"[63] Variety magazine wrote the film was \"the best work by Disney animators in many years, restoring the craft to its former glories. In addition, it has a more adventurous approach to color and background stylization than previous Disney efforts have displayed, with a delicate pastel palette used to wide-ranging effect.\"[64]\\n Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the film \"doesn\\'t belong in the same category as the great Disney cartoon features (Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs, Bambi, Fantasia) but it\\'s a reminder of a kind of slickly cheerful, animated entertainment that has become all but extinct.\"[65] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four writing, \"To see any Disney animated film these days is to compare it with Disney classics released 30 or 40 years ago. Judged against Pinocchio, for example. The Rescuers is lightweight, indeed. Its themes are forgettable. It\\'s mostly an adventure story.\"[38] TV Guide gave the film three stars out of five, opining that The Rescuers \"is a beautifully animated film that showed Disney still knew a lot about making quality children\\'s fare even as their track record was weakening.\" They also praised the voice acting of the characters, and stated that the film is \"a delight for children as well as adults who appreciate good animation and brisk storytelling.\"[66] Ellen MacKay of Common Sense Media gave the film four out of five stars, writing, \"Great adventure, but too dark for preschoolers\".[67]\\n In his book, The Disney Films, film historian Leonard Maltin referred to The Rescuers as \"a breath of fresh air for everyone who had been concerned about the future of animation at Walt Disney\\'s,\" praises its \"humor and imagination and [that it is] expertly woven into a solid story structure ... with a delightful cast of characters.\" Finally, he declares the film \"the most satisfying animated feature to come from the studio since 101 Dalmatians.\" He also briefly mentions the ease with which the film surpassed other animated films of its time.[68] The film\\'s own animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston stated on their website that The Rescuers had been their return to a film with heart and also considered it their best film without Walt Disney.[69] The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received a 79% approval rating, with an average rating of 6.5/10 based on 33 reviews. The website\\'s consensus states: \"Featuring superlative animation, off-kilter characters, and affectionate voice work by Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor, The Rescuers represents a bright spot in Disney\\'s post-golden age.\"[70] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100 based on 8 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[71]\\n In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated The Rescuers for its Top 10 Animated Films list.[74]\\n Bernard and Bianca made appearances as meet-and-greet characters at Walt Disney World and Disneyland in the years following the original film\\'s release. While they currently do not make regular appearances at the American parks, both continue to appear regularly at Tokyo Disney Resort.[citation needed]\\n Like other Disney animated characters, the characters of the film have recurring cameo appearances in the television series House of Mouse.\\n In the Disney Infinity video games, Medusa\\'s Swamp Mobile was introduced as a vehicle in Disney Infinity 2.0.[75]\\n In the world builder video game Disney Magic Kingdoms, Bernard, Miss Bianca, Penny, Madame Medusa, and Orville appear as playable characters in the main storyline of the game, along with The Rescue Aid Society and Madame Medusa\\'s Riverboat as attractions.[76][77][78]\\n Along with other Walt Disney Animation Studios characters, the main characters of the film have cameo appearances in the short film Once Upon a Studio.[79]\\n The Rescuers was the first Disney animated film to have a sequel. After three successful theatrical releases of the original film, The Rescuers Down Under was released theatrically on November 16, 1990.\\n The Rescuers Down Under takes place in the Australian Outback, and involves Bernard and Bianca trying to rescue a boy named Cody and a giant golden eagle called Marahute from a greedy poacher named Percival C. McLeach. Both Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor reprised their lead roles. Since Jim Jordan, who had voiced Orville, had since died, a new character, Wilbur (Orville\\'s brother, another albatross), was created and voiced by John Candy.', 'Tinker Bell is a fictional character from J. M. Barrie\\'s 1904 play Peter Pan and its 1911 novelisation Peter and Wendy. She has appeared in a variety of film and television adaptations of the Peter Pan stories, in particular the 1953 animated Walt Disney picture Peter Pan. She also appears in the official 2006 sequel Peter Pan in Scarlet by Geraldine McCaughrean commissioned by Great Ormond Street Hospital as well as the \"Peter and the Starcatchers\" book series by Ridley Pearson and Dave Barry. \\n At first only a supporting character described by her creator as \"a common fairy\", her animated incarnation was a hit and has since become a widely recognized unofficial mascot of The Walt Disney Company, next to the official mascot of Mickey Mouse.\\n Barrie described Tinker Bell as a fairy who mended pots and kettles, an actual tinker of the fairy folk.[1] Her speech consists of the sounds of a tinkling bell, which is understandable only to those familiar with the language of the fairies.\\n Though sometimes ill-tempered, jealous, vindictive and inquisitive, she is also helpful and kind to Peter.[2] The extremes in her personality are explained in the story by the fact that a fairy\\'s size prevents her from holding more than one feeling at a time, so when she is angry she has no counterbalancing compassion. At the end of the novel, when Peter flies back to find an older Wendy, \"when she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he said, \\'Who is Tinker Bell?\\'\" Try as she might, nothing she said helped Peter remember Tinker Bell. Finally, Peter said, \\'There are such a lot of them, I expect she is no more.\\' The narrator comments that he expected Peter was right, \"that fairies don\\'t live long, but they are so little that a short time seems a good while to them.\" \\n In the first draft of the play, she is called Tippy-toe, but became Tinker Bell in the later drafts and final version.[3]\\n In the original stage productions, Tinker Bell was represented on stage by a darting light \"created by a small mirror held in the hand off-stage and reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp\",[4] and her voice was \"a collar of bells and two special ones that Barrie brought from Switzerland\".[5] However, a \\'Jane (or Jenny) Wren\\' was listed among the cast on the programmes as playing Tinker Bell; this was a joke which also helped with the mystique of the fairy character and fooled H.M. Inspector of Taxes, who sent Jane Wren a tax demand.[5]\\n Originally, no fairy dust was mentioned in the play, but Barrie added to the script the necessity to sprinkle it to enable the children to fly because \"so many children tried [to fly] from their beds and needed surgical attention.\"[6]\\n In the  musical version of the play, she was also represented by a darting light, accompanied by a celesta. Her favourite insult (as in Barrie\\'s play) is \"You silly ass!\", which the audience learns to recognise because it is always represented by the same motif: four notes (presumably one for each syllable of the phrase), followed by a growl on the bassoon.\\n Film adaptations provided the first vocal effects for the character, whether through sound, such as musical expressions or the sound of a tinkling bell, or human speech.\\n In the 1924 film, Tinker Bell was played by Virginia Browne Faire.\\n In the 1991 film Hook, Tinker Bell is portrayed by Julia Roberts. After taking the now-adult Peter to Neverland to rescue his children, Tinker Bell persuades Captain Hook to give her three days to restore Peter\\'s lost memories (including his abilities to fly, fight, and crow) in order to ensure a fair fight between Peter and Hook. After Peter\\'s memory is restored, Tinker Bell \"wishes\" herself into a human-size woman to share a kiss with Peter. After Peter returns to London, Tinker Bell appears to him one last time on the Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens to tell him that she will always love him.\\n In this version, Tinker Bell is portrayed as a winged, six-inch-tall tomboyish sprite with a red \"pixie cut\" hairstyle. She wears a ragged leather tunic with matching shorts and carries a dagger strapped to her leg. Only while flying does she appear as the traditional ball of light. Tinker Bell displays strength beyond all proportion to her size and is capable of picking up and carrying a grown man, as well as wielding a human sword while flying (giving the impression that the sword is hovering in mid-air). This is also the first interpretation in which Tinker Bell has the ability to transform into a human-size version of herself. Hook subverts Tinker Bell\\'s canon by having her survive well into the modern era, whereas the original novel states that fairies are naturally short-lived. The implication of the novel was that Tinker Bell died shortly after the Darling children\\'s adventures, and that Peter forgot her.\\n In the 2003 film Peter Pan, P.J. Hogan originally planned to use a computer-generated version of the character, but instead used Ludivine Sagnier in combination with digital models and effects to take advantage of the actress\\'s expressions.\\n In the 2023 film Peter Pan & Wendy, Yara Shahidi portrayed Tinker Bell. This marked the first time a person of color portrayed the character, who had been previously portrayed by white actors. This adaptation followed in the footsteps of Disney\\'s casting of the African American actress Halle Bailey to play Ariel in The Little Mermaid (2023).\\n Tinker Bell will appear in the 2025 horror film Peter Pan\\'s Neverland Nightmare which will portray her as a human instead of a fairy. This version who is addicted to heroin, whilst mistaking it for fairy dust.  She and Captain Hook will be helping Peter Pan kidnap kids.[7]\\n Tinker Bell returns in the official sequel Peter Pan in Scarlet. When Wendy and the rest of the group reach Neverland and ask Peter where she is, he replies that he does not know anyone by the name Tinker Bell, which is explained as him not remembering her after she died. She is mentioned by Wendy and the rest of the Lost Boys to Fireflyer, a silly blue fairy, who when he reaches the top of Neverpeak, makes the wish to meet her. When they open Captain Hook\\'s treasure chest, among other things, Tinker Bell is seen inside it to Fireflyer\\'s joy. Initially, Tinker Bell does not like him, but eventually she comes to see that Fireflyer is not as bad as he seems to be. In the end, they get married and start selling dreams to the Roamers, previous Lost Boys that have been outcast by Peter, while having many adventures.\\n In the Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson Peter and the Starcatchers book series, Tinker Bell makes her first appearance at the end of the first novel. Originally, she was a green and yellow coloured bird who was put in a bag of starstuff, turning her into a fairy. Molly\\'s father, the famous starcatcher Lord Leonard Aster, made her Peter\\'s guardian and she follows him on all of his adventures. She doesn\\'t like being called a fairy and would much rather be called \"birdwoman\" because of her origins. She is very protective of Peter, and hates his paying attention to any other female. She can be very impolite to others (only Peter is able to understand her perfectly, and most of the time he does not reveal what she says about others, because they are mostly insults). She is also able to emit a very bright light, which she uses as an attack against other creatures, especially Lord Ombra, one of the main villains of the series.\\n In the Andy Weir and Sarah Andersen Cheshire Crossing series, Tinker \"Tink\" Bell firstly appears alongside Peter as they attempt to rescue captured fairies from Captain Hook and the Wicked Witch of the West, with Peter being captured and Tink fleeing to get Wendy\\'s help, alongside that of Dorothy Gale and Alice Liddell, providing the latter two with fairy dust to fly. Later, after Dorothy is captured, Tink frees her and goes to Castle West to warn Jack the Knave of Hearts of the incoming flying pirate ship, preventing the Cheshire Cat from eating her when they attempt to do so. Later, after the Witch defeats Mary Poppins in battle, Tink lends Poppins her power against the Witch as Poppins utters \"Say hello to my little friend!\", leaving them evenly matched. Later, after the Witch has been defeated, Alice places Peter (now shrunken to Tink\\'s size and having matured due to consuming size-altering berries in Wonderland) next to Tink, having recognized her as being in love with him, and after being complimented by Peter as to her appearance, the pair kiss.\\n In the book by Kirk Clendinning, Coira in Everland, Tinker \"Tink\" Bell has isolated herself from the other fairies and girls in Everland, partly due to her anger and humiliation with Pan, deep in the forest within a hollow tree. Coira, who has lost her dream pool, and so too is estranged from the community, finds Tinker Bell and they become fast friends, sharing Pan-like adventures together. When the Mairbh Queen threatens to destroy Everland by enslaving fairies and children to gather nectar so that she can make enough fairy dust to escape from Everland, Tink, Coira, a mauve fairy named Chandler and mysterious boy work together to defeat her and restore Everland to normalcy.\\n Tinker Bell was voiced or portrayed by:\\n In World of Winx, Tinker Bell is a powerful fairy from the world of dreams (also called Neverland) and a friend of Peter Pan. When Peter Pan eventually left her for Wendy Darling, she became dark and cold, turning into the evil Queen.\\n In addition to the illustrations in the original editions of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell has also been depicted by fantasy artists such as Brian Froud and Myrea Pettit. She also appears in the edition of Peter Pan in Scarlet illustrated by David Wyatt.\\n A bronze sculpture of Tinker Bell by London artist Diarmuid Byron O\\'Connor was commissioned by Great Ormond Street Hospital, to whom Barrie bequeathed the copyright to the character, to be added to his original four-foot statue of Peter Pan, wresting a thimble from Peter\\'s finger. The figure has a 9.5\\xa0in (240\\xa0mm) wingspan and is 7\\xa0in (180\\xa0mm) tall. She was unveiled on 29 September 2005 by Sophie, Countess of Wessex. \\n In 2009, a waxwork of Tinker Bell (the museum\\'s \"smallest figure of all time\" at 5.5\\xa0in (140\\xa0mm) was created at Madame Tussauds, London.[9]\\n Five people individually played Tinker Bell at Disneyland California from 1961 to 2005. Multiple alternate people, women and men, were playing the role at Walt Disney World in Florida and Disneyland after 2005. Tinker Bell didn\\'t start flying in Florida until 1985.', 'Brother Bear is a 2003 American animated musical fantasy comedy-drama film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Aaron Blaise and Robert Walker (in their feature directorial debuts) and produced by Chuck Williams, from a screenplay written by Tab Murphy, Lorne Cameron, David Hoselton, and the writing team of Steve Bencich and Ron J. Friedman. The film stars the voices of Joaquin Phoenix, Jeremy Suarez, Rick Moranis, Dave Thomas, Jason Raize (in his only film role), and D.B. Sweeney. Brother Bear follows an Alaska native boy named Kenai who kills a grizzly bear as retribution for his older brother\\'s death. The Great Spirits, incensed by the unnecessary killing, transform Kenai into a bear himself as punishment.[3] In order to become human again, Kenai travels to a mountain where the Northern lights touch the earth, forging a relationship with a cub named Koda along the way.\\n The film was the third and final Disney animated feature produced primarily by the Feature Animation studio at Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida; the studio was shut down in March 2004, not long after the release of this film in favor of computer-animated features. Brother Bear was released in the United States on November 1, 2003, to mixed reviews from critics and received a nomination for Best Animated Feature at the 76th Academy Awards, losing to Pixar\\'s Finding Nemo. The film grossed $250 million against a $46 million budget. A direct-to-video sequel, Brother Bear 2, was released on August 29, 2006.\\n In a post-ice age Alaska, the local tribes believe all creatures are created through the Great Spirits, who are said to appear in the form of an aurora. A trio of brothers, Kenai, the youngest; Denahi, the middle; and Sitka, the eldest, return to their tribe for Kenai to receive his totem, necklaces in the shapes of different animals, from Tanana, the shaman of the brothers\\' tribe. The particular animals they represent symbolize what they must achieve to call themselves men.\\n Unlike Sitka, who gained the eagle of guidance, and Denahi, who gained the wolf of wisdom, Kenai receives the bear of love. He objects to his totem, stating that bears are thieves and dumb creatures without feelings, and believes his point is made a fact when a brown bear steals their basket of salmon, which Kenai did not hold properly in a hurry to receive his totem. Kenai searches for the basket and finds it destroyed. He sees the bear, provokes it, his brothers find him, and a fight ends on top of a giant glacier. When the bear gets the upper hand, Sitka gives his life to save his brothers by dislodging the glacier, although the bear survives the fall. After Sitka\\'s funeral, an enraged Kenai blames the bear for Sitka\\'s death and rejects his totem. He hunts down and chases the bear up onto a rocky cliff, fighting and eventually slaying it. The Spirits, represented by Sitka\\'s spirit in the form of a bald eagle, arrive and transform Kenai into a bear after the dead bear\\'s body evaporates and joins them. Denahi arrives and falsely believes that Kenai was killed by the bear from earlier. Kenai falls off the cliff and down some rapids, but survives.  Denahi vows to avenge Kenai.\\n Kenai awakens as he is healed by Tanana and discovers to his horror that he has become a bear. Tanana cannot understand Kenai, but advises him to go to the mountain where the lights touch the earth to find Sitka and be turned back into a human, but only when he atones for his actions; she vanishes without an explanation. Kenai quickly discovers that the wildlife can now speak to him, meeting a pair of moose brothers named Rutt and Tuke. He gets caught in a trap but is freed by an outgoing bear cub named Koda. After they evade Denahi, who is still unaware that the bear he\\'s pursuing is Kenai, Koda reveals to Kenai that his mother is missing. They make a deal: Kenai will escort Koda to an annual salmon run, and then the cub will lead Kenai to the mountain nearby. Along the way, the two form a brother-like relationship and are joined by Rutt and Tuke and ride on the backs of a woolly mammoth herd. Kenai and Koda eventually continue their journey on foot. As they go through a volcanic field, Kenai and Koda are still hunted by Denahi as he is determined to avenge Kenai.\\n Kenai and Koda reach the salmon run, where a large number of bears live as a family, including the leader Tug. Kenai accepts his new surroundings and is comfortable living with the other bears. During story time among the bears, Koda tells a story about his mother recently fighting human hunters on a glacier, reminding Kenai of his and his brothers\\' fight with the bear that led to Sitka\\'s death, making him realize that the bear he killed was Koda\\'s mother. Horrified of what he has done, Kenai runs away in a fit of guilt, but Koda soon follows him. Downhearted, Kenai confesses the truth to Koda, who runs away, grief-stricken that Kenai was responsible for his mother\\'s death. An remorseful Kenai leaves to go to the mountain.\\n Meanwhile, Rutt and Tuke, having had a falling out, reconcile in front of Koda, prompting him to forgive Kenai. On the mountain, Kenai is cornered by Denahi, but their battle is interrupted by Koda, who steals Denahi\\'s spear. Kenai comes to Koda\\'s aid, out of love, prompting Sitka to appear and turn him back into a human, much to Denahi and Koda\\'s surprise. However, upon realizing that Koda needs him because of his own mistake, Kenai asks Sitka to transform him back into a bear with Denahi\\'s support. Sitka complies, and Kenai is transformed back into a bear. Koda is reunited briefly with the spirit of his mother before she and Sitka return to the spirit world. In the end, Kenai lives with the rest of the bears and gains his title as a man, through being a bear.\\n Additional vocals by Patrick Pinney, Bob Bergen, Rodger Bumpass, Roger Rose, Debi Derryberry, Randy Crenshaw, Phil Proctor, John Schwab, Bill Farmer, Pamela Adlon, Hope Levy, and Sherry Lynn.\\n Following the critical and commercial success of The Lion King (1994), then-Disney chairman and CEO Michael Eisner urged for more animal-centric animated features. He suggested a North American setting, taking particular inspiration from an original landscape painting by Albert Bierstadt that he purchased. For the characters, the hero would be a bear, the king of the forest.[5] At the time, the original idea, which was inspired by King Lear, centered around an old blind bear who traveled the forest with his three daughters.[6] In 1997, veteran animator Aaron Blaise joined the project as director because he \"wanted to be attached so that [he] could animate bears\",[7] and was soon joined by co-director Robert Walker.[8] Because Blaise desired a more naturalistic story, Blaise and producer Chuck Williams produced a two-page treatment of a father-son story in which the son is transformed into a bear, and in the end, remains a bear. Thomas Schumacher, then-president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, approved the revised story and proclaimed, \"This is the idea of the century.\"[5] Tab Murphy, who had co-written the screenplays for The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), Tarzan (1999), and Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001), came on board to write an early draft of the script.[8]\\n After the project was green-lit, Blaise,  Walker, and the story artists embarked on a research trip in August 1999 to visit Alaska where they traveled on the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes and Kodiak Island.[5] They also traveled through Denali National Park and the Kenai Fjords National Park, where they visited Exit and Holgate Glacier.[9] A year later, the production team took additional research trips through the Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and the Sequoia National Park.[5] Around 2000, the story evolved into a tale in which the transformed Kenai is taken in by an older bear, Grizz, who was to be voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan.[10] However, Blaise explained that \"we were struggling [with the story], trying to get some charm into the film. So we turned Grizz into a cub named Koda\",[7] who was voiced by Jeremy Suarez. Because Blaise, Walker, and Williams enjoyed Duncan\\'s vocal performance, Tug, the de facto leader of the bears at the salmon run, was written into the film.[10]\\n In March 2001, Joaquin Phoenix confirmed he was cast in the film, exclaiming, \"Oh, but forget the Oscar nomination (for Gladiator). The real pinnacle is that I\\'m playing an animated character in a Disney film. Isn\\'t that the greatest? I play a Native American transformed into a bear. It\\'s called The Bears. Don\\'t call me a leading man. I don\\'t care about that. I\\'m a leading bear. I am content!\"[11] After the filmmakers heard his audition tapes for Finding Nemo (2003), Jeremy Suarez was cast as Koda.[5]\\n As is typical for animation voice acting, Suarez and Phoenix voiced their roles separately, although they both did a recording session together at least two times.[5] Voicing the moose brothers Rutt and Tuke, Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis performed simultaneously throughout the recording process.[5] Angayuqaq Oscar Kawagley, an associate professor who taught courses on Alaska Native philosophy at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, claimed he was never given a script, but was instead given \"the dialogue that they had written, which was being told by a Native person\". For his role as the Inuit Narrator, Kawagley translated the dialogue in written form into Yup\\'ik and faxed the translation back to the Disney studio. He later recorded his translation at an Anchorage studio while being videotaped for animation reference.[12]\\n The film is traditionally animated but includes some CG elements such as \"a salmon run and a caribou stampede\".[13] Layout artist Armand Serrano, speaking about the drawing process on the film, said that \"we had to do a life drawing session with live bear cubs and also outdoor drawing and painting sessions at Fort Wilderness in Florida three times a week for two months [...]\".[citation needed]. In 2001, Background supervisor Barry Kooser and his team traveled to Jackson Hole, Wyoming and studied with Western landscape painter Scott Christensen, where they learned to: \"simplify objects by getting the spatial dimensions to work first and working in the detail later.\"\\n According to Ruben Aquino, supervising animator for the character of Denahi, Denahi was originally meant to be Kenai\\'s father; later this was changed to Kenai\\'s brother.[14] Byron Howard, supervising animator for Kenai in bear form, said that earlier in production a bear named Grizz (who resembles Tug in the film and is voiced by the same actor) was supposed to have the role of Kenai\\'s mentor.[15] Art Director Robh Ruppel stated that the ending of the film originally showed how Kenai and Denahi get together once a year to play when the northern lights are in the sky.[15]\\n Following the success of the Tarzan soundtrack, Phil Collins was offered the opportunity to compose songs for Brother Bear, as well as let him \"co-write the score\".[16] However, Collins explained, \"Slowly, the bad news started to trickle down that I wouldn\\'t be singing it all. It was a bit of a disappointment, because I [usually] write songs that I sing myself.\"[17] While Collins composed six songs for the film, he shared vocal performance duties with Tina Turner, who sang the opening song;[18] the Blind Boys Of Alabama and the Bulgarian Women\\'s Choir, who performed the song, \"Transformation\". Collins\\'s lyrics for the song were first translated into Iñupiaq. The performance was then arranged by score co-composers Collins and Mark Mancina, and vocal arranger Eddie Jobson.[19]\\n Brother Bear was originally slated for a spring 2004 release, while Home on the Range was scheduled for an autumn 2003 release.[20][21] However, Disney announced that Brother Bear would be released in fall 2003 while Home on the Range was pushed back for a spring 2004 release. Contrary to speculation, news writer Jim Hill stated the release date switch was not because Home on the Range was suffering from story rewrites, but to promote Brother Bear on the Platinum Edition release of The Lion King.[22] On July 15, 2003, Disney announced that the release date would be moved up by one weekend from its previously scheduled slot of November 7, 2003. However, instead of opening on Halloween, the film would be released on Saturday, November 1, 2003.[23]\\n On October 20, 2003, Brother Bear premiered at the New Amsterdam Theatre, where fellow attendees included New York Governor George Pataki and cast members Michael Clarke Duncan and Estelle Harris. Following the screening of the film, Collins performed the song \"No Way Out\" before introducing Tina Turner to the stage where she performed the opening song, \"Great Spirits\".[24]\\n Brother Bear was released on VHS and DVD on March 30, 2004. The DVD release consisted of two separate discs, which were both THX-certified. The first disc contained the widescreen version (1.66:1 aspect ratio) and the second disc featured the original theatrical widescreen version (1.66:1 and 2.35:1 aspect ratio). The DVD also included a documentary on the production of the film, an audio commentary track by Rutt and Tuke with an option for visual mode, an artwork gallery narrated by the artists, three deleted scenes, two games called \"Find Your Totem\" and \"Bone Puzzle\", and two music videos with Phil Collins.[25][26] By January 2005, the film had earned $169 million in home video sales and rentals.[27] In April 2004 alone, 5.51 million DVD copies of the film were sold.[28]\\n The film was released in a Blu-ray special edition combined with its sequel, Brother Bear 2, on March 12, 2013.[29]\\n Disney\\'s Brother Bear games were released in November 2003 for Game Boy Advance, PC and mobile phones.\\n Brother Bear received mixed reviews from critics.[30][31] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 37% of 131 critics\\' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"Brother Bear is gentle and pleasant if unremarkable Disney fare, with so-so animation and generic plotting.\"[32] Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 48 based on 28 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[33] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[34]\\n On the syndicated television show At the Movies, film critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper both gave the film positive reviews. In his print review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert wrote the film \"doesn\\'t have the zowie factor of The Lion King or Finding Nemo, but is sweet rather than exciting. Children and their parents are likely to relate on completely different levels, the adults connecting with the transfer of souls from man to beast, while the kids are excited by the adventure stuff.\"[35] USA Today film critic Claudia Puig gave the film three out of four stars praising the film for its \"message of tolerance and respect for nature rings loud and clear. And family audiences are treated to a vibrantly hued movie with appealing characters.\"[36] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \"a playful movie that celebrates nature and the spirit world with striking imagery and a smooth blend of drama and comedy.\"[37]\\n Writing for Variety, Todd McCarthy summarized that \"Brother Bear is a very mild animated entry from Disney with a distinctly recycled feel [because] the film\\'s characters and narrative simply fail to engage strong interest, and tale is probably too resolutely serious to enchant small fry in the way the better Disney titles always have.\"[38] Kenneth Turan, reviewing for the Los Angeles Times, complimented \"the richness and fluidity of its visuals\" and the \"satisfying ending\", but derided that \"Brother Bear has an appeal that can\\'t be denied. Too often, however, this film\\'s lack of a fresh dramatic approach and not its technique makes it difficult to embrace as much as we\\'d like to\".[39] Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt the film was too similar to The Lion King. He later wrote: \"This opulent movie, with gorgeous rainbow animation, is heavy on message but light on humor.\"[40]\\n Many critics and audiences also noted the use of the film\\'s aspect ratio as a storytelling device. The film begins at a standard widescreen aspect ratio of 1.75:1 (similar to the 1.85:1 ratio common in U.S. cinema or the 1.78:1 ratio of HDTV), while Kenai is a human; in addition, the film\\'s art direction and color scheme are grounded in realism. After Kenai transforms into a bear twenty-four minutes into the picture, the film itself transforms as well: to an anamorphic aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and towards brighter, more fanciful colors and slightly more caricatured art direction. Brother Bear was the first feature since The Horse Whisperer to do a widescreen shift. It was the only animated film to feature this technique, until The Simpsons Movie and Enchanted in 2007.\\n In its limited release, Brother Bear played only in two selected theaters in Los Angeles, California and New York City, grossing $291,940 for a per-screen average of $145,970.[41][42] The wide release followed on November 1, 2003, expanding to 3,030 theater venues. The film opened second behind Scary Movie 3 grossing $18.5 million at the box office.[43] On its second wide weekend, the film continued its strong showing grossing $18.6 million against new competing films such as Elf and The Matrix Revolutions, collecting $44.1 million in three weeks.[44] The film grossed $85.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $165.1 million in international territories, bringing its worldwide total to $250.4 million.[2]\\n The song \"Welcome\" written by Phil Collins was later used as the theme song for Walt Disney\\'s Parade of Dreams during the Happiest Homecoming on Earth, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Disneyland. For the parade, the song had slightly changed lyrics and was performed by an ensemble.\\n Disney Television Animation was set to produce a television series titled Brother Bear: The Series for Disney Channel. The Simpsons veteran Pete Michels was to helm the series and was allowed to watch a copy of the film so that he could construct a pilot. The series would have taken place directly after the events of the film and would have seen Kenai and Koda adopt other orphaned animals into their family. Jeremy Suarez, Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas were to reprise their respective roles while Will Friedle would have replaced Joaquin Phoenix as Kenai. While the pilot tested well, it was not picked up as Disney Channel executives felt that adapting the film as a series was \"counterproductive\" to their goal of trying to reach a tween audience, combined with the fact that the movie performed below expectations.[45]\\n A direct-to-video sequel called Brother Bear 2 was released on August 29, 2006. It focuses on the continued adventures of bear brothers Kenai and Koda. While the first film dealt with Kenai\\'s relationship with Koda, this one focuses more on his bond with a young human of his past, Nita.\\n A video game of same name was released by Disney as a tie-in to the film. It was released for Game Boy Advance, November 21 for Microsoft Windows, and for mobile phones.', 'Lilo & Stitch is a 2002 American animated science fiction comedy drama film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures.[3][4] It was written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois (in their feature directorial debuts) and produced by Clark Spencer, based on an original story created by Sanders. It stars Daveigh Chase and Sanders as the voices of the title characters, with the voices of Tia Carrere, David Ogden Stiers, Kevin McDonald, Ving Rhames, Jason Scott Lee, Zoe Caldwell, and Kevin Michael Richardson in supporting roles. It was the second of three Disney animated feature films produced primarily at the Florida animation studio in Disney-MGM Studios at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida.[5][d]\\n The film tells the story of two individuals: an orphaned Hawaiian girl named Lilo Pelekai, who is raised by her struggling older sister, Nani, after their parents\\' deaths, and the genetically engineered extraterrestrial creature Experiment 626, who Lilo adopts as her \"dog\" and renames \"Stitch\". Stitch, who was designed to cause chaos and destruction, initially uses Lilo to avoid recapture by an intergalactic federation. They develop a close bond through the Hawaiian concept of ʻohana, or extended family, causing Stitch to reconsider his intended destructive purpose in order to keep his newfound family together.\\n The film is based on an idea by Sanders, who originally conceived Stitch in 1985, and the film\\'s design and aesthetics are based on his personal art style. Stitch was initially at the center of a children\\'s book Sanders had conceptualized, but later abandoned. A feature-length film starring the character entered development in 1997 when Thomas Schumacher, then the president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, approached Sanders with the objective of \"producing the Dumbo for our generation.\" The use of watercolor backgrounds hearkened back to early Disney productions such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). The film and its accompanying soundtrack made extensive use of the music of Elvis Presley, while Alan Silvestri composed the film\\'s score.\\n Lilo & Stitch premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on June 16, 2002, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 21. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised its story, humor, charm, and originality. Produced on an $80 million budget and promoted with a marketing campaign that played up its oddities, it was a box-office success, grossing over $273 million worldwide. It was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards but lost to Spirited Away.[6][7] The film\\'s success made it a highlight of Disney\\'s post-animation renaissance era in the 2000s, spawning a franchise that includes three direct-to-video film sequels and three television series. A live-action adaptation is set to be released in 2025.\\n On planet Turo, the United Galactic Federation convicts scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba of illegal genetic experimentation; he has created Experiment 626, an aggressive and near-indestructible creature with great learning capabilities. 626 is sentenced to exile on a desert asteroid, but he escapes and hijacks a space cruiser that crash-lands on Kauaʻi, Hawaii, on the planet Earth. Shortly after landing on Earth, 626 is hit by three passing trucks and taken to an animal shelter. The Federation\\'s Grand Councilwoman offers Jumba an early release if he retrieves 626 with the assistance of the council\\'s Earth expert, Agent Pleakley.\\n On Kauaʻi, orphaned teenager Nani Pelekai struggles to take care of her lonely, rambunctious younger sister, Lilo, following their parents\\' death in a car crash. Social worker Cobra Bubbles doubts Nani can be an adequate guardian for Lilo and threatens to place Lilo in foster care if the Pelekais\\' situation fails to improve. After overhearing Lilo wishing to have a friend, Nani brings her to the animal shelter to adopt a dog. Lilo adopts 626, who is impersonating a dog, and names him \"Stitch\". That night, Stitch causes chaos at the lūʻau where Nani works while trying to avoid capture by Jumba and Pleakley. Nani\\'s boss blames Nani for the chaos, and she is fired. The news of Nani\\'s unemployment reaches Bubbles, who orders Nani to find a new job and tells Lilo to teach Stitch to be a \"model citizen\".\\n Despite Lilo\\'s attempts to domesticate Stitch, his antics repeatedly ruin Nani\\'s efforts to find a new job. While Nani, Lilo, and Stitch go surfing with Nani\\'s former co-worker and friend David, Jumba and Pleakley again attempt to capture Stitch and unintentionally drag Lilo underwater in the process. David rescues Lilo and Stitch, but Bubbles, having observed the mishap, tells Nani he will retrieve Lilo the following morning. Feeling guilty for causing so much trouble, Stitch runs away. The Grand Councilwoman fires Jumba and Pleakley and tasks her second-in-command, Captain Gantu, with capturing Stitch, while Jumba begins hunting Stitch using less covert methods. When David informs Nani of another job opportunity, Nani leaves Lilo at home alone. Jumba and Pleakley chase Stitch back to the Pelekais\\' house. The ensuing fight between Jumba and Stitch culminates in an explosion that destroys the house.\\n Nani gets the job but frantically returns home after seeing a fire engine driving toward her house. Bubbles arrives to retrieve Lilo. While Bubbles and Nani argue about Lilo\\'s well-being, Lilo runs away into the woods and encounters Stitch, who reveals his alien identity just moments before Gantu captures them both. Stitch manages to escape just as Gantu\\'s ship takes off. Nani confronts Stitch, but Jumba and Pleakley immediately capture him. Nani asks them to save Lilo, but they insist they only have legal authority to capture Stitch. After Nani bursts into tears, Stitch remembers ʻohana, a term for \"family\" he learned from Lilo, and convinces Jumba to help rescue her. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani board Jumba\\'s spaceship, pursue Gantu and rescue Lilo.\\n The Grand Councilwoman arrives to retrieve Stitch herself. She fires Gantu for endangering Lilo and failing to capture Stitch. However, after observing Stitch\\'s civilized behavior and being informed that Lilo legally owns Stitch because she bought him at the animal shelter, the Grand Councilwoman decrees that Stitch will live out his exile on Earth and that the Pelekai family has the protection of the United Galactic Federation. Bubbles reveals he is a former CIA agent who had previously met the Grand Councilwoman in Roswell, New Mexico in 1973. Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley, having joined Lilo and Nani\\'s family, rebuild their house with David and Bubbles\\' help.\\n In 1985, after graduating from California Institute of the Arts, Chris Sanders had created the character of Stitch for an unsuccessful children\\'s book pitch.[8] He said, \"I wanted to do a children\\'s book about this little creature that lived in a forest. It was a bit of a monster with no real explanation as to where it came from.\" But he found it difficult to condense the story and abandoned the project.[9] In 1987, Walt Disney Feature Animation hired him for their newly formed visual development department. His first project was The Rescuers Down Under (1990), but he soon transitioned into storyboarding.[10] After that, Sanders storyboarded sequences for Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994), and was promoted to Head of Story on Mulan (1998).[11]\\n In 1997, several executives at Disney Feature Animation were invited to a retreat at Michael Eisner\\'s farm in Vermont to discuss the future animation slate beyond adapting preexisting legends, folklore or classic novels.[12] At the retreat, Thomas Schumacher, then executive vice president of Disney Feature Animation, suggested they produce a film that would be the \"Dumbo for our generation\", compared to the large-budget Disney animated features they had already done.[8] Schumacher approached Sanders about producing the film, telling him: \"Everybody wants this next film to be you.\"[9]\\n During a karaoke dinner at the Walt Disney World Swan Resort, Schumacher asked Sanders, \"Is there anything you would like to develop?\" Sanders remembered the children\\'s book project he had initially developed.[13] At his next meeting, Sanders pitched a remote, non-urban location, with Stitch crash-landing into a forest and interacting entirely with woodland animals, being ostracized by them, and living on his own at a farm in rural Kansas.[14] But Schumacher suggested that Stitch should interact with people instead: \"The animal world is already alien to us. So, if you wanna get the best contrast between this monster and the place where it lives, I would recommend you set it in a human world.\"[13][15][16] Sanders would eventually, albeit inadvertently, revisit his idea of a creature bonding with animals in a forest years later with The Wild Robot (2024).[17]\\n For three straight days in his Palm Springs, Florida hotel room, Sanders created a 29-page pitch book drawing conceptual sketches and outlining the film\\'s general story.[13] He initially revised it by adding a boy character.[18] But as the character of Stitch evolved, Sanders decided he needed to be contrasted with a female character: \"I think Stitch represented a male character so the balance would be to put him with a little girl. We wanted someone who was going to be in conflict with Stitch, and we realized a little boy might be a comrade.\"[19] Sanders then glanced at a map of Hawaii on his wall, and recalling he had recently vacationed there, he relocated the story there.[8] Not well versed in Hawaiian culture, Sanders turned to a vacation roadmap and found the names \"Lilo Lane\" and \"Nani\" there.[9] After finishing the booklet, he shipped it to Burbank, and Schumacher approved the pitch with one condition: \"it has to look like you drew it.\"[13]\\n \"Animation has been set so much in ancient, medieval Europe\\xa0— so many fairy tales find their roots there, that to place it in Hawaii was kind of a big leap. But that choice went to color the entire movie, and rewrite the story for us.\"\\n —Chris Sanders, reflecting on the location change to Hawaii[15] Dean DeBlois, who had served as \"story co-head\" for Mulan, was brought on to co-write and co-direct Lilo & Stitch after Thomas Schumacher allowed him to leave production on Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001).[20] Meanwhile, Disney executive Clark Spencer was assigned as the film\\'s producer. Unlike several previous and concurrent Disney Feature Animation productions, the film\\'s pre-production team remained relatively small and isolated from upper management until the film went into full production.[21]\\n Originally, Stitch was the leader of an intergalactic gang, and Jumba was one of his former cronies summoned by the Intergalactic Council to capture Stitch.[8] Test audience response to early versions of the film led to changing Stitch and Jumba into creation and creator.[8]\\n While the animation team visited Kauaʻi to research the locale, their tour guide explained the meaning of ʻohana as it applies to extended families. This concept of ʻohana became an important part of the movie. DeBlois recalls:\\n No matter where we went, our tour guide seemed to know somebody. He was really the one who explained to us the Hawaiian concept of ʻohana, a sense of family that extends far beyond your immediate relatives. That idea so influenced the story that it became the foundation theme, the thing that causes Stitch to evolve despite what he was created to do, which is destroy. The island of Kauaʻi had also been featured in such films as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and the Jurassic Park trilogy (1993–2001). Disney\\'s animators faced the daunting task of meshing the film\\'s plot, which showed the impoverished and dysfunctional life that many Hawaiians lived during the then-recent economic downturn, with the island\\'s serene beauty. The actors voicing the film\\'s young adults, Nani and David, were Tia Carrere, a local of Honolulu, and Jason Scott Lee, who is of Hawaiian descent and grew up in Hawaii. Both Carrere and Lee assisted with rewriting their characters\\' dialogue in proper colloquial dialect, and with adding Hawaiian slang terms.[22]\\n One innovative and unique aspect of the film is its strong focus on the relationship between two sisters. At the time, a central relationship between sisters as a major plot element was rare in American animated films.[23]\\n Daveigh Chase earned the role of Lilo in the fall of 1998 against 150 other candidates.[24]\\n Stitch was initially intended to be a non-verbal character, but Sanders said he realized \"he\\'d have to say a few things, so we made sure that we kept it to a minimum.\" Instead of hiring a professional actor to voice Stitch, DeBlois suggested Sanders take the role. According to Sanders, Stitch\\'s voice was the one he regularly used \"just to bother people at the studio. I\\'d call people on the phone and do that voice and annoy them.\"[25]\\n Tia Carrere was originally considered for the title character in Mulan (1998), but lost the role to Ming-Na Wen.[26] After learning Disney was doing a Hawaii-set film, Carrere sought a voice role and was hired to voice Nani.[26] She spent two years recording her part in Los Angeles, Paris, and Toronto.[27] Jason Scott Lee was cast as David after Carrere recommended him for the film.[26]\\n Chris Williams, then a storyboard artist, suggested Kevin McDonald for the part of Agent Pleakley. After McDonald read for the part, he was cast.[9] Cobra Bubbles was initially envisioned as more of a nebbish, with Jeff Goldblum in mind for the role. Goldblum declined the role, and Bubbles was reconceived as a more intimidating character. Sanders and DeBlois recalled Ving Rhames\\'s performance in Pulp Fiction (1994) and cast him.[9]\\n During the film\\'s early development, Ricardo Montalbán was cast as one of the villains, with his vocal performance based on the voice he used for Khan Noonien Singh in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.[9] However, all the lines he recorded were removed and his character was cut after the meeting that lead to the removal of Stitch\\'s gang from the story. Eventually the villainous role in the film would be Gantu voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson who is best known for playing villain roles in shows and movies. David Ogden Stiers (who had previously done voices for Disney in past films) was chosen to be the voice of Jumba. Australian actress Zoe Caldwell got the role of voicing the Grand Councilwoman, the leader of the United Galactic Federation.[9]\\n In a deviation from several decades\\' worth of Disney features, Sanders and DeBlois chose to use watercolor painted backgrounds for Lilo & Stitch, as opposed to the traditional gouache technique.[8] Watercolors had been used for the early Disney animated shorts, as well as the early Disney features Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1940), and Dumbo (1941), but the technique had been largely abandoned by the mid-1940s in favor of less complicated media such as gouache. Sanders preferred that watercolors be used for Lilo & Stitch to evoke both the bright look of a storybook and the art direction of Dumbo, requiring the background artists to be trained in working with the medium.[8][21]\\n The animation itself was all based on 2D work since the budget was too small for computer-generated imagery.[20] The character designs were based on Sanders\\'s personal drawing style, rather than the traditional Disney in-house style.[8] To assist the animators with adapting Sanders\\'s style, Sue C. Nichols, the film\\'s visual development supervisor, created a manual, Surfing the Sanders Style.[13] Because of the limited budget, details like pockets or designs on clothing were avoided in the animation process, and since they could not afford to do shadows throughout much of the film, many of the scenes took place in shaded areas, saving shadows for more pivotal scenes.[20]\\n The film\\'s extraterrestrial elements, such as the spaceships, were designed to resemble marine life, such as whales and crabs.[28] One altered scene in the film involved Stitch, Nani, Jumba, and Pleakley hijacking a Boeing 747 jet from Lihue Airport that scrapes against buildings through downtown Honolulu. But after the September 11 attacks, with only a few weeks left in production, the climax was completely reworked to have them use Jumba\\'s spacecraft instead. The location was also shifted to have them fly through the mountains of Kauaʻi.[29][30] Regardless, the final design still has engines that resembled the 747\\'s jet engines, according to Sanders.[20]\\n Even after this adjustment, the team had enough budget for about two additional minutes of animation, which was used to create the epilogue montage of Lilo, Nani, and Stitch becoming a new family.[20][31]\\n On June 16, 2002, Lilo & Stitch premiered at the El Capitan Theatre. Alongside the filmmakers and Disney studio executives, Priscilla and Lisa Marie Presley, Wynonna Judd, Phil Collins, Gregory Hines, and Jodie Foster were also in attendance.[32]\\n Wanting Stitch to be a central part of the film\\'s marketing campaign, Sanders pitched a subversive idea: \"what if Stitch invaded other Disney properties?\" Dick Cook, then chairman of Walt Disney Studios, loved the idea and allowed for four parody teaser trailers to be made (nicknamed \"Inter-stitch-als\"), in which Stitch crashes memorable moments of four films from the Disney Renaissance (three of which Sanders had worked on): The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994).[25] Most of the original actors reprised their roles in the trailers, but they were shocked when asked to act negatively toward Stitch.[citation needed] The trailers also include the AC/DC song \"Back in Black.\"\\n The marketing campaign also included several tie-in promotions, like Lilo & Stitch toys being offered as part of McDonald\\'s Happy Meals.[33] In the United Kingdom, Lilo & Stitch trailers and television ads featured a cover of Elvis\\'s song \"Suspicious Minds\", performed by Gareth Gates, who became famous on the UK TV program Pop Idol. In the U.S., \"Hound Dog\" was used for both theatrical and television trailers. The marketing campaign presented Stitch as the sort of \"Disney Family Black Sheep\". As a promotional campaign, comics of Lilo & Stitch ran in Disney Adventures before the film\\'s release. The comics detailed events leading up to the film for both title characters, including Stitch\\'s creation and escape. These events were later contradicted by the sequel Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch, rendering the comics non-canonical, but the comics are notable for introducing Experiment 625, Reuben, who was a main character in the subsequent movies and TV series.[citation needed] Most of the comic series have been released as a collective volume, Comic Zone Volume 1: Lilo & Stitch.\\n Lilo & Stitch was released on VHS and DVD on December 3, 2002.[34] During the first day of release, more than 3 million DVD copies were sold, earning $45 million in retail sales.[35][36] This THX-certified DVD release features various bonus features, including a \"Build An Alien Experiment\" game, an audio commentary, music videos, deleted scenes, teaser trailers, and DVD-ROM.[37] In 2003, a 2-disc DVD version was announced to come out along with Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Pocahontas (1995), which were released in 2004 and 2005. \\n A 2-Disc Special Edition DVD of the film was released in Australia on November 10, 2004 and the UK on August 22, 2005, along with the UK release of Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch (2005), but a release in the US was affected by many delays. On March 24, 2009, Disney finally released the special edition DVD, called the \"Big Wave Edition\". This DVD edition retained the original supplemental features, along with an audio commentary, a two-hour documentary, more deleted scenes, a number of behind-the-scenes featurettes, and some games.\\n On June 11, 2013, Lilo & Stitch was released on Blu-ray and re-released on DVD alongside Lilo & Stitch 2 in a \"2-Movie Collection\", which included a single Blu-ray with both films but without bonus features, a reprint of disc one of the \"Big Wave Edition\" DVD, and a reprint of the Lilo & Stitch 2 DVD.[38] The \"2-Movie Collection\" has since seen two re-releases; one on January 31, 2017, containing only the Blu-ray and a code to redeem a digital download of the two films,[39] and another on August 9, 2022, which places both films on separate Blu-ray discs that also contain most of their original DVD bonus features, the two DVDs from the first Blu-ray collection, and a digital download code as with the second Blu-ray collection.[40]\\n A scene where Nani chases Lilo was modified for the UK home video release.[41] In the original, Lilo hid in a clothes dryer, which was changed to a commode with a cabinet and pizza box used as a \"door\" to avoid influencing children to hide in dryers.[42] The UK edit was later used for the film\\'s Disney+ release[42] and the 2022 Blu-ray release.[citation needed]\\n Lilo & Stitch opened in second place earning $35.3 million in its first weekend, ranking narrowly below Tom Cruise\\'s Minority Report.[43] During its second weekend, it fell to third place, behind Minority Report and Mr. Deeds.[44] Despite the opening of Men in Black II the week after, Lilo & Stitch remained in third place.[45]\\n Meanwhile, Lilo & Stitch continued to draw in families while other major summer blockbusters like Spider-Man and Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones were still in wide release.[46] Additionally, it went on to compete against the Warner Bros. live-action/animated hybrid film, Scooby-Doo, along with Matt Damon\\'s action film, The Bourne Identity.[46] The film earned $145.8 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $127.3 million internationally, totaling $273.1 million worldwide.[2]\\n In the UK, Lilo & Stitch collected $2.4 million during its opening weekend, ranking in first place ahead of Signs and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.[47] The film would be overtaken by Red Dragon in its second weekend.[48]\\n At the end of its theatrical run, Lilo & Stitch earned $145.8 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $127.3 million internationally, totaling $273.1 million worldwide.[2] It became the second-highest-grossing animated film of 2002, behind 20th Century Fox\\'s Ice Age. They were the only two animated films to approach the $100 million mark that year domestically.[49] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 25 million tickets during its original run.[2]\\n Lilo & Stitch received critical acclaim.[50][51] Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 149 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site\\'s critics consensus reads, \"Edgier than traditional Disney fare, Lilo and Stitch explores issues of family while providing a fun and charming story.\"[52] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[53] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[54]\\n Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3+1⁄2 stars out of 4, writing: \"It\\'s one of the most charming feature-length cartoons of recent years—funny, sassy, startling, original and with six songs by Elvis. It doesn\\'t get sickeningly sweet at the end, it has as much stuff in it for grown-ups as for kids, and it has a bright offbeat look to it.\"[55] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \"Looser and less obviously formulaic in its fresh approach to our hearts, the brash [film] has an unleashed, subversive sense of humor that\\'s less corporate and more uninhibited than any non-Pixar Disney film has been in time out of mind. With its hand-drawn characters and its use of watercolors for backgrounds (the first time the studio\\'s done that since the 1940s), this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema\\'s most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable.\"[56] Richard Corliss of Time magazine felt the film is \"a bright, engaging bauble with half a dozen Elvis Presley songs for Mom and Dad, and just enough sass. Stitch sticks his tongue into his nose and eats his snot to keep the tweeners giggling ...after a lag in the early sister scenes, Lilo reveals its own very American verve and wit, along with a smart story sense that marks the best animated features, traditional or computerized.\"[57]\\n Claudia Puig of USA Today noted the colors \"are ultra-vibrant and rich, appropriate to the Hawaiian setting. Best of all, the movie has an endearingly cheeky attitude sometimes missing from more earnest Disney tales. Witty, touching and well paced, Lilo & Stitch is ideal family fare, but little more.\"[58] Desson Howe of The Washington Post also praised the film\\'s use of watercolors, writing it is \"appealing. It\\'s easy, rather than flashy, on the eyes. And there\\'s some sort of relief in that, in this world of hyper-powerful computer-generated imagery.\"[59] Owen Gleiberman, reviewing for Entertainment Weekly, argued the \"animation in Lilo & Stitch has an engaging retro-simple vivacity, and it\\'s nice to see a movie for tots make use of Elvis Presley, but the story is witless and oddly defanged. Stitch gets discovered by Lilo, a temperamental Hawaiian girl who\\'s the whiniest of whiny brats. These two become friends in theory only: There\\'s so little connection between them that just about the only thing sustaining the movie is its vague E.T. outline.\"[60]\\n Todd McCarthy of Variety felt Sanders and DeBlois \"keep things moving briskly while commendably avoiding any special sentimental \\'We Are a Village\\' point-making, despite the obvious opportunity. Character designs are familiar enough, but backgrounds possess an unusual pastel quality that gives the film an inviting atmosphere all its own.\"[61] In contrast, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Gate felt Lilo & Stitch was more appropriate for a television series, writing the directors \"find themselves locked into the structure of a feature film. They\\'re forced to tell the story of Lilo and Stitch\\'s relationship, to give it shape and a sense of arrival. Since this is a kid\\'s movie, the relationship can only head in the direction of schmaltz. So the promising anarchy of the first 10 or 15 minutes is suppressed.\"[62]\\n Peter M. Nichols states that through the character of Nani and her struggles, the film appeals to older children better than such attempts by the studio to do so as The Emperor\\'s New Groove, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, and Treasure Planet.[63]\\n Lilo & Stitch: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack is the soundtrack to Disney\\'s 2002 animated feature Lilo & Stitch. It was released by Walt Disney Records on June 11, 2002, on Audio CD and Compact Cassette.\\n The soundtrack contains two original songs from the film written by Mark Kealiʻi Hoʻomalu and Alan Silvestri (the film\\'s composer), and performed by Kealiʻi Hoʻomalu and the Kamehameha Schools children\\'s chorus. It also contains five songs by American singer Elvis Presley, and two of his songs re-recorded by contemporary artists. These songs were performed by American singer Wynonna (\"Burning Love\") and Swedish group A-Teens (\"Can\\'t Help Falling in Love\").\\n On June 23, 2003, the soundtrack album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of 1 million units.[65] On March 17, 2023, the song \"Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride\" received Platinum certification from the RIAA for reaching 1 million certified units.[66]\\n \"Baby You Belong\" by Faith Hill was used as the theme song in the Japanese version. In North America the song was simply an album track with no connotation to the film.[67]\\n ^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\\n ‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\\n On August 26, 2003, Disney released a direct-to-video sequel, Stitch! The Movie, which served as the pilot to a television series titled Lilo & Stitch: The Series. This series ran for 65 episodes between September 20, 2003, and July 29, 2006. The series carried on where the film left off and charted Lilo and Stitch\\'s efforts to capture and rehabilitate Jumba\\'s remaining experiments. The series, as well as the original parts of the franchise that focused on Lilo Pelekai and were set in Hawaii, ended with the television film Leroy & Stitch, which aired on June 23, 2006.\\n On August 30, 2005, Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch, another direct-to-video sequel to the film, was released. In this film (set between Lilo & Stitch and Stitch! The Movie), Stitch has a glitch because his molecules were never fully charged (this is contrary to an original opening, \"Stitch\\'s trial\", which was seen on the DVD release of Lilo & Stitch). Lilo wants to win the May Day hula contest like her mother did in the 1970s, but Stitch continues to have outbursts. Lilo gets increasingly mad at Stitch as his glitch causes more problems for her and ruins her chances of winning the competition. She thinks Stitch is not cooperating properly, until she finds out that Stitch is dying. The Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch DVD also contained a short film, The Origin of Stitch, that served as a bridge between Stitch Has a Glitch and Stitch! The Movie.\\n In March 2008, Disney announced an anime based on the Lilo & Stitch franchise aimed at the Japanese market titled Stitch!. The anime, which ran as a series from October 2008 to March 2011, features a Japanese girl named Yuna Kamihara in place of Lilo, and is set on a fictional island in Okinawa Prefecture instead of Hawaii. This series was produced by Madhouse for its first two seasons, and Shin-Ei Animation for its third season and two post-series specials in 2012 and 2015.\\n From March 27 to April 6, 2017, an English-language Chinese animated television series based on the franchise titled Stitch & Ai aired in China with a Mandarin Chinese dub. It was produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media. Like with the Stitch! anime, it features a local girl named Wang Ai Ling instead of Lilo, and is set in the Huangshan mountains. Unlike Stitch!, however, this series was originally produced in English in co-operation with American animators (including those who worked on Lilo & Stitch: The Series) and then dubbed into Mandarin Chinese; the original English production aired in Southeast Asia during February 2018.\\n In October 2018, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Walt Disney Pictures was developing a live-action remake of Lilo & Stitch to be produced by Aladdin producers Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich and written by Mike Van Waes.[78] In November 2020, it was reported that Jon M. Chu entered talks to direct the film and that it was unclear if the film would be released in theaters or on Disney+. In July 2022, Dean Fleischer Camp replaced Chu as the film\\'s director.[79] In February 2023, Zach Galifianakis joined the film.[80][81] On March 31, 2023, it was announced that Maia Kealoha was cast as Lilo.[82] Further cast members were announced that April, including Sydney Agudong as Nani,[4] Courtney B. Vance as Bubbles,[83] and Billy Magnussen in an undisclosed role.[84] Kahiau Machado was originally cast as David, but was later replaced by Kaipo Dudoit.[85] On April 21, 2023, Galifianakis was confirmed to play Jumba, and Magnussen was confirmed to play Pleakley, while Chris Sanders entered in final negotiations to return as the voice of Stitch.[86] Tia Carrere, the original voice actress of Nani, was announced to play Mrs. Kekoa, while Amy Hill, who voiced Mrs. Hasagawa in the original, will portray a new character named Tūtū.[87]\\n In August 2024, the film was shifted to a summer 2025 theatrical release.[88] Two months later, the film was given a release date of May 23, 2025 in the United States.[89]\\n There were three official games released in 2002 to coincide with the film: Disney\\'s Lilo & Stitch: Trouble in Paradise for PlayStation and Microsoft Windows, Disney\\'s Lilo & Stitch for Game Boy Advance, and Disney\\'s Stitch: Experiment 626 for PlayStation 2. Stitch is also a summonable character in Kingdom Hearts II and III, and appears along with his homeworld in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep for the PlayStation Portable. Lilo and Stitch both appear in the Nintendo 3DS game Disney Magical World and its sequel. Stitch is also a playable character in the Disney Infinity series in the second game, Disney Infinity 2.0, and the series\\' third and final game, Disney Infinity 3.0. He was also a meet and greet character in Kinect: Disneyland Adventures. Some characters of the film are playable characters in the game Disney Magic Kingdoms. Stitch also appears as a playable character in the mobile game Disney Mirrorverse, and as an unlockable villager Disney Dreamlight Valley. Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Gantu, and (from Lilo & Stitch: The Series) Angel are playable racers in Disney Speedstorm, which also features a track environment based on the film\\'s depiction of Kauaʻi.', 'Rio or Río is the Portuguese, Spanish, and Maltese word for \"river\". The term also exists in Italian, but is largely obsolete and used in a poetical or literary context to mean \"stream\"; the standard Italian word for \"river\" is fiume.\\n Rio, RIO or Río may also refer to:', 'Brave(s) or The Brave(s) may refer to:', 'Horton Hears a Who! is a children\\'s book written and illustrated by Theodor Seuss Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss. It was published in 1954 by Random House.[2] This book tells the story of Horton the Elephant and his adventures saving Whoville, a tiny planet located on a speck of dust, from the animals who mock him. These animals attempt to steal and burn the speck of dust, so Horton goes to great lengths to save Whoville from being incinerated. \\n \"A person\\'s a person, no matter how small\" is the most popular line from Horton Hears a Who! and also serves as the major moral theme that Dr. Seuss conveys to his audience.[3] Horton endures harassment to care for and ensure the safety of the Whos, who represent the insignificant. Horton Hears a Who! has been well-received in libraries, schools, and homes across the world. The book has been adapted as a 1970 television special and a 2008 animated film by Blue Sky Studios and 20th Century Fox Animation, and much of its plot was incorporated into the Broadway musical production Seussical.[4]\\n Geisel began work on Horton Hears a Who! in the fall of 1953. It is his second book to feature Horton the Elephant with the first being Horton Hatches the Egg. The Whos would later reappear in How the Grinch Stole Christmas!. The book\\'s main theme, \"a person\\'s a person no matter how small\", was Geisel\\'s reaction to his visit to Japan, where the importance of the individual was an exciting new concept.[5] Geisel, who had harbored strong anti-Japan sentiments before and during World War II, changed his views dramatically after the war and used this book as an allegory for the American post-war occupation of the country.[6] His comparison of the Whos and the Japanese was a way for him to express his willingness for companionship. Geisel strived to relay the message that the Japanese should be valued equally, especially in a stressful post-war era.[7] He dedicated the book to a Japanese friend.[8]\\n The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant, who, \"On the 15th of May, in The Jungle of Nool\", while splashing in a pool, hears a speck of dust talking to him. Horton surmises that a small person lives on the speck and places it on the top of a red clover, vowing to protect it. He later discovers that the speck is actually a tiny planet, home to a community called Whoville, where microscopic creatures called Whos live. The Mayor of Whoville asks Horton to protect them from harm, which Horton happily agrees to, proclaiming throughout the book, \"A person\\'s a person, no matter how small\".\\n Throughout the book, Horton is trying to convince the Jungle of Nool that \"a person is a person no matter how small\" and that everyone should be treated equally. In his mission to protect the speck, Horton is ridiculed and harassed by the other animals in the jungle for it since they believe that anything that can\\'t be seen or heard is nonexistent. He is first criticized by the sour kangaroo and her joey. The splash they make as they jump into the pool almost reaches the speck, so Horton decides to find somewhere safer for it. But the news of his odd new behavior spreads quickly, and he is soon harassed by the Wickersham Brothers, a group of monkeys (which are actually apes). They steal the clover from him and give it to Vlad Vladikoff, a “black-bottomed” eagle. Vlad flies the clover a long distance, with Horton in pursuit, until Vlad drops it into the middle of a field of clovers that stretches for hundreds of miles.\\n After an extremely long search, Horton finally finds the clover (the 3,000,000th flower) with the speck on it. However, the Mayor informs him that Whoville, the town on the speck, is in bad shape from the fall, and Horton discovers that the sour kangaroo and the Wickersham Brothers (along with their extended family) have caught up to him. They tie Horton up and threaten to boil the speck in a hot steaming kettle of \"Beezle-Nut\" oil. To save Whoville, Horton implores the little people to make as much noise as they can, to prove their existence. So almost everyone in Whoville shouts, sings, and plays instruments, but still no one but Horton can hear them. So the Mayor searches Whoville until he finds a very small shirker named JoJo, who is playing with a yo-yo instead of making noise. The Mayor carries him to the top of Eiffelberg Tower, where JoJo shouts out a loud \"Yopp!\", which finally makes the kangaroo and the monkeys hear the Whos. Now convinced of the Whos\\' existence, the other jungle animals vow to help Horton protect the tiny community.\\n Horton Hears a Who! was published on August 28, 1954, by Random House Children\\'s Books which is a division of the publishing company Random House.[2] There are four formats of the book that exist including a hardcopy version, a paperback version, an e-book version, and an audio version. There are several editions of the hardcopy version including a \"Party Edition\" and a 65th-anniversary edition. Dr. Seuss has sold hundreds of millions of copies in over thirty languages of his well-known children\\'s books, which includes Horton Hears a Who![9]\\n Horton Hears a Who! is written in anapestic tetrameter, like many other Dr. Seuss books.[10] Unlike some of his books, however, Horton contains a strong moral message—\"a person\\'s a person, no matter how small\"—which Thomas Fensch identifies as \"universal, multinational, multi-ethnic. In a word: Equality\".[11]\\n The book unites two polar opposite worlds through Horton\\'s determination, integrity, faithfulness, and bravery.[12]\\n Horton Hears a Who! received praise for the moral message Dr. Seuss exemplifies through Horton the Elephant. A 2002 news article in the Santa Fe Reporter details comedic performer Susan Jayne Weiss saying, \"Horton is the ultimate metaphor for believing in yourself, your mission and what you know to be true, against societal prescriptions to the contrary\".[13] Ben Witherington of the Asbury Theological Seminary applauds Dr. Seuss for his work in the characterization of Horton as the elephant fights to show the other animals that even the small people are people deserving of respect and love. Additionally, Witherington commended Dr. Seuss for his disdain for cynicism while proving that the imagination can solve life\\'s troubles.[14]\\n Peter Tonguette, writing for National Review, lauded the book\\'s intricate and thoughtful rhymes and appealing illustrations defined Seuss\\'s work.[15]\\n In recent years, the book has been co-opted by the United States anti-abortion movement, with some interpreting \"a person\\'s a person, no matter how small\" as being an allegory for the human fetus. This interpretation has been criticized by Audrey Geisel, the widow of the author, and Karl ZoBell, an attorney for Dr. Seuss Enterprises.[16]\\n Horton Hears a Who! was adapted into a half-hour animated TV special by MGM Animation/Visual Arts in 1970. It was directed by Chuck Jones, produced by Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), and narrated by Hans Conried, who also voiced Horton. The Sour Kangaroo (voiced by June Foray)\\'s name is Jane Kangaroo while her son is named Junior. Horton\\'s contact in Whoville was not the Mayor, but a scientist named Dr. Hoovie who was also voiced by Hans Conried. Vlad Vladikov\\'s name was changed to Whizzer McWoff. Dr. Seuss was awarded a Peabody Award for the animated special Horton Hears a Who! [17]\\n The story, along with Horton Hatches the Egg, also provides the basic plot for the 2000 Broadway musical Seussical with \"the biggest blame fool in the jungle of Nool\", Horton the Elephant, as the main protagonist. Seussical debuted on November 30, 2000, at the famed Richard Rodgers Theatre with high expectations. The music in the play was written by Tony Award winners Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty.[4] The show flopped and eventually closed six months later on May 20, 2001.[18] Known as one of \"Broadway\\'s biggest losers\", Seussical lost an estimated 11 million dollars.[18] During its time on Broadway, Seussical\\'s Kevin Chamberlin was nominated for one Tony Award (Best Actor in a Musical).[18]\\n Horton Hears a Who! was adapted into a computer-animated feature-length film of the same name in 2008, using computer animation from Blue Sky Studios, the animation arm of 20th Century Fox. The cast includes Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, Carol Burnett, Will Arnett, and Amy Poehler. It was released on March 14, 2008.[9] The film received 18 award nominations including a Kids\\' Choice Award, Golden Schmoes Award, and Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films.[citation needed] The film also won the\\xa0American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Award at the ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards show.[19]\\n An animated series based on the book Horton Hears a Who! aimed at preschoolers, among other Seuss story adaptations, is in development for Netflix.[20]', 'The Smurfs (French: Les Schtroumpfs; Dutch: De Smurfen) is a Belgian comic franchise centered on a fictional colony of small, blue, humanoid creatures who live in mushroom-shaped houses in the forest. The Smurfs was created and introduced as a series of comic characters by the Belgian comics artist Peyo (the pen name of Pierre Culliford) in 1958, wherein they were known as Les Schtroumpfs.\\n There are more than 100 Smurf characters, and their names are based on adjectives that emphasise their characteristics, such as \"Jokey Smurf\", who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow Smurfs. \"Smurfette\" was the first female Smurf to be introduced in the series. The Smurfs wear Phrygian caps, which came to represent freedom during the modern era.\\n The word \"smurf\" is the original Dutch translation of the French \"schtroumpf\", which, according to Peyo, is a word he invented during a meal with fellow cartoonist André Franquin when he could not remember the word salt.[1][2][3]\\n The Smurfs franchise began as a comic and expanded into advertising, films, TV series, ice capades, video games, theme parks, and toys. By 2008, the franchise had generated $4 billion in revenue, making The Smurfs one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.[4]\\n At the time he came up with the idea for the Smurfs, Peyo was the creator, artist, and writer of the Franco-Belgian comics series titled Johan et Pirlouit (translated to English as Johan and Peewit), set in Europe during the Middle Ages and including elements of sword-and-sorcery. Johan serves as a brave young page to the king, and Peewit (called  Pirlouit (pronounced Peer-loo-ee) in the original French version) functions as his faithful, if boastful and cheating, midget sidekick. In 1958, Spirou magazine started the prepublication of the new Johan et Pirlouit comic book La Flûte à six trous (\"The Flute with Six Holes\").[5] The adventure involved their recovery of a magic flute, which required some sorcery by the wizard Homnibus. In this manner, they met a tiny, blue-skinned humanoid in white clothing called a \"Schtroumpf\", followed by his numerous peers who looked just like him, with an elderly leader who wore red clothing and had a white beard. Their first full appearance was published in Spirou on October 23, 1958.[6] The characters proved to be a huge success, and the first independent Smurf stories appeared in Spirou in 1959, together with the first merchandising. The Smurfs shared more adventures with Johan and Pirlouit, got their own series and all subsequent publications of the original story were retitled La Flûte à six Schtroumpfs (also the title of the movie version of the story).\\n With the commercial success of the Smurfs came the merchandising empire of Smurf miniatures, models, games, and toys. Entire collecting clubs have devoted themselves to collecting PVC Smurfs and Smurf merchandise.\\n Schtroumpf (IPA [ʃtʁumf] ⓘ) is pronounced like the German word \"Strumpf\" meaning \"sock\". However, according to Peyo, the original author of the Smurfs comic strip, the term and the accompanying language of the Smurfs came during a meal he had with his colleague and friend André Franquin at the Belgian coast. Having momentarily forgotten the word \"salt\", Peyo asked him (in French) to pass the schtroumpf. Franquin jokingly replied, \"Here\\'s the Schtroumpf—when you are done schtroumpfing, schtroumpf it back...\" and the two spent the rest of that weekend speaking in \"schtroumpf language\".[1][3]\\n Both the comics and cartoons have been translated in many languages. In most cases, the original name \"Schtroumpf\" is replaced by a new term. The most common are variations of the Dutch translation \"Smurf\", which is also used as the name in English. However, other names are indicative of their gnome-like appearance.\\n In English, they were briefly named the goblins in the book Dilly Duckling and the Goblins (1973) before being renamed the Smurfs.[7]\\n In Spanish, they are called Pitufos, a term invented by  Miguel Agustí who was the head of the Spanish magazine Strong, which first published the cartoon in Spanish. According to Agustí, he was walking around Barcelona while trying to come up a name for the cartoon. He came across a sculpture of the Ox of Patufet and was inspired by the word Patufet. From the Catalan Patufet he derived the non-existent word Pitufo. (Catalans themselves use the term Barrufet, formerly used to mean goblin or gnome, to avoid confusion with their own Patufet.) The name later spread to most Spanish-language versions of the cartoon.[8]\\n In Hebrew, the name chosen was \"Dardasim\" (דרדסים), originally an old-fashioned  Hebrew term for a slipper which due to the series\\' success in Israel has now gone completely out of use in its original sense.\\n Worldwide, there are about 55 translations of the word Schtroumpf, including[9]\\n The storylines tend to be simple tales of bold adventure. The cast has a simple structure as well: almost all the characters look essentially alike—mostly male (a few female Smurfs have appeared: Smurfette, Sassette, and Nanny Smurf), short (\"three apples high\"),[10] with blue skin, white trousers with a hole for their short tails, white hat in the style of a Phrygian cap, and sometimes some additional accessory that identifies a personality (for example, \"Handy Smurf\" wears overalls instead of the standard trousers, a brimmed hat, and a pencil above his ear). Smurfs can walk and run, but often move by skipping on both feet. They love to eat sarsaparilla (a species of Smilax) leaves, whose berries the Smurfs naturally call \"smurfberries\". The smurfberries appear only in the cartoon; in the original comics, the Smurfs only eat the leaves from the sarsaparilla.\\nThe Smurfs fulfill simple archetypes of everyday people: \"Lazy Smurf\", \"Grouchy Smurf\", \"Brainy Smurf\", and so on. All Smurfs, with the exception of Papa, Baby, Smurfette, Nanny and Grandpa, are said to be 100 years old. There were originally 99 Smurfs, but this number increased as new Smurf characters appeared, such as Sassette and Nanny. All of the original Smurfs were male; later female additions are Smurfette and Sassette. Smurfette was Gargamel\\'s creation, while Sassette was created by the Smurflings.[11]\\n A characteristic of the Smurf language is the frequent use of the undefinable word \"smurf\" and its derivatives in a variety of meanings. The Smurfs frequently replace both nouns and verbs in everyday speech with the word \"smurf\": \"We\\'re going smurfing on the River Smurf today\". When used as a verb, \"to smurf\" typically means \"to make\", \"to be\", \"to like\", or \"to do\".\\n Humans have found that replacing ordinary words with the term \"smurf\" at random is not enough: in one adventure, Peewit explains to some other humans that the statement \"I\\'m smurfing to the smurf\" means \"I\\'m going to the wood\", but a Smurf corrects him by saying that the proper statement would be \"I\\'m smurfing to the smurf\"; whereas what Peewit said was \"I\\'m warbling to the dawn\". So \"I\\'m smurfing to the smurf\" is not the same as \"I\\'m smurfing to the smurf\".[12]\\n In the animated series, only some words (or a portion of the word) are replaced with the word \"smurf\". Context offers a reliable understanding of this speech pattern, but common vocabulary includes remarking that something is \"just smurfy\" or in some cases, \"smurftastic\".\\n In Schtroumpf vert et vert Schtroumpf (see Smurf Versus Smurf), published in Belgium in 1972, it was revealed that the smurf village was divided between North and South, and that the Smurfs on either side had different ideas as to how the term \"smurf\" should be used: for instance, the Northern Smurfs called a certain object a \"bottle smurfer\", while the Southern Smurfs called it a \"smurf opener\". This story is considered a parody on the still ongoing taalstrijd (language war) between French- and Dutch-speaking communities in Belgium.[13]\\n When they first appeared in 1958, the Smurfs lived in a part of the world called \"Le Pays Maudit\" (French for \"the Cursed Land\"). To reach it required magic or travelling through dense forests, deep marshes, a scorching desert and a high mountain range.[14] The Smurfs themselves use storks in order to travel long distances, such as to the kingdom where Johan and Pirlouit live, and keep up-to-date with events in the outside world.[15]\\n In the Johan et Pirlouit stories, the Smurf village is made up of mushroom-like houses of different shapes and sizes in a desolate and rocky land with just a few trees. However, in the Smurf series itself, the mushroom-like houses are more similar to one another and are located in a clearing in the middle of a deep forest with grass, a river, and vegetation. Humans such as Gargamel are shown to live nearby, though it is almost impossible for an outsider to find the Smurf village except when led by a Smurf.[16]\\n Papa Smurf is the leader of the community. Other Smurfs are generally named in reference to their main personality trait; for example, Brainy, Greedy, Vanity, Lazy, Clumsy, Hefty, Jokey, Dreamy, Grouchy; or their profession; for example, Poet, Actor, Handy, Harmony, Farmer, Clockwork, Painter, Tailor, Miner, Architect, Reporter, Timber, Barber and Doctor Smurf; much like Disney\\'s Seven Dwarfs. The first female Smurf, Smurfette, was created by Gargamel to lure the other Smurfs. Papa Smurf then changed her into what we see today. The non-Smurf characters who would appear later would include their enemies: the wizard Gargamel, his cat Azrael, an ugly witch Hogatha, and Gargamel\\'s godfather Balthazar; and their friends: the page Johan and his young friend Peewit, and the wizard Homnibus. There are more than 100 Smurfs.[17]\\n Since the first appearance of the Smurfs in Johan et Pirlouit in 1958, more than 40 Smurf comics volumes have been created, 16 of them by Peyo, the others by his studio. Originally, the Smurf stories appeared in Spirou magazine with reprints in many different magazines, but after Peyo left the publisher Dupuis, many comics were first published in dedicated Smurf magazines, which existed in French, Dutch, German and Turkish. A number of short stories and one page gags have been collected into comic books next to the regular series. English translations have been published in the U.S. by the graphic novel publisher Papercutz as well as a mini series published by Marvel Comics in the mid-1980s.\\n Peyo\\'s drawing style is similar to his fellow cartoonists from the Marcinelle school.[18] The emphasis is on movement, enhanced by the use of Indian ink, with comic aspects regularly appearing.[19] This style was approached by his successors, although there are also differences.[20]\\n In 1965, a black-and-white 87-minute animated film called Les Aventures des Schtroumpfs was released in theatres in Belgium. It consisted of five short cartoons made in the previous years for broadcasting on Walloon TV. German copies and copies with Dutch subtitles are known to exist. The stories were based on existing Smurf stories like The Black Smurfs and The Smurfs and the Egg, and were created by writer Maurice Rosy and artist Eddy Ryssack from the small Dupuis animation studios.[21] In total, ten animated shorts were created between 1961 and 1967, the first series in black and white and the later ones in colour.\\n In 1976, La Flûte à six schtroumpfs (an adaptation of the original \"Johan et Pirlouit\" story) was released. Michel Legrand provided the musical score to the film. The film would be released in the United States in 1983 (after the animated series became popular there) in an English language dubbed version titled The Smurfs and the Magic Flute. A few more full-length Smurf films were made, most notably The Baby Smurf and Here are the Smurfs. created from episodes of the Hanna-Barbera television cartoon series.\\n Sony Pictures announced plans to begin a trilogy of live-action/animated Smurf films, with the first film released on July 29, 2011;[22] the project had been in various stages of development since 2003.[23] In June 2008, it was announced that Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation had acquired film rights from Lafig Belgium. Jordan Kerner produced the film, with the screenwriters including Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third screenwriters J. David Stem and David N. Weiss.[24][25] The film stars Jonathan Winters as Papa Smurf, Katy Perry as Smurfette, George Lopez as Grouchy Smurf, Gary Basaraba as Hefty Smurf, John Oliver as Vanity Smurf, Alan Cumming as Gutsy Smurf, Paul Reubens as Jokey Smurf, Hank Azaria as Gargamel, Neil Patrick Harris as Patrick Winslow and Jayma Mays as Grace Winslow, a couple in New York who help the Smurfs get back to their village. It was suggested that Quentin Tarantino would play Brainy Smurf, but this \"didn\\'t work out\" so Fred Armisen voices Brainy instead.[26] A CGI/traditionally animated mini-film, titled The Smurfs: A Christmas Carol, was released on December 2, 2011, on The Smurfs DVD and Blu-ray.[27] A sequel to The Smurfs, titled The Smurfs 2, was released on July 31, 2013.[28]  A fully animated Smurfs reboot film, Smurfs: The Lost Village, was released on April 7, 2017, with Demi Lovato starring as Smurfette.[29]\\n At CinemaCon on August 25, 2021, it was announced that a new Smurfs movie is in the works. The movie will be a musical and it is planned for a December 20, 2024 release for Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon.[6] In August 2022, Paramount Pictures announced that the movie was pushed back to February 14, 2025, with Sonic the Hedgehog 3 taking its previous release date.[30]\\n The Smurfs secured their place in North American pop culture in 1981, when the Saturday morning cartoon series The Smurfs, produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions in association with SEPP International S.à.r.l., aired on NBC from September 12, 1981, to December 2, 1989 (reruns until August 25, 1990). The show continued to air on the USA network until 1993, and on Cartoon Network until 2003. The Smurfs is still broadcast on the Boomerang channel throughout the United States. The show became a major success for NBC, spawning spin-off television specials on an almost yearly basis. The Smurfs was nominated multiple times for Daytime Emmy awards, and won Outstanding Children\\'s Entertainment Series in 1982–1983.[23] The Smurfs television show enjoyed continued success until 1990, when, after nearly a decade of success, NBC cancelled it due to decreasing ratings and plans to extend their Today morning show franchise to create a Saturday edition, although they did not do so until 1992, two years later. The decreased ratings were the result of the network changing the format of the show, resulting in the final season featuring regular time travel with only a few Smurfs.\\n In the TV series, many classical masterpieces are used as background music during the episodes, among them Franz Schubert\\'s Unfinished Symphony (Symphony No. 8 in B minor), Edvard Grieg\\'s Peer Gynt and Modest Mussorgsky\\'s Pictures at an Exhibition.[31]\\n The Smurfs was named the 97th best animated series by IGN. It has been called \"kiddie cocaine\" for people growing up during the 1980s.[32]\\n On August 31, 2017, it was announced that IMPS and Dupuis Audiovisuel would be working on the new Smurfs TV series with CGI animation. The series was scheduled for 2020 but postponed to 2021. It is co produced by Ketnet (Flanders), TF1 (France), KiKa (Germany),[33] OUFTIVI (Wallonia), Peyo Productions, and Dupuis Audiovisuel[34][35][36] (the TV branch of the comics publisher). It shows new stories, not adaptations of comics or other older stories.[37] Nickelodeon picked up the series for a 2021 release in the United States.[38]\\n On February 26, 2008, Warner Home Video released Season 1 Volume 1 on DVD, containing the first 19 episodes. On October 7, 2008, Warner Bros. released Season 1 Volume 2 on DVD, containing the remaining 20 episodes from season 1. Though Warner Bros. has decided to discontinue the season sets and release single-disc volume sets instead, they are reportedly still following the correct order of episodes.[citation needed]\\n Magna Home Entertainment in Australia has released a 9-disc 50th Anniversary Collection, containing a total of 52 episodes.[citation needed] In September 2009, a Smurfette-themed collection containing 25 episodes was made available followed by the \"Papa Smurf Collection\" in December 2009 containing 26 themed episodes.[39]\\nIn July 2010, both the Smurfette and Papa Smurf Collection were included in a special \\'Favourites Collection\\'.[40] Also releasing at the same time was the Smurfs\\' first feature film (produced in 1975), The Smurfs and the Magic Flute, available for the first time on DVD, in Australia.[41]\\n On November 3, 2010, two \"Just Smurfy\" collections were released, each featuring episodes not yet released on DVD to the Australian market.[42][43] December 3, 2010 saw the 3rd collection hit the market.[44] A fourth Just Smurfy set was planned for release on March 2, 2011.[45]\\n Magna Home Entertainment in Australia have released Season 1[46] and Season 2[47] on August 24, 2011.

An \"Ultimate Collection 2\",[51] which features Season 6 to Season 9, was released on November 2, 2011.\\n The show was released on DVD in the UK through a joint conjunction with Arrow Films and Fabulous Films Ltd. The complete 1st season was released in a four-disc box set on July 5, 2010. Season 2 was released on September 6, 2010, Seasons 3, 4 and 5 were released on July 1, 2013, and the original Smurfs feature film, The Smurfs and The Magic Flute, was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 11, 2010.\\n Papa Smurf, Hefty Smurf, and Brainy Smurf appeared in the cartoon crossover Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue along with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck (from the Looney Tunes franchise), Huey, Dewey, and Louie (from DuckTales), Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Garfield, Alvin and the Chipmunks, the Muppet Babies (Kermit, Piggy and Gonzo respectively), Slimer (from The Real Ghostbusters), ALF, and Michelangelo (from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). Smurfette appeared on the promotional poster, but never[clarification needed] appeared in the actual film.\\n From 1959 until the end of the 1960s, Dupuis produced Smurf figurines. But the best known and most widely available Smurf figurines are those made by Schleich, a German toy company. Most of the Smurf figurines given away as promotional material (e.g. by National Garages in the 1970s and McDonald\\'s in the 1990s) are also made by Schleich. New Smurf figures continue to appear; in fact, only in two years since 1969 (1991 and 1998) have no new Smurfs entered the market. Schleich currently produces 8 to 12 new figurines a year. Over 300 million of them have been sold so far.[23]\\n Other Smurf figurines have been created for advertising purposes, e.g. worldwide for McDonald\\'s and Kinder Surprise, or nationally for e.g. Albert Heijn in the Netherlands, and Delhaize in Belgium. Special Smurf comics were often created for advertising campaigns. This started in the 1960s for Kwatta and Kellogg\\'s, and later for companies like BP in the UK and Australia, or Benco (a Dutch chocolate drink).[52] These comics were often only part of a larger campaign, e.g. the Benco comics were accompanied by a TV ad.[53]\\n A Smurf balloon/float/Falloon (which is half float, half balloon) continues to be presented in holiday parades such as Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade.[54]\\n Smurfs had two cereals in the 1980s made by Post Cereals: Smurf-Berry Crunch cereal and Smurfs Magic Berries. Both had animated commercials on Saturday morning. Two Smurfs pastas, made by Chef Boyardee and DelVerde, were made in the 1980s as well. Also Libby\\'s and Heinz came out with Smurf-A-Getti canned pasta for the American and Canadian market.\\n The Smurfs had a commercial in the 1980s for the Mexican snack cake company Marinela Submarinos with a rare version of Smurfette (Pitufina) dressed in a red dress and her hair done in pigtails.\\n Over the decades, many singles and albums of Smurf music have been released in different countries and languages, sometimes very successfully, with millions of copies sold. The best known is the single The Smurf Song and its accompanying album, created by Dutch musician Pierre Kartner who sang under the alias Father Abraham, which reached the #1 position in 16 countries. Worldwide, more than 10 million CDs with Smurf music have been sold between 2005 and 2007 alone.[23]\\n In 1989, I.M.P.S and R-Tek Music, International created Smurfin!: Tenth Anniversary Commemorative Album, released by Quality Special Products in Canada and the United States and Dino Music in Australia. It was also released in parts of Europe. The Album came out on LP, CD and cassette. The LP featured 20 tracks (The Canadian CD and cassette had 16, the American CD had 10). The songs were covers of popular songs like \"Surfin\\' U.S.A.\", \"Kokomo\", \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\", and \"I Think We\\'re Alone Now\", as well as two original songs.\\n For several years, the Smurfs were the children\\'s act in the Ice Capades travelling ice show. After they were retired from that function, the Smurf suits from the show were issued to Ice Capades Chalets, the show\\'s subsidiary chain of ice rinks, lasting until the show was sold to a group of investors led by Dorothy Hamill. The Chalets were sold to Recreation World. The Smurfette suit in particular had a somewhat different hairstyle from what was portrayed in the Hanna-Barbera cartoons.\\n In 1984, the Smurfs began appearing in North American theme parks owned by Kings Entertainment Corporation. Each park featured a Smurf attraction and Smurf walk-around figures. Canada\\'s Wonderland had an entire Smurf village to walk through, ending with Gargamel\\'s Castle. \"The Smurfs\\' Enchanted Voyage\" was located in Kings Island. Kings Dominion has \"Smurf Mountain\". California\\'s Great America featured a pint-sized steel coaster, \"The Blue Streak\". Carowinds had an artificial island that was named Smurf Island that had a Smurf village—including toadstool houses which could be entered. Hanna–Barbera Land had a Smurf district.\\n In 1989, in the French region of Lorraine, the Sorépark group opened a complete Smurfpark, named Big Bang Schtroumpf. In 1991, the park was bought by the successful Belgian Walibi Group and renamed Walibi Schtroumpf with new attractions. After the Walibi Group was acquired by Six Flags, the park was named Walibi Lorraine, and all the Smurfs references in the park were removed in 2003.\\n Comics Station, Ankara Amusement Park, Motiongate Dubai, Movie Animation Park Studios, and Dream Island feature Smurf sections.\\n The Smurfs have appeared in video games made for most major game consoles (including Nintendo\\'s NES, Super NES, and Game Boy systems, Atari 2600, ColecoVision, Sega\\'s Game Gear, Master System, Mega Drive and Mega CD systems, and the original Sony PlayStation) and for the PC. In 2010, the Smurfs expanded into the world of apps for Android, the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch with the game Smurf Village.\\n In 2005, an advertisement featuring The Smurfs was aired in Belgium in which the Smurf village is annihilated by warplanes.[61] Designed as a UNICEF advertisement, and with the approval of the family of the Smurfs\\' late creator Peyo, the 25-second episode was shown on the national television after the 9 p.m. timeslot to avoid children having to see it. It was the keystone in a fund-raising campaign by UNICEF\\'s Belgian arm to raise money for the rehabilitation of former child soldiers in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo—both former Belgian colonies.\\n In honour of their 50th anniversary in 2008, the Smurfs began a year-long \"Happy Smurfday Euro Tour\" in connection with UNICEF. The Smurfs visited fifteen European countries on the day of their 50th \"Smurfday\" in the form of publicly distributed white figurines. The recipients could decorate and submit them to a competition. The results of this contest were auctioned off and raised a total amount of 124,700 euros for benefit of UNICEF.[62]\\n The 50th anniversary of the Smurfs and the 80th anniversary of the birth of its creator Peyo, were celebrated by issuing a high-value collectors\\' coin: the Belgian 5 euro 50th anniversary of The Smurfs commemorative coin, minted in 2008.\\n In 1998, writer Marc Schmidt wrote a parody article citing the Smurfs as an example of the impact of socialism in continental European culture.[63][64] In 2011, Schmidt\\'s essay was scrutinised in a response essay by Kate Krake, who examined the nature of cultural theory built on textual observation and warned against creating false allegories out of texts like The Smurfs.[65]\\n French sociologist Antoine Buéno described Smurf society in a 2011 book as a totalitarian and racist utopia with antisemitic tones.[66][67][68] Studio Peyo head Thierry Culliford, the son of Peyo, dismissed Buéno\\'s accusations as \"grotesque and frivolous\".[69]', 'Zootopia (titled Zootropolis or Zoomania in various regions)[b] is a 2016 American animated buddy cop action comedy film[6][7] produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, co-directed by Jared Bush, and produced by Clark Spencer, from a screenplay written by Bush and Phil Johnston, and a story by Howard, Moore, Bush, Johnston, Jim Reardon, Josie Trinidad, and Jennifer Lee. The film stars the voices of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Tommy Chong, J. K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Shakira. The film follows a rookie police officer rabbit and a con artist fox as they work together to uncover a conspiracy involving the disappearance of predators. \\n Zootopia premiered at the Brussels Animation Film Festival in Belgium on February 13, 2016,[8] and went into general theatrical release in Disney Digital 3-D, RealD 3D, IMAX 3D, and 4DX formats in the United States on March 4.[9][10] Zootopia received positive reviews from critics, who praised its screenplay, animation, voice acting, subject matter, and Michael Giacchino\\'s musical score.[11][12][13] The film opened to record-breaking box offices in several countries, and earned a worldwide gross of over $1\\xa0billion, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2016. Among other accolades, the film was named one of the top ten best films of 2016 by the American Film Institute and won Best Animated Feature at the 89th Academy Awards.[14] A television spin-off series, Zootopia+, premiered on Disney+ on November 9, 2022, while a sequel, Zootopia 2, is scheduled for release on November 26, 2025.\\n In a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, Judy Hopps, a rabbit from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her childhood dream of becoming the first rabbit police officer in the city of Zootopia. On her first day at the Zootopia Police Department (ZPD), she is given parking duty by Chief Bogo,  and is hustled by two con artist foxes, Nick Wilde and Finnick, during her shift. The next day, she abandons her post to arrest small-time crook Duke Weaselton for stealing a bag of crocus bulbs. Later, while Chief Bogo is reprimanding Judy, Mrs. Otterton visits his office, pleading for her husband Emmitt, one of 14 missing predators, to be found. Without first seeking approval, Judy volunteers, and Bogo attempts to fire her for insubordination, but the city\\'s assistant mayor, Dawn Bellwether, praises Judy for taking the assignment. Bogo begrudgingly agrees, but demands Judy\\'s resignation if she cannot close the case within 48 hours.\\n Having ascertained that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy blackmails Nick into helping her by covertly recording his confession to tax evasion. They track a limousine that picked up Emmitt and find his belongings inside. They learn that the limousine is owned by Mr. Big, an arctic shrew crime boss whom Nick has a history with. Mr. Big reveals that Emmitt unexpectedly \"went savage\" and mindlessly attacked the limousine\\'s chauffeur, Manchas, a black jaguar. Judy and Nick question Manchas, who explains that Emmitt yelled about \"Night Howlers\" before attacking him. Manchas suddenly turns savage himself and chases Judy and Nick. Judy traps Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but Manchas vanishes before backup arrives. Bogo demands Judy\\'s resignation, but Nick reminds him that Judy still has 10 hours to solve the case. After leaving the scene with Judy, Nick reveals that as a child, he was bullied by his peers because they had prejudiced beliefs about foxes.\\n At City Hall, Bellwether allows Judy and Nick to access Zootopia\\'s traffic cameras, which reveal Manchas was abducted by timberwolves, whom Judy assumes are the Night Howlers. Following the wolves, Judy and Nick locate Emmitt, Manchas and the other missing predators, who are all \"savage\" and imprisoned in an asylum. Zootopia\\'s mayor, Leodore Lionheart, had ordered their capture, and is trying to secretly ascertain what caused their feral behavior. Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.\\n Judy, praised for solving the case, asks Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. At a press conference, Judy accidentally implies the savageness epidemic was caused by the physiology that all predators possess. Disappointed and offended by the remarks, Nick abandons Judy, whose comments subsequently incite fear and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia. Wracked with guilt, she quits her job and returns to Bunnyburrow.\\n While managing her parents\\' vegetable stand, Judy learns that Night Howlers are actually Midnicampum flowers, which have severe, lasting psychotropic effects if ingested. Realizing that someone is deliberately using the flowers to turn predators savage, she returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Nick. Aided by Mr. Big, they interrogate Weaselton, who admits that a ram named Doug hired him to steal the Night Howler bulbs. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in Zootopia\\'s subway, where he manufactures a serum from the Night Howlers to use against predators via a dart pistol. Judy and Nick obtain a serum gun as evidence after a dangerous chase in the subway, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum and reveals herself to be the mastermind of a prey-supremacist conspiracy. Judy and Nick become trapped in an exhibit, and Bellwether shoots Nick with the serum gun, then orders the ZPD to capture him, but Judy and Nick reveal that they had replaced the darts with blueberries and recorded Bellwether\\'s confession.\\n Bellwether and her accomplices are arrested for their crimes, while the still-imprisoned Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of her scheme, insisting that imprisoning the infected predators was \"doing the wrong thing for the right reason\". The predators are rehabilitated  and Judy is reinstated into the ZPD. Months later, Nick graduates from the police academy, becoming Judy\\'s partner and the first fox police officer.\\n Development of the film that would come to be called Zootopia began when Byron Howard pitched six story ideas to Disney Animation chief creative officer and executive producer John Lasseter, of which three involved animal characters: an all-animal adaptation of The Three Musketeers,[41] a 1960s-themed story about a \"mad doctor cat...who turned children into animals\", and a \"bounty hunter pug in space\".[42] The common thread running through these ideas was that Howard wanted to do a film similar to Disney\\'s Robin Hood, which also featured animals in anthropomorphic roles.[43] According to Howard, Zootopia emerged from his desire to create something different from other animal anthropomorphic films, where animals either live in the natural world or in the human world. His concept, in which animals live in a modern world designed by animals for animals, was well received by Lasseter, who responded by embracing and lifting Howard \"in the air like a baby Simba\".[44] Lasseter suggested that Howard should try combining the 1960s theme with the animal characters, especially the space pug.[42] This led Howard to develop and pitch Savage Seas, an international spy film centered on an arctic hare named \"Jack Savage\" who was somewhat like James Bond.[42][45] It was around this time that screenwriter Jared Bush was hired to work on the film; he was excited to work on a spy film because his own father and grandfather had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.[42]\\n Howard and Bush continued to develop the film with the assistance of the Disney Story Trust, the studio\\'s top creative personnel who meet regularly to review and discuss all projects in development.[45] The most delightful part of the spy film turned out to be its first act, set in a city created by and for animals.[42] To focus on the all-animal city, Howard eventually dropped the 1960s setting, along with the espionage and international aspects, and changed the film into a contemporary police procedural in which Nick Wilde was the lead role and Judy Hopps was essentially his sidekick.[42][45][46] For a while, \"the filmmakers were very committed\" to that version of the story,[45] but then in November 2014, the filmmakers realized the film\\'s plot would be more engaging if they reversed the roles to instead focus on Hopps as opposed to Wilde.[46] The change in perspective involved dropping several characters, including two characters known as \"The Gerbil Jerks\" who were described as \"trust-fund gerbils that had nothing better to do than harass Nick.\"[47]\\n In May 2013, The Hollywood Reporter initially reported that Howard was directing the film and that Jason Bateman had been cast, but little else about the film was known at the time.[16] Zootopia was first officially announced on August 10, 2013, at the D23 Expo, with a March 2016 release date.[43][49]\\n Research for the film took place in Disney\\'s Animal Kingdom, as well as in Kenya and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, where animators spent eight months studying various animals\\' walk cycles as well as fur color.[50][51] Eight hundred thousand forms of mammals were created for and featured in the film.[51] To make the characters\\' fur even more realistic, they also went to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County to closely observe the appearance of fur with a microscope under a variety of lighting.[52][51] The filmmakers drew inspiration for Zootopia\\'s urban design from major cities including New York City, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Brasília.[53] To develop a city that could actually be inhabited by talking mammals ranging in size from two inches (5.1\\xa0cm) to 27 feet (8.2\\xa0m) and from drastically different climates, the filmmakers consulted Americans with Disabilities Act specialists and HVAC system designers.[54] For assistance with designing motor vehicles appropriate for so many different types and sizes of mammals, the filmmakers consulted with J Mays, former chief creative officer of the Ford Motor Company.[55] During the development process, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn suggested that Nick should expressly state his disappointment (\"Just when I thought someone actually believed in me...\") after discovering that Judy still fears him as a predator.[56] In March 2015, it was revealed that Rich Moore (Wreck-It Ralph) had been added as a director of the film, in addition to Jared Bush (Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero) as co-director.[57]\\n Disney\\'s most recent work on animating fur was for the titular character of the 2008 film Bolt, but the software they had used at the time was not ready for creating the realistic fur of the animals of Zootopia. Therefore, the studio\\'s IT engineers developed the fur-controlling software \"iGroom\", which gave character designers precise control over the brushing, shaping, and shading of fur and made it possible to create a variety of eccentric character styles for each animal. The software was also able to control an unseen \"imaginary\" under-layer that gave fur a degree of plushness not seen before. This feature was used to create characters like Officer Clawhauser, who has a big head that is entirely made of spotted fur. Characters with noteworthy numbers of strands of hair or fur included both of the two lead characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, who each had around 2.5 million hairs; a giraffe with nine million strands of fur; a gerbil with 480,000 strands; and a rodent with more strands of hair than the 400,000 that were on Elsa\\'s head in Frozen.[51]\\n Zootopia was the second time Disney used the Hyperion renderer, which they had first used on Big Hero 6. A new fur paradigm was added to the renderer to facilitate the creation of realistic images of the animals\\' dense fur. Nitro, a real-time display application developed since the making of Wreck-It Ralph, was used to make the fur more consistent, intact, and subtle much more quickly, as opposed to the previous practice of having to predict how the fur would work while making and looking at silhouettes or poses for the character. The tree-and-plant generator Bonsai, first used in Frozen, was used to make numerous variations of trees with very detailed foliage.[51]\\n Zootopia was produced in makeshift quarters in a giant warehouse in North Hollywood (together with Moana) while Disney Animation\\'s headquarters in Burbank was being renovated.[58]\\n On May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were announced as having been cast, respectively, in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps.[15] The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring \"a funny yet heartfelt side\" with \"a wily, dry-witted sort of voice\". Bateman described his character as \"a crafty, sarcastic schemer\", remarking on the role\\'s similarity to many other roles he had done since he was 12. He explained that he had said to the directors: \"\\'What kind of voice do you guys want me to do?\\' And they just looked at me like I was an idiot and said, \\'Just do what you do. Just talk.\\'\"[59]\\n Commenting on the casting of Goodwin, Moore said that she brought \"very centered sweetness, tremendous heart and a great sense of humor\"; he described Judy as \"a little Pollyanna mixed with Furiosa\". Goodwin stated about her character: \"People mistake kindness for naïveté or stupidity, and she is a good girl through and through. But she\\'s not a dumb bunny.\"[59]\\n The film\\'s score is composed by Michael Giacchino, in his first feature-length project for Walt Disney Animation Studios,[60] as he previously worked on several short films and television specials produced by the company, as well as multiple Pixar films. Recording took place from November 16–20, 2015, with an 80-piece orchestra conducted by Tim Simonec.[61] In addition to her voice role of Gazelle, pop star Shakira also contributed an original song to the film titled \"Try Everything\", which was written by Sia and Stargate.[20][62] The soundtrack was released on March 4, 2016, by Walt Disney Records.[63][64]\\n The first teaser trailer was released online at Walt Disney Animation Studios\\' YouTube page on June 11, 2015.[65] A second teaser trailer was released online again at Walt Disney Animation Studios\\' YouTube page on November 23, 2015, featuring a sequence of the film where the main characters encounter a Department of Mammal Vehicles (based on the DMV) run entirely by sloths.[66] The official theatrical trailer for the film was released online at Walt Disney Animation Studios\\' YouTube page on New Year\\'s Eve 2015.[67] Figures of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde were released for Disney Infinity 3.0 on March 1, 2016.[68]\\n In addition, the studio devoted considerable marketing attention to the furry fandom demographic, believing that they would logically be most interested in this film project.[69]\\n Zootopia was released on March 4, 2016, in Disney Digital 3-D, RealD 3D, and IMAX 3D, making it the first Disney animated film shown in domestic IMAX theatres since Treasure Planet (2002).[9][10] It was shown for the first time to the public as a feature film in an international competition for a young audience during the Brussels Animation Film Festival in Belgium on February 7, and was screened to the general media and audience on February 13.[70][71]\\n In China, the state\\'s SAPPRFT granted the film a rare two-week extension to play in theaters in addition to its limited 30-day run, which was to have ended on April 3.[72]\\n The film was retitled for theatrical release across several international territories. In the United Kingdom and other European, Middle Eastern, and North African countries, the film was renamed Zootropolis, a reference to the concept of a \"metropolis\" rather than to that of a \"utopia\".[73][74][75] This was due to Disney being unable to trademark the name \"Zootopia\" in these territories for various legal reasons, including Danish Givskud Zoo registering the name Zootopia in 2014.[76] In Germany, the film was titled Zoomania due to a children\\'s book by German author Kay Fischer titled Zootropolis released in 2010.[77][78]\\n Zootopia was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD, and Digital HD platforms on June 7, 2016.[citation needed] It includes some bonus material such as \"Scoretopia\", an alternate opening, and the music video to Shakira\\'s \"Try Everything\".[79] The film debuted at the top of the home media sales chart for the week ending on June 12, 2016.[80] The film made a revenue of $89.6 million from home media sales with 4.4 million units sold, making it the third best-selling title of 2016 behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Finding Dory.[81] Zootopia was released on 4K Blu-ray on November 5, 2019.[82]\\n On June 22, 2020, amid the reopening of theaters due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Disney announced that Zootopia, along with 11 other Disney owned titles, were to return to US theaters during a 4-week period. Zootopia returned to US theaters on June 26 and played through July 2, 2020, alongside The Avengers, and The Greatest Showman.[83] The re-release grossed a total of $393,600.[84]\\n On July 20, 2020, it was announced that the film would be returning to theaters in China, along with Big Hero 6 and the Chinese debut of Sonic the Hedgehog on July 31, 2020.[85]\\n As part of Disney\\'s 100th anniversary, Zootopia was re-released in Helios theaters across Poland on October 22, 2023.[86]\\n Zootopia grossed $341.3 million in the U.S. and Canada and $682.5 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $1.024 billion, against a budget of $150 million.[4][5] On March 18, 2016, the film reached the $500 million mark, becoming the third consecutive Walt Disney Animation Studios film to reach the milestone after Frozen (2013) and Big Hero 6 (2014).[87][88] On April 5, it became the first film of 2016 to gross over $800 million in ticket sales,[89] and on April 24, became the first film of 2016 to cross $900 million.[90] On June 5, the film crossed the $1 billion mark, becoming the second film of 2016 to do so (after the studio\\'s own Captain America: Civil War), the fourth animated film (after Toy Story 3, Frozen and Minions), the eleventh Disney film, the third Disney animated film, and the twenty-sixth film overall to reach the milestone.[91]\\n Worldwide, it was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2016 (behind Civil War, Rogue One, and Finding Dory),[92] the second-highest-grossing animated film of 2016,[92] the second-highest-grossing Walt Disney Animation Studios film (second-highest overall) of all time in its original release (after Frozen),[89] the second-highest-grossing original film (behind Avatar),[93] and the fourth-highest-grossing animated film of all time. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $294.9 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the fifth-most profitable release of 2016.[94]\\n In the United States and Canada, pre-release tracking suggested the film would open to $60–70 million from 3,827 theaters in its opening weekend.[95][96] It played in 3,100 3D theaters, 365 IMAX theaters, and 325 premium large format screens.[95] It earned $1.7 million from Thursday previews, a record for a non-Pixar Disney animated film,[97] for an animated film opening outside of summer,[98] and seventh-biggest all time for an animated film.[99] Buoyed by good word of mouth, it earned $19.5 million on its opening day, also a record for a non-Pixar Disney animated film (breaking Frozen\\'s record),[97] and the second-biggest for a March animated film (behind Ice Age: The Meltdown).[100] In its opening weekend, it scored a better than expected $75.1 million, which was the biggest non-Pixar Disney animated opening (breaking Big Hero 6\\'s record), the biggest opening weekend among Walt Disney Animation Studios films (breaking Frozen\\'s record), the biggest March animated opening (breaking The Lorax\\'s record), the seventh-biggest March opening, and the tenth-biggest animated opening of all time.[101][102][103] Furthermore, its opening weekend is also the fourth-biggest for an original film, behind The Secret Life of Pets, Inside Out, and Avatar.[104][105] It also performed exceptionally well in IMAX, where the film brought in $5.2 million from 366 screens, the second-best animated IMAX opening behind only Toy Story 3 ($8.4 million).[102]\\n In its second weekend, it fell gradually by 31% to $51.3 million and recorded one of the best holds for an animated film, more or less on par with Wreck-It Ralph\\'s second weekend drop of 32%, but a bigger drop than The Lego Movie\\'s 27%.[106] It continued to top the box office for the third weekend, earning $37.2 million, falling by 28% from its previous weekend while passing the $200 million mark.[107] This made it the second-biggest third weekend for a film that did not open at over $100 million, behind Avatar ($68 million) and ahead of Skyfall ($35 million).[108] The film was overtaken by the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice in its fourth weekend, despite only a marginal decline.[109] It spent a total of 13 consecutive weeks in the top ten, more than any other film except for Avatar (14 weeks) and Frozen (16 weeks) over the last decade.[93]\\n It ended its theatrical run on August 4, 2016, after playing in theaters for a total of 154 days.[5] It became the second-highest-grossing Walt Disney Animation Studios film (behind Frozen),[110] the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2016,[111] and the tenth-highest-grossing animated film of all time.[112] In June 2020, due the worldwide closure of cinemas during the COVID-19 pandemic and limits on which films played, Zootopia returned to 280 theaters—mostly drive-ins—and grossed $393,600.[113]\\n Zootopia received a scattered release as Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures took advantage of school holidays in various markets. The film opened in a limited number of international markets in the weekend ending February 14, earning $4.5 million in three markets.[114] It expanded to 22 markets in its second weekend, into 36% of its total international markets, and added $31.2 million.[115] It added another $33 million in its third weekend with no new markets.[116] In its fourth weekend, it expanded to 45 countries and grossed $64.7 million, coming in second place at the international box office, behind the Chinese film Ip Man 3.[117] $3.3 million came from IMAX showings.[117] It finally topped the box office in its fifth weekend after a strong second-weekend gross in China. It added $89.3 million from 45 countries, an increase of 25% from its previous weekend.[118] It remained in first place for the second time in its sixth weekend,[119] before Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice took the top spot.[120] It passed the $500 million mark in its eighth weekend.[121]\\n In its opening weekend—which varied between markets—the film grossed $3.1 million in Spain and an additional $1.7 million in Belgium and Denmark. In Belgium, it had the biggest ever animated opening for a Disney or Pixar film.[114] It broke opening records for a non-Pixar Disney animated film in China ($23.6 million), France ($8.1 million), Russia ($7.8 million), Germany ($6.6 million), Hong Kong ($1.5 million), Poland ($1.2 million), and India.[115][117][120][122] It opened in the United Kingdom and Ireland with $7.5 million, Mexico with $4.6 million, Australia with $3.2 million, Brazil with $2.6 million, and in Italy, on a non-holiday weekend with $3.1 million.[115][119][120] The film had number-one openings in Austria, Switzerland, Portugal, and South Africa.[117] In the UK and Ireland, with significant competition from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and the animated family film Kung Fu Panda 3, the film had a £5.31 million ($7.6 million) opening weekend from 579 theaters, including £1.74 million ($2.5 million) worth of previews, debuting in second place behind Dawn of Justice and falling just short of Walt Disney Animation Studios\\' best opening in the UK.[123][124] It fell just 24% in its second weekend.[125]\\n Zootopia\\'s largest markets overseas are China ($235.6 million), followed by Japan ($70.1 million), Russia and the CIS ($39.2 million), Germany ($34.2 million), the UK ($34.2 million), France ($31.9 million), and South Korea ($31.6 million).[126][127][128] In China, it is the highest-grossing Disney film in local currency (¥1.530 billion), surpassing Avengers: Age of Ultron (¥1.464 billion), as well as the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time.[129][130] In Russia, it is the second-highest-grossing film of all time in local currency (₽2.3 billion), behind only Avatar (₽3.6 billion).[131] It topped the Russian and German box office for three weekends,[132][133] and the Chinese and Korean box office for two weekends.[134][135]\\n In China, where it was locally known as Crazy Animal City (疯狂动物城),[75] the film exceeded expectations[136] and was considered Hollywood\\'s biggest breakout success in China since 2015\\'s Jurassic World made $229 million.[137] It had an opening day of $3.4 million on its way to $23.6 million for its three-day opening weekend, debuting in second place and scoring the biggest non-sequel animated opening, as well as the second-biggest three-day opening and IMAX opening for an animated film, behind Kung Fu Panda 3.[117] In its ninth day of release (a Saturday), it recorded the biggest single-day gross ever for an animated film, with $25 million (compared to $10.6 million on its first Saturday), and passed the lifetime total of Big Hero 6 to become the highest-grossing Disney animated film in China.[138][139] In its second weekend, it grossed $60 million,[140] an enormous increase of 139% from its previous weekend, and crossed the $100 million mark to become the third animated film in China to do so, after Kung Fu Panda 3 and Monkey King: Hero Is Back. This also marked the single best weekend for an animated film.[118] In mid-March, the combined total of Kung Fu Panda 3 and Zootopia alone broke 2014\\'s record of $286 million in box office grosses for American animated features in China.[141] In its third weekend, it grossed $40 million for a total of $175 million, making it the highest-grossing animated film of all time in China.[142] On March 27, its seventeenth day of release, it passed the $200 million mark, becoming the first animated film, the second Disney film, and the sixth Hollywood film overall to pass that milestone.[120] It became the highest-grossing animated film of all time and the second-highest-grossing film of 2016, behind only The Mermaid.[143]\\n It opened in Japan on April 23[144] and earned $4 million in its opening weekend, debuting at second place in the box office, behind Detective Conan: The Darkest Nightmare,[145][146] and had the third-biggest Walt Disney Animation Studios debut in that market, behind Frozen and Big Hero 6.[90] Deadline.com pointed out that the average opening number might have been due to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes, which could have affected moviegoers.[90] In a rare achievement, it topped the box office in its third weekend after two weeks at No. 2.[147] In the following two weekends, it continued to increase its ticket sales,[148] and topped the box office there for four consecutive weekends.[149][150] After four straight wins, it was finally overtaken by the R-rated superhero film Deadpool.[151] It was the No. 1 western/Hollywood film for eight consecutive weekends.[152] The Hollywood Reporter cited that strong word of mouth, audiences watching both the English and Japanese versions, and 3D and 4DX screenings, as well as a popular Japanese version of the \"Try Everything\" song by Dream Ami, all helped boost Zootopia\\'s performance.[149] Its strong run in the market aided the film to propel past the $1 billion mark worldwide.[153] It remained in top three for 11 consecutive weekends and has grossed a total of $70.1 million there.[154][155][156]\\n On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 298 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads: \"The brilliantly well-rounded Zootopia offers a thoughtful, inclusive message that\\'s as rich and timely as its sumptuously state-of-the-art animation—all while remaining fast and funny enough to keep younger viewers entertained.\"[11] It was the site\\'s second-highest-rated film of 2016 behind Moonlight.[157] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 78 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[158] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[159][97]\\n Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times considered the movie \"funny, smart, [and] thought-provoking\".[160] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Zootopia \"may be the most subversive movie of\" 2016, giving the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praising its timely message about the harm of prejudice in the face of the prevailing xenophobic political rhetoric at the time of the film\\'s release, and the film\\'s humor.[12] Peter Debruge at Variety opined that Zootopia \"plays directly to the studio\\'s strength\".[161] IGN reviewer Eric Goldman gave the film a 9.0 out of 10 \\'Amazing\\' score, saying \"Zootopia is a wonderful example of how Disney, at its best, can mix its past and present together in a very cool, compelling way. It takes the classic animation trope of animals walking, talking, and acting like humans, but gives it a modern spin both in terms of its humor and animation style ... and also in its themes, which are meaningful and fascinatingly topical.\"[162]\\n \\nWriting in British Sunday newspaper The Observer, reviewer Mark Kermode:  Very funny, and very likable holiday treat... The ensuing drama is nominally a tale of predators succumbing to their animal instincts while frightened prey fear their neighbours. In fact, it\\'s a delightfully well-orchestrated parable about trust and tolerance versus panic and prejudice. An encouragingly upbeat celebration of love and diversity in times of hate and uncertainty. If that all sounds overly on-message, then fear not—the jokes are funny, the characters engaging, and the animation packed with delicious visual detail... this is proper family fun with genuine cross-generational appeal. Hooray![163] In the UK daily newspaper The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin noted, \"The lion doesn\\'t just lie down with the lamb, they run for City Hall on a joint ticket. It\\'s the diversity dream come true. Or is it? […] Think Busytown by way of Chinatown. It\\'s almost certain to be the most existentially probing talking animal cartoon of the year.\" Collin added, \"Like Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in 48 Hrs., albeit considerably cuter, Judy and Nick make a hilariously strained but effective double act – not least thanks to Goodwin and Bateman\\'s tremendous vocal work, which trips along with the effortless swing and snap of great bebop.\"[164]\\n Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com, despite generally liking the film (three out of four stars), had trouble with the film\\'s central metaphor that conflicted with its message:  Zootopia is constantly asking its characters to look past species stereotypes, and not use species-ist language or repeat hurtful assumptions. This all seems clever and noble until you realize that all the stereotypes about various animals are to some extent true, in particular the most basic one carnivores eat herbivores because it\\'s in their nature. If Zootopia were a bit vaguer, or perhaps dumber and less pleased with itself, it might have been a classic, albeit of a very different, less reputable sort. As-is, it\\'s a goodhearted, handsomely executed film that doesn\\'t add up in the way it wants to.[165] Also in The Daily Telegraph, Rosa Prince singled out the film\\'s lead character, Judy Hopps, as a welcome change for Disney animated feature film heroines, such as the Disney Princess franchise. She found that unlike those characters\\' focus on romance or family loyalty, Hopps\\' focus is on her dream career as a police officer and serving her city.[166]\\n Some were critically divided of the message about universal prejudices of all sorts interpreted as an allegory of American racism. Nico Lang of Consequence of Sound felt that Disney delivered a kids\\' version of Crash.[167] Others criticized the use of prey and predator species in the \"allegory\"[168][169][170] while critics at The Root stated positively that the movie acknowledges culpability of systemic racism and white supremacy.[171] The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction states that the film \"uses its premise to examine cultural biases, stereotypes and prejudices, including conveying a strong anti-racist message. It avoids the species A = race Y trap; though the viewer needs to accept that, in this context, animal behaviour is being treated as a stereotype.\"[172]\\n The film was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of the top ten films of 2016,[173] and won the Academy Award,[174] Golden Globe, Critics Choice Movie Award and Annie Award for Best Animated Feature Film. It also received a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film, which it lost to Kubo and the Two Strings.[175][176]\\n On March 21, 2017, a copyright infringement lawsuit was filed against Disney by Esplanade Productions, a company owned by Gary L. Goldman, the co-screenwriter of Total Recall. The lawsuit claims that Goldman (in 2000 and 2009) pitched a concept to Disney for a live-action film titled Looney, which was about a socially awkward animator who creates a self-inspired TV cartoon called Zootopia. Disney twice rejected the pitch, but Goldman accused the company of copying the name, themes, settings, and character tropes. Filed with the lawsuit was a graphic of early concept artwork of characters that are claimed to appear similar to major characters from the film, including Nick Wilde, Judy Hopps, Flash, and Chief Bogo. A Disney spokesperson described the lawsuit as being \"ridden with patently false allegations\".[177] After months of back-and-forth deliberation between the two parties, U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald dismissed the infringement claims on November 8, 2017. As stated in the final review, \"Goldman\\'s effort to make the plots of Looney and Zootopia seem similar were strained. All the purported similarities between the two works were themes, not plot points or sequences of events, that were too general to be protected by copyright law.\"[178][179] Esplanade appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the dismissal on April 24, 2019.[180]\\n A card game based on the film called Zootopia: Suspect Search was released,[181] as well as a game for mobile phones titled Zootopia Crime Files.[182]\\n In May 2018, it was announced that a Zootopia graphic novel was set to be published by Dark Horse Comics. The graphic novel, titled Disney Zootopia: Friends to the Rescue, was written by Jimmy Gownley, with art by Leandro Ricardo da Silva. It was released on September 25, 2018.[183]\\n On January 22, 2019, Disney Parks announced a themed area based on Zootopia was to be coming to Shanghai Disneyland Park, with construction on the land beginning on December 9, 2019.[184] Construction halted for a brief period during the COVID-19 pandemic, but by June 2020, construction had resumed.[185] The land opened to the public on December 20, 2023, which is part of The Walt Disney Company\\'s 100th anniversary celebration.[186] The land includes an trackless dark ride Zootopia: Hot Pursuit.\\n On September 9, 2023, it was announced at Destination D23 that the It\\'s Tough to Be a Bug! attraction at Disney\\'s Animal Kingdom of Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida would be replaced by a Zootopia show in the Tree of Life theater.[187] The show was revealed to be titled Zootopia: Better Together! in 2024, at the Disney Experiences showcase at D23, with a premiere of late 2025.[188]\\n On December 10, 2020 during the Disney Investors Day livestream, Walt Disney Animation Studios announced that a television series entitled Zootopia+ would premiere in 2022 on Disney+ as one of the studios\\' first television projects, as most TV shows based on Disney\\'s animated films are produced by Disney Television Animation. It was announced to be an anthology series that would feature storylines that follow 3 sets of characters from the film (the mobster shrews, the tiger dancers, and the sloths).[189][190][191] On November 12, 2021, Disney confirmed the series for a release in 2022, and also released a first-look teaser image which included characters from the film not previously confirmed to be in the series. The series would be directed by Trent Correy and Josie Trinidad.[192] It was released on November 9, 2022 with six shorts.[193]\\n Among the episodes include an action parody starring Bonnie and Stu Hopps, a musical starring Duke Weaselton, a Real Housewives spoof with Fru-Fru, a film noir parody with Mr. Big, a dance competition parody with Clawhauser, Bogo, and Gazelle, and a romantic comedy parody with Flash and Priscilla. Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde cameo in the action parody and make other appearances throughout.[194] All the cast members from the movie reprised their roles. The music is composed by Curtis Strong and Mick Giacchino (Michael\\'s son), with Michael scoring the \"Duke the Musical\" episode with lyrics by Kate Anderson and Elyssa Samsel (Olaf\\'s Frozen Adventure, Central Park).[195]\\n In June 2016, Howard and Moore were in talks about the possibility of a Zootopia sequel.[c] On February 8, 2023, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that a sequel to Zootopia was in the works during the Disney 2023 Q1 investors call.[201] Later that day, screenwriter and co-director Jared Bush confirmed that he is working on the film as director and writer, while Josie Trinidad, who had served as head of story for the first film alongside Jim Reardon, was confirmed as the sequel\\'s co-director, making it her feature directorial debut.[202][203] Ginnifer Goodwin, who voices Judy, told CinemaBlend that she would like to see a role reversal between Judy and Nick in the sequel. “I would like to see Nick have to be the one to convince Judy that the world is worth fighting for,” she said. Jason Bateman, who voices Nick, also told CinemaBlend about his idea for the sequel. “The two of us [Nick and Judy] kicking ass out there. Cleaning up the streets. We’re a couple of new cops out there. So, bad guys, be warned,” he said.[204] On February 7, 2024, Iger revealed during the Disney 2024 Q1 investors call that the sequel will officially be called Zootopia 2, and will release on November 26, 2025.[205] On August 9, 2024, Ke Huy Quan was announced to be playing Gary and Bush will be the sole writer and director of the film instead with Yvett Merino set to produce.[206]', 'A troll is a being in Nordic folklore, including Norse mythology. In Old Norse sources, beings described as trolls dwell in isolated areas of rocks, mountains, or caves, live together in small family units, and are rarely helpful to human beings.\\n In later Scandinavian folklore, trolls became beings in their own right, where they live far from human habitation, are not Christianized, and are considered dangerous to human beings. Depending on the source, their appearance varies greatly; trolls may be ugly and slow-witted, or look and behave exactly like human beings, with no particularly grotesque characteristic about them.\\n Trolls are sometimes associated with particular landmarks in Scandinavian folklore, which at times may be explained as formed from a troll exposed to sunlight. Trolls are depicted in a variety of media in modern popular culture.\\n The Old Norse nouns troll and trǫll (variously meaning \"fiend, demon, werewolf, jötunn\") and Middle High German troll, trolle \"fiend\" (according to philologist Vladimir Orel likely borrowed from Old Norse), possibly developed from Proto-Germanic neuter noun *trullan, meaning \"to tread, step on\". The origin of the Proto-Germanic word is unknown.[1] Additionally, the Old Norse verb trylla \\'to enchant, to turn into a troll\\' and the Middle High German verb trüllen \"to flutter\" both developed from the Proto-Germanic verb *trulljanan, a derivative of *trullan.[1]\\n In Norse mythology, troll, like thurs, is a term applied to jötnar and is mentioned throughout the Old Norse corpus. In Old Norse sources, trolls are said to dwell in isolated mountains, rocks, and caves, sometimes live together (usually as father-and-daughter or mother-and-son), and are rarely described as helpful or friendly.[2] The Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál describes an encounter between an unnamed troll woman and the 9th-century skald Bragi Boddason. According to the section, Bragi was driving through \"a certain forest\" late one evening when a troll woman aggressively asked him who he was, in the process describing herself:\\n Old Norse:\\n Anthony Faulkes translation:\\n John Lindow translation:\\n Bragi responds in turn, describing himself and his abilities as a skillful skald, before the scenario ends.[4]\\n There is much confusion and overlap in the use of Old Norse terms jötunn, troll, þurs, and risi, which describe various beings. Lotte Motz theorized that these were originally four distinct classes of beings: lords of nature (jötunn), mythical magicians (troll), hostile monsters (þurs), and heroic and courtly beings (risi), the last class being the youngest addition. On the other hand, Ármann Jakobson is critical of Motz\\'s interpretation and calls this theory \"unsupported by any convincing evidence\".[5] Ármann highlights that the term is used to denote various beings, such as a jötunn or mountain-dweller, a witch, an abnormally strong or large or ugly person, an evil spirit, a ghost, a blámaðr, a magical boar, a heathen demi-god, a demon, a brunnmigi, or a berserker.[6][7]\\n Later in Scandinavian folklore, trolls become defined as a particular type of being.[8] Numerous tales are recorded about trolls in which they are frequently described as being extremely old, very strong, but slow and dim-witted, and are at times described as man-eaters and as turning to stone upon contact with sunlight.[9] However, trolls are also attested as looking much the same as human beings, without any particularly hideous appearance about them, but living far away from human habitation and generally having \"some form of social organization\"—unlike the rå and näck, who are attested as \"solitary beings\". According to John Lindow, what sets them apart is that they are not Christian, and those who encounter them do not know them. Therefore, trolls were in the end dangerous, regardless of how well they might get along with Christian society, and trolls display a habit of bergtagning (\\'kidnapping\\'; literally \"mountain-taking\") and overrunning a farm or estate.[10]\\n Lindow states that the etymology of the word \"troll\" remains uncertain, though he defines trolls in later Swedish folklore as \"nature beings\" and as \"all-purpose otherworldly being[s], equivalent, for example, to fairies in Anglo-Celtic traditions\". They \"therefore appear in various migratory legends where collective nature-beings are called for\". Lindow notes that trolls are sometimes swapped out for cats and \"little people\" in the folklore record.[10]\\n A Scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away trolls and jötnar appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales, and may be a late reflection of the god Thor\\'s role in fighting such beings. In connection, the lack of trolls and jötnar in modern Scandinavia is sometimes explained as a result of the \"accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes\".[11] Additionally, the absence of trolls in regions of Scandinavia is described in folklore as being a \"consequence of the constant din of the church-bells\". This ringing caused the trolls to leave for other lands, although not without some resistance; numerous traditions relate how trolls destroyed a church under construction or hurled boulders and stones at completed churches. Large local stones are sometimes described as the product of a troll\\'s toss.[12] Additionally, into the 20th century, the origins of particular Scandinavian landmarks, such as particular stones, are ascribed to trolls who may, for example, have turned to stone upon exposure to sunlight.[9]\\n Lindow compares the trolls of the Swedish folk tradition to Grendel, the supernatural mead hall invader in the Old English poem Beowulf, and notes that \"just as the poem Beowulf emphasizes not the harrying of Grendel but the cleansing of the hall of Beowulf, so the modern tales stress the moment when the trolls are driven off.\"[10]\\n Smaller trolls are attested as living in burial mounds and in mountains in Scandinavian folk tradition.[13] In Denmark, these creatures are recorded as troldfolk (\"troll-folk\"), bjergtrolde (\"mountain-trolls\"), or bjergfolk (\"mountain-folk\") and in Norway also as trollfolk[14] (\"troll-folk\") and tusser.[13] Trolls may be described as small, human-like beings or as tall as men depending on the region of origin of the story.[15]\\n In Norwegian tradition, similar tales may be told about the larger trolls and the Huldrefolk (\"hidden-folk\"), yet a distinction is made between the two. The use of the word trow in Orkney and Shetland, to mean beings which are very like the Huldrefolk in Norway, may suggest a common origin for the terms. The word troll may have been used by pagan Norse settlers in Orkney and Shetland as a collective term for supernatural beings who should be respected and avoided rather than worshipped. Troll could later have become specialized as a description of the larger, more menacing Jötunn-kind whereas Huldrefolk may have developed as the term for smaller trolls.[16]\\n John Arnott MacCulloch posited a connection between the Old Norse vættir and trolls, suggesting that both concepts may derive from spirits of the dead.[17]\\n Troll, a Norwegian research station in Antarctica, is so named because of the rugged mountains which stand around that place like trolls. It includes a ground station which tracks satellites in polar orbit.\\n Trolls have appeared in many works of modern fiction, most often, in the fantasy genre, with classic examples being the portrayal of trolls in works such as in Tolkien\\'s Middle-earth[18] or the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game.[19][20]\\n Beginning in the 1950s, Troll dolls were a popular toy based on the folklore creature. Trolls based on the dolls appeared in the Hollywood animated movie Trolls (2016) and its subsequent sequels Trolls World Tour (2020), and Trolls Band Together (2023).\\n Troll[21] is the name, and main antagonist, of a 2022 Norwegian movie released by Netflix on December 1, 2022.\\n It has been hypothesized that the troll myth might have its origin in real-life interactions between anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals.[22][23]\\n  Media related to trolls at Wikimedia Commons', 'The Lion Guard is an American animated television series developed by Ford Riley[2] and based on Disney\\'s 1994 film The Lion King. The series was first broadcast with a television film titled The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar on Disney Channel on November 22, 2015, and began airing as a TV series on January 15, 2016, on Disney Junior.[3] It is the second television series to be based on The Lion King, the first being The Lion King\\'s Timon & Pumbaa (1995–1999). The Lion Guard is a sequel and spin-off to The Lion King, and takes place during the time-gap within the 1998 direct-to-video sequel The Lion King II: Simba\\'s Pride,[4] while the third and final season takes place in parallel with the film\\'s second act, with the final two episodes serving as an epilogue.\\n The second season premiered on July 7, 2017, followed by the third on August 3, 2019,[5] with the series finale airing on November 3 the same year.\\n The show centers on Kion, the son of King Simba and Queen Nala, and the younger brother of Kiara. As second-born to the throne, Kion was gifted with a power called the \\'Roar of the Elders\\' and becomes the leader of the Lion Guard, a team that protects the Pride Lands and defends the Circle of Life. \\n Despite the tradition that the Lion Guard has always been made of lions, Kion appoints his friends Bunga the honey badger, Beshte the hippopotamus, Fuli the cheetah, and Ono the egret, and together, they set out to keep their homeland safe and protect it from animals who disrespect the Circle of Life.\\n At the start of Season 2, the Lion Guard\\'s mission becomes harder when Kion\\'s deceased granduncle Scar returns as a fiery spirit and plans to destroy the Pride Lands. Scar forms an army consisted of animals from the Outlands. This eventually leads to an all-out battle between the Pridelanders and the Outlanders.\\n By Season 3, the guard, now teenagers, successfully defeat Scar. Afterwards, they leave the Pride Lands to locate the Tree of Life in Asia to cure Kion and Ono\\'s battle injuries, Kion having received a venomous scar from Ushari the cobra and Ono losing his eyesight from the poisonous volcanic fumes while rescuing Bunga. Kion\\'s team also gets a new member, a female martial eagle named Anga who replaces Ono\\'s position as the keenest of sight after Ono temporarily loses his eyesight, while the latter gains a new position as the smartest.\\n Once reaching the Tree of Life, the Lion Guard assists in defending the haven from intruders together with the Night Pride, the group and family who protects the Tree of Life. After Kion and Ono are healed and their enemies are defeated, hyenas Jasiri and Janja (the latter having reformed during the final confrontation with Scar) come looking for them and alert them that Zira and her pride are back.\\n The Lion Guard returns to the Pride Lands, only to find out that the conflict has already been settled. Zira\\'s daughter, Vitani, has formed her own Lion Guard in their absence, causing an argument between them and Kion\\'s Lion Guard. However, after seeing Vitani\\'s confidence in becoming a leader even without the Roar, Kion allows Vitani\\'s Lion Guard to succeed his Guard as defenders of the Pride Lands. Kion and his friends return to Asia where Kion marries the Night Pride\\'s leader, Queen Rani, and is crowned king of the Tree of Life.\\n The characters returning from The Lion King and its sequels and spin-offs appear in this series:\\n The series was announced by Disney on June 9, 2014, on the run-up to the first film\\'s 20th anniversary. Disney Junior general manager Nancy Kanter stated: \"It\\'s kind of like The Lion King meets The Avengers\".[10] The series\\' announcement came after a meeting between Kanter and Disney chief executive Robert Iger. Iger suggested to Kanter that Disney Junior should consider producing content to celebrate the 20th anniversary of The Lion King in 2014. Disney had shown early footage to young test audiences, who were able to make suggestions, such as adjusting the look of the hyenas.[11] Disney Consumer Products launched a line of toys to tie into the television series, as well at book titles based on the series such as Return of the Roar, Can\\'t-Wait to be Queen, Bunga the Wise, Meet the New Guard, Fuli Finds Her Place, Join the Lion Guard!, and Kion\\'s Animal Alphabet.[12] A sneak peek of The Lion Guard was shown at the 2015 D23 Expo.[13] On August 12, 2015, a sneak peek was shown, with new information that the television movie was scheduled to air in November 2015 to be titled The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar.[14] On October 9, 2015, it was announced that Return of the Roar would premiere on November 22, 2015, on Disney Channel.[15]\\n On coming up with the idea, the series\\' creator and executive producer Ford Riley noted that at the end of The Lion King the presentation of Simba and Nala\\'s newborn cub is seen. In The Lion King II: Simba\\'s Pride, it is revealed that the cub in question is Kiara and that she will be the future queen. Riley was interested in the idea of a second-born cub and what his role would be if Kiara is destined to become queen. Additionally, he was inspired by his 8-year-old son, who would visit the park with friends and pretend to be a superhero team.[4][16]\\n Riley confirmed the timeline of the series; in Simba\\'s Pride there is a years-long time gap, The Lion Guard takes place during the years in-between Kiara\\'s first meeting with Kovu as a cub and her first hunt as an adult.[4] Riley also noted the inclusion of Swahili into the series, which is used for names of characters, locations, songs, and catchphrases.[4]\\n Classic mythology is used as inspiration for the show. Riley stated \"We want it to feel epic and so we\\'re trying to draw from as many epics in classical literature and classical television in addition to (The Lion King) itself\". Riley noted that protecting the Circle of Life is the main theme of the series; \"The animals who respect it don\\'t eat too much, allow for the grass to grow, and larger animals to eat smaller animals. Our bad guys come from those that don\\'t respect the Circle of Life. They just want to eat and wreak havoc.\"[16]\\n In terms of giving The Lion Guard the same look as the original film, director Howy Parkins stated that they were mindful to keep the essence of The Lion King. To that end, the crew did extensive research on the look of the backgrounds and characters and were able to obtain some original model sheets. In addition, Barry Atkinson and Mike Surrey, background painter and supervising animator for Timon on the original film respectively, were brought in to consult with the series\\' background artists, animators and storyboard artists.[17]\\n Speaking on the show\\'s educational aspect, Parkins stated that research was done on animals and habitats in the Serengeti, and that this information is woven into storylines without being overt.[17]\\n Like its American counterpart, Return of the Roar premiered on November 22, 2015, on Disney Channel in Canada, while the series premiered on January 17, 2016, on Disney Junior, two days after its American premiere.[18][19] In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Return of the Roar premiered on Disney Junior on February 8, 2016, while the series premiered on April 13, 2016.[20][21] In Australia and New Zealand, the pilot debuted on February 6, 2016, and the series began airing on February 28, 2016, on Disney Junior.[22] In Southeast Asia, the pilot premiered on March 20, 2016, on Disney Channel (April 11 on Disney Junior) and the series itself on April 17 on the Disney Junior block on Disney Channel.[23][24]\\n Max Nicholson from IGN gave the pilot episode score of 7.7, describing the special as \"a fun-filled, if younger-skewing, hour television\". He praised the pilot for introducing more of the Lion King lore, and also the animation, music, and performance of the new voice actors. However, he found Janja and his clan lacked the appeal to make a compelling villain.[25]\\n Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph scored the pilot two stars out of five, labeling it a \"Soggy, Sentimental throwback\".[26]\\n Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the series four out of five stars, stating \"With its strong messages about courage, responsibility, and friendship, this series is a fun pick for kids, and parents who watch with their kids will enjoy seeing the original The Lion King gang -- including Timon, Pumbaa, and the eccentric Rafiki -- in cameos throughout the series\".[27]\\n Distributed by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment.\\n Talking Lion Guard Backpack Clip\\n Lion Guard Power Necklace\\n It\\'s UnBungalievable shorts\\nFive Lion Guard Wristbands\\n Distributed by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment.\\n Talking Lion Guard Backpack Clip\\n Lion Guard Power Necklace\\n It\\'s UnBungalievable shorts\\n Five Lion Guard Wristbands\\n A second soundtrack release entitled The Lion Guard: Disney Junior Music was released digitally on September 1, 2017.', 'The Legend of Korra (abbreviated as TLOK), also known as Avatar: The Legend of Korra, or more rarely simply as Korra, is an American animated fantasy action television series created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko for Nickelodeon. As a stand-alone sequel to their previous series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (The Legend of Aang),[4] which ran for three seasons from February 21, 2005, to July 19, 2008, Legend of Korra ran for 52 episodes (\"chapters\"), separated into four seasons (\"books\"), from April 14, 2012, to December 19, 2014. It has been continued as a comic book series.\\n Like its predecessor, the series is set in a fictional universe in which certain people can telekinetically manipulate, or \"bend\", one of the four elements: water, earth, fire, or air. Only one individual, the \"Avatar\", can bend all four elements, and is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. The series follows Avatar Korra, the successor and reincarnation of Aang from the previous series, as she faces political and spiritual unrest in a modernizing world.\\n The main characters are voiced by Janet Varney, Seychelle Gabriel, David Faustino, P. J. Byrne, J. K. Simmons and Mindy Sterling, and supporting voice actors include Aubrey Plaza, John Michael Higgins, Kiernan Shipka, Lisa Edelstein, Steve Blum, Eva Marie Saint, Henry Rollins, Anne Heche, and Zelda Williams. Some of the people who worked on Avatar: The Last Airbender (including designer Joaquim Dos Santos, writers Joshua Hamilton and Tim Hedrick, composer Jeremy Zuckerman and sound designer Benjamin Wynn) returned to work on The Legend of Korra.\\n The Legend of Korra has received critical acclaim, with praise for its writing and production values, and has been nominated for and won awards such as the Annie Awards, a Daytime Emmy Award, and a Gracie Award. The series was also praised for addressing sociopolitical issues such as social unrest and terrorism, as well as for going beyond the established boundaries of youth entertainment with respect to issues of race, gender, and sexual orientation. The series\\' final scene, intended to depict the beginning of a same-sex romance between Korra and Asami Sato, was unprecedented at the time and has been credited with paving the way for LGBT representation in children\\'s television.\\n The Legend of Korra was initially conceived as a twelve-episode miniseries. Nickelodeon declined the creators\\' pitch for an Avatar: The Last Airbender follow-up animated film based on what then became the three-part comics The Promise, The Search and The Rift, choosing instead to expand Korra to 26 episodes.[5] The series was expanded further in July 2012 to 52 episodes. These episodes are grouped into four separate seasons (\"Books\") composed of twelve to fourteen episodes (\"Chapters\") each, with each season telling a stand-alone story. Beginning with episode 9 of season 3, new episodes were first distributed through the Internet rather than broadcast. The Legend of Korra concluded with the fourth season.[6]\\n The Legend of Korra is set in the fictional world of Avatar: The Last Airbender, 70 years after the events of that series. The people of the world belong to four nations: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads. The distinguishing element of the series is \"bending\", the ability of some people to telekinetically manipulate the classical element associated with their nation (water, earth, fire, or air). Bending is carried out by spiritual and physical exercises, portrayed as similar to Chinese martial arts. As a result of a genocide in the series\\'s backstory, there is only one living family of airbenders at the time of the series.\\n Only one person, the \"Avatar\", can bend all four elements. Cyclically reincarnating among the world\\'s four nations, the Avatar maintains peace and balance in the world. The Legend of Korra focuses on Avatar Korra, a seventeen-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe and the successor of Avatar Aang from The Last Airbender.\\n The first season is mostly set in Republic City, the capital of the United Republic of Nations, a new multicultural sovereign state founded by Avatar Aang after the end of The Last Airbender. The 1920s-inspired metropolis is described as \"if Manhattan had happened in Asia\" by the series\\' creators,[7] and its residents are united by their passion for \"pro-bending\", a spectator sport in which two teams composed of an earthbender, waterbender, and firebender throw each other out of a ring using bending techniques. Rapid technological growth has displaced the spirituality of bending, and what was considered a renowned martial art in Avatar: The Last Airbender is now commonplace, with benders in Republic City using their abilities to commit crime, compete in spectator sports, and fulfill everyday jobs.[8] The second season adds the southern polar region, home of the Southern Water Tribe, as a main setting in addition to Republic City, while the third and fourth seasons take place largely in the Earth Kingdom.\\n The first season, Book One: Air, sees Korra move to Republic City to learn airbending from Tenzin, Avatar Aang\\'s son. She joins a pro-bending team alongside the brothers Bolin and Mako, and befriends Asami Sato, heiress to a leading engineering corporation. The ambitious politician Tarrlok enlists Korra to fight the anti-bender uprising of the \"Equalists\", led by the masked Amon, who strips benders of their abilities. Korra and her friends, aided by police chief Lin Beifong, unmask Amon as a waterbender himself and Tarrlok\\'s brother, ending the Equalists\\' coup.\\n In the second season, Book Two: Spirits, Korra\\'s uncle Unalaq, chief of the Northern Water Tribe, seizes power in the southern tribe. While Korra\\'s friends seek support against Unalaq, Korra learns of the first Avatar, Wan, who fused his soul with the spirit of light, Raava, to imprison Vaatu, the spirit of darkness. Unalaq frees Vaatu during the Harmonic Convergence, a decamillennial alignment of planets, and unites with him to become a dark Avatar. After defeating Unalaq, Korra chooses to leave open the portals between the material world and the spirit world, allowing a new coexistence of spirits and humans.\\n The third season, Book Three: Change, begins as nonbenders begin developing airbending powers as a result of Harmonic Convergence, and Tenzin, Korra, and her friends attempt to recruit them to re-establish the extinct Air Nomads. One new airbender is Zaheer, the leader of the anarchist Red Lotus society. The Red Lotus assassinates the Earth Queen, throwing her kingdom into chaos, and captures Korra to attempt to kill her and end the Avatar cycle. They are defeated by Korra\\'s friends and the new airbenders, but Korra is severely injured and psychologically traumatized.\\n The final season, Book Four: Balance, takes place three years later. Korra slowly recovers from her mental and physical trauma. The metalbender Kuvira, assigned to reunite the fractured Earth Kingdom, declares herself head of the new, authoritarian \"Earth Empire\". Kuvira builds a spirit-powered superweapon and attempts to conquer Republic City. When Korra and her friends destroy the weapon, defeating Kuvira, the blast creates another portal to the Spirit World. The series ends with the prospect of democracy for the former Earth Kingdom, as Korra and Asami leave together for a vacation in the spirit world.\\n Korra (Janet Varney) is the series\\' 17-year-old \"headstrong and rebellious\" protagonist,[9] and Aang\\'s reincarnation as the Avatar. Her transformation \"from brash warrior to a spiritual being\", according to DiMartino, is a principal theme of the series.[10] The character was inspired by Bryan Konietzko\\'s \"pretty tough\" sister, and by female MMA fighters.\\n The series focuses on Korra and her friends, sometimes called \"Team Avatar\", which include the bending brothers Mako and Bolin and the non-bender Asami. Mako (David Faustino), the older brother, is a firebender described as \"dark and brooding\".[3][11] The character was named after the late Mako Iwamatsu, the voice actor for Iroh in the first two seasons of the original series. His younger brother Bolin (P. J. Byrne) is an earthbender described as lighthearted, humorous, and \"always [having] a lady on his arm\".[3][12] Asami Sato (Seychelle Gabriel), the only non-bender among the leading characters, is the daughter of the wealthy industrialist Hiroshi Sato.[3]\\n The other main characters are the airbending master Tenzin, one of Aang\\'s grown children (J. K. Simmons), and his family, which include his wife Pema (Maria Bamford) and their daughters Jinora (Kiernan Shipka) and Ikki (Darcy Rose Byrnes) and sons Meelo (Logan Wells) and Rohan. Jinora is calm and an avid reader. She is an airbender and joins the main cast in season 2.[13][14] Ikki is described as \"fun, crazy, and a fast talker\".[14] Little brother Meelo is super-active and comically aggressive, and baby Rohan is born during the third-to-last episode of Book One. Other recurring characters include Republic City police chief Lin Beifong (Mindy Sterling), and Korra\\'s animal friends Naga and Pabu (both Dee Bradley Baker, the voice of a number of animals including Appa and Momo in the original series). Pabu was inspired by Futa, a famous standing Japanese red panda.[15] Jeff Bennett as the voice for Shiro Shinobi, fast-talking probending match announcer in Book One. He also does the voice-overs for the short recaps during the opening sequence of each episode.\\n According to critic Mike Hoffman, the romantic interests of Korra and her companions are less in the foreground than in Avatar, and feature mainly in the first two seasons.[16] In Book One, Bolin pines for Korra, who is interested in Mako, who dates Asami. By the end of the season, Mako has broken up with Asami and entered a relationship with Korra. This ends around the end of Book Two, during which Bolin suffers from an abusive relationship with the waterbender Eska. In the fourth season, Bolin dates the airbender Opal, while Asami and Korra become closer friends. The series\\' final scene indicates a romantic connection between them.[17] Mike DiMartino wrote that the scene \"symbolizes their evolution from being friends to being a couple\".[18] They continue in a relationship in the comics.\\n Book One: Air features two main adversaries for Korra: the Equalists\\' masked leader Amon (Steve Blum) who has the power to remove a person\\'s bending-powers,[3][19] and the ambitious, charismatic politician Tarrlok (Dee Bradley Baker), who resorts to increasingly repressive methods against the Equalists.[20]  Tenzin\\'s parents Katara (Eva Marie Saint), and Avatar Aang (D. B. Sweeney), main characters of the Avatar: The Last Airbender series, also made recurring appearances. Chris Hardwick and Kate Higgins voiced Sokka and Toph Beifong in guest appearances. Amon\\'s lieutenant is voiced by Lance Henriksen, and Asami\\'s father Hiroshi Sato by Daniel Dae Kim. Sato\\'s character, the self-made founder of Future Industries, was inspired by Theodore Roosevelt and by the Japanese industrialists Keita Goto and Iwasaki Yatarō.[21] Rami Malek voices Tahno, a pro-bending athlete. Richard Epcar voices Saikhan, captain of the Republic City Metalbending Police Force. Both Amon and Tarrlok are identified as the sons of mob boss Yakone (Clancy Brown). Korra is also supported by General Iroh (Dante Basco, who voiced Zuko in the original series), a member of the United Forces who is described as \"a swashbuckling hero-type guy\".[22][23] He is named after Iroh, Zuko\\'s uncle in the original series.[24]\\n Book Two: Spirits features Tenzin\\'s and Korra\\'s families, including Tenzin\\'s elder siblings Kya (Lisa Edelstein) and Bumi (Richard Riehle) as well as Korra\\'s father Tonraq (James Remar) and mother Senna (Alex McKenna). Book 2 also introduces John Michael Higgins as the corrupt businessman and inventor Varrick, with Stephanie Sheh voicing his assistant Zhu Li, along with Korra\\'s uncle Unalaq (Adrian LaTourelle), aided by his twin children Desna (Aaron Himelstein) and Eska (Aubrey Plaza), and Vaatu (Jonathan Adams), the spirit of disorder. Spencer Garrett joined the cast as the voice for Raiko, the president of the United Republic. The season also explains the Avatar mythos though the first Avatar Wan (Steven Yeun) and Vaatu\\'s polar opposite Raava (April Stewart). Making a few appearances in Books Two and Three, Greg Baldwin reprises Iroh from the previous series. Set six months after the events of the first season, Book Two: Spirits sees Mako as a police officer, Asami in charge of Future Industries, and Bolin leading a new pro-bending team with little success.\\n The anarchist antagonists introduced in Book Three: Change, the Red Lotus, comprise the new airbender Zaheer (Henry Rollins), the armless waterbender Ming-Hua (Grey DeLisle, who previously voiced a dark spirit),[25] the combustionbender P\\'Li (Kristy Wu), and the lavabender Ghazan (Peter Giles). Supporting characters include the Earth Queen Hou-Ting (Jayne Taini), the retired Fire Lord Zuko (Bruce Davison), Lin\\'s half-sister Suyin Beifong (Anne Heche), Suyin\\'s trusted advisor Aiwei (Maurice LaMarche) and her captain of the guards Kuvira (Zelda Williams). New airbenders are also introduced in the season including the young thief Kai (Skyler Brigmann) and Suyin\\'s daughter Opal (Alyson Stoner), both of Earth Kingdom origins and the love interests of Jinora and Bolin respectively. Jim Meskimen voices a Republic City merchant and later airbender named Daw, as well as Suyin\\'s husband, the architect Baatar. Jason Marsden as the voice for Huan, second oldest son of Suyin, along Marcus Toji voicing  Wei and Wing are the twin sons of Suyin. Greg Cipes as the voice for Tu, the cousin of Mako and Bolin, along Susan Silo voices a their grandmother Yin.[citation needed]\\n The final season, Book Four: Balance, features Kuvira as Korra\\'s antagonist at the head of an army bent on uniting the Earth Kingdom. The cast is also joined by Sunil Malhotra as Prince Wu, the vain heir to the Earth Kingdom throne, and Todd Haberkorn as Baatar Jr., Suyin\\'s estranged son who is Kuvira\\'s fiancé and second-in-command. Philece Sampler voices the aged Toph Beifong, another returning character from Avatar whose young adult version was voiced by Kate Higgins in Books 1 and 3. April Stewart was cast as Zuko\\'s daughter, Fire Lord Izumi, in a minor role.[26]\\n The art design of Republic City, described as \"if Manhattan had happened in Asia\", was inspired by the 1920s and incorporates influences from American and European architecture from that time period.[7] Elements of film noir and steampunk also influenced the city\\'s art concept. The design for the metalbending police force is based on 1920s New York City police uniforms, crossed with samurai armor.[27]\\n The fighting styles employed by characters in the original show Avatar: The Last Airbender were derived from different distinct styles of Chinese martial arts.[28] Set 70 years later, the fighting style in the multicultural Republic City has modernized and blended,[29][30] with the creators incorporating three primary styles: traditional Chinese martial arts, mixed martial arts, and tricking. The pro-bending sport introduced in the series was inspired by mixed martial arts (MMA) tournaments.[27][31]\\n Chinese martial arts instructor Sifu Kisu consulted on Avatar: The Last Airbender and returned as a consultant for the fight scenes in The Legend of Korra. MMA fighters Jeremy Humphries and Mac Danzig were credited with \"providing a lot of the moves you\\'ll see in the Probending arena\", and Steve Harada and Jake Huang provided the stylized flips and acrobatics of \"tricking\" to the series\\' fighting style.[31]\\n The Legend of Korra was co-created and produced by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank, California. To illustrate the length of the production process (about 10 to 12 months per episode)[32] and the overlap of the various phases, Konietzko wrote in July 2013 that their team was already developing the storyboards for the first episode of Book 4 while the last episodes of Book 2 were not yet finished.[33]\\n Production of the series was announced at the annual San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, 2010. It was originally due for release in October 2011.[34][35] Tentatively titled Avatar: Legend of Korra at the time, it was intended to be a twelve-episode[36] mini series set in the same fictional universe as the original show,[35] but seventy years later.[37] In 2011, the title was changed to The Last Airbender: Legend of Korra, and again in March 2012 to The Legend of Korra. The premiere was eventually delayed to April 14, 2012.[36] South Korean animation studio Mir was involved in the pre-production, storyboarding and animation of the series which allows the studio more creative input on directing the martial arts scenes that the series and its predecessor are known for.[38]\\n According to animation director Yoo Jae-myung, Nickelodeon was initially reluctant to approve the series and suspended production because, according to Konietzko, conventional wisdom had it that \"girls will watch shows about boys, but boys won\\'t watch shows about girls\". The creators eventually persuaded the channel\\'s executives to change their mind. Konietzko related that in test screenings, boys said that Korra being a girl did not matter to them.[39]\\n The creators wrote all of the episodes of the first season themselves, omitting \"filler episodes\" to allow for a concise story.[40] Once the series was expanded from its original 12-episode schedule to 26 and then to 52, more writers were brought in so that the creators could focus on design work.[41] Joaquim Dos Santos and Ryu Ki-Hyun, who worked on the animation and design of the original series, also became involved with creating The Legend of Korra, as is storyboarder Ian Graham. Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, who composed the soundtrack for the original series as \"The Track Team,\" also returned to score The Legend of Korra.[42]\\n The second season, Book Two: Spirits, premiered on September 13, 2013, and concluded on November 22, 2013. It consists of fourteen episodes. Animation work was done by the South Korean animation studio Mir as well as the Japanese animation studio Pierrot.[1] Studio Mir was expected to solely work on Book 2, but executive director Jae-myung Yoo decided that Studio Mir would animate The Boondocks instead because the animation process was less rigorous. Pierrot was eventually called in to fill the void and animate Book 2. According to Jae-myung Yoo, Studio Mir was later contacted and re-asked to animate Book 2. Yoo feared that, if Book 2 failed, Studio Mir and Korean animators would have their reputations tarnished for Pierrot\\'s failures. Consequently, Studio Mir accepted the offer and worked alongside Pierrot.[43]\\n The third season, Book Three: Change, aired its first three episodes on June 27, 2014, soon after some episodes were leaked online.[44] It takes place two weeks after the events of Book Two: Spirits. Episodes nine to thirteen were streamed online, rather than being broadcast as a television program.[45]\\n Book Four: Balance, the final season, was produced in parallel to the previous two seasons. The crew, at one point, worked on approximately 30 episodes at the same time: post-production for season 2, production for season 3 and pre-production for season 4.[46] Some production steps, such as color correction and retakes, continued up until the date of the series finale, December 19, 2014.[47] Season 4 started online distribution a few months after the third season\\'s finale on October 3, 2014. After Nickelodeon cut the season\\'s budget by the amount required for one episode, DiMartino and Konietzko decided to include a clip show, which reuses previously produced animation, as episode 8 (\"Remembrances\") instead of dismissing many of the creative staff.[48] Studio Mir was helped by its companion studio, a subunit called Studio Reve, while working on Book 4.[49][50][51]\\n Concerning the development of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that at first he and DiMartino did not give the idea much weight, assuming they would not be able to get approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached the network and found them supportive up to a certain limit. They decided to change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding hands, to also facing each other in a pose referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior and the pose made by Aang and Katara in the finale of Avatar: The Last Airbender.[52]\\n The Legend of Korra was produced mainly as traditional animation, with most frames drawn on paper in South Korea by the animators at Studio Mir and scanned for digital processing. Each episode comprises about 15,000 drawings.[53] The series makes occasional use of computer-generated imagery for complex scenes or objects, most noticeably in the animations of the pro-bending arena or the mecha-suits of the later seasons.\\n While The Legend of Korra was produced in the United States and therefore not a work of Japanese animation (\"anime\") in the strict sense, The Escapist magazine argued that the series is so strongly influenced by anime that it would otherwise easily be classified as such: its protagonists (a superpowered heroine, her group of talented, supporting friends, a near-impervious villain who wants to reshape the world), its themes (family, friendship, romance, fear, and death) and the quality of its voice acting as well as the visual style are similar to those of leading anime series such as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Bleach or Trigun.[54] A notable difference from such series is the absence of lengthy opening and ending sequences set to J-pop songs;[54] to save broadcast time, The Legend of Korra\\'s openings and endings last only a few seconds. The series mostly abstains from using the visual tropes characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.\\n As in Avatar, the series adds to its Asian aesthetic by presenting all text that appears in its fictional world in traditional Chinese characters, without translating it. For example, on the \"Wanted\" posters seen in the episode \"The Stakeout\", the names of the protagonists are written as 寇拉 (Korra), 馬高 (Mako) and 愽林 (Bolin).\\n The Legend of Korra is set to music by Jeremy Zuckerman, who previously wrote the music for Avatar: The Last Airbender with Benjamin Wynn. For The Legend of Korra, Zuckerman is the sole composer while Wynn is the lead sound designer; the two collaborate with Foley artist Aran Tanchum and showrunner Mike DiMartino on the soundscape of the series.[55] Konietzko and DiMartino\\'s concept for the score was to blend traditional Chinese music with early jazz. On that basis, Zuckerman composed a score combining elements of Dixieland, traditional Chinese music and Western orchestration. It is performed mainly by a string sextet and various Chinese solo instruments,[56] including a dizi (flute), paigu (drums), a guqin, an erhu and a Mongolian matouqin.[57][58]\\n A soundtrack CD, The Legend of Korra: Original Music from Book One, was published on July 16, 2013.[59] Music from Korra and Avatar was also played in concert at the PlayFest festival in Málaga, Spain in September 2014.[60] The series\\'s soundtrack was nominated as best TV soundtrack for the 2013 GoldSpirit Awards.[61]\\n On July 16, 2013, Nickelodeon and Sony Music Entertainment\\'s Legacy Recordings released The Legend of Korra: Original Music from Book One.\\n The first season (Book One: Air) aired in the United States on Nickelodeon on Saturday mornings between April 14, 2012, and June 23, 2012. Unlike its predecessor, the series was broadcast in high-definition. It was broadcast in other countries on the local Nickelodeon channels beginning in August 2012.\\n The second season (Book Two: Spirits) began airing on Nickelodeon in the United States on September 13, 2013, on Friday evenings. The season ended on November 22, 2013.\\n The third season (Book Three: Change) began airing on Nickelodeon in the United States on June 27, 2014, also on Friday evenings, two episodes at a time. The broadcast was announced one week in advance after several episodes of the new season were leaked on the Internet. After the first seven episodes aired to low ratings, Nickelodeon removed the last five episodes from its broadcast schedule. The remainder of the episodes were then distributed online via Amazon Video, Google Play, Xbox Video and Hulu as well as the Nickelodeon site and apps.[62] The Escapist compared The Legend of Korra to Firefly as \"a Friday night genre series with a loyal fan following built up from previous works by the creators that is taken off the air after the network fails to advertise it properly or broadcast episodes in a logical manner.\"[2] Series creator Michael DiMartino said that the series\\' move to online distribution reflected a \"sea change\" in the industry: While Korra did not fit in well with Nickelodeon\\'s other programming, the series did extremely well online, with the season 2 finale having been Nickelodeon\\'s biggest online event.[63]\\n The fourth season (Book Four: Balance) began distribution in the United States on October 3, 2014, through Nick.com, Amazon Video, iTunes and Hulu.[64] Beginning on November 28, 2014, with episode 9, the fourth season was officially premiered back on television on Fridays on Nicktoons.[65]\\n The Legend of Korra is broadcast subtitled or dubbed on Nickelodeon channels outside of the U.S.\\n In Germany, the first and second seasons received a German-language broadcast on Nickelodeon Germany. The third and fourth seasons are broadcast in 2015 on the German Nicktoons pay TV channel. In France, only the first season has been broadcast on Nickelodeon France and J-One. A fandub project to complete the French dub was launched in 2015.[66]\\n In 2017, the Kenya Film Classification Board banned The Legend of Korra, together with the cartoon series The Loud House, Hey Arnold!, Steven Universe, Clarence and Adventure Time, from being broadcast in Kenya. According to the Board, the reason was that these series were \"glorifying homosexual behavior\".[67]\\n Since August 14, 2020, The Legend of Korra is available for streaming on Netflix in the United States.[68]\\n All episodes of the series have also been released through digital download services, DVD and Blu-ray formats. The DVD releases contain extra features such as audio commentary from the creators, cast and crew for some episodes, and the Blu-ray releases contain commentary for additional episodes.\\n The following table indicates the release dates of the DVD and Blu-ray versions of the series:\\n The series premiere averaged 4.5 million viewers, ranking it as basic cable\\'s number-one kids\\' show and top animated program for the week with total viewers. The Legend of Korra also ranks as the network\\'s most-watched animated series premiere in three years.[84]\\n Book One: Air drew an average of 3.8 million viewers per episode. This was the highest audience total for an animated series in the United States in 2012.[85]\\n Book Two: Spirits premiered with 2.6 million viewers. Suggested explanations for the reduced number of broadcast viewers were: the long period between seasons, a change in time slot (Friday evening instead of Saturday morning), the increased availability of digital download services, and generally reduced ratings for the Nickelodeon channel.[86]\\n Book Three: Change aired on short notice in June 2014 after Spanish-language versions of some episodes were leaked on the Internet. The season premiered with 1.5 million viewers.[44] After declining TV ratings in the third season, Nickelodeon stopped airing the series on its main network and shifted its distribution to sister channel, Nicktoons and online outlets. The online distribution is where the show had proven to be much more successful.[63][87]\\n The Legend of Korra received praise for its production values, the quality of its writing, its challenging themes and its transgression of the conventions of youth entertainment.\\n On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the show currently has an average score of 89%, based on critic reviews.[88] Its first season holds a score of 91% with an average rating of 8.25 out of 10, based on 11 critic reviews, with the website\\'s critical consensus saying, \"The Legend of Korra expands the world of Avatar: The Last Airbender with narrative substance and crisp animation – and progresses the drama and action with a female lead.\"[89] The second season holds a score of 67% with an average rating of 8.35 out of 10, based on 9 critic reviews.[90] Both Book Three: Change and Book 4: Balance receive the score of 100% based on 9 critic reviews, with average ratings of 9.5 out of 10 and 9 out of 10 respectively.[91][92]\\n David Hinckley of the New York Daily News wrote that the \"visually striking\" series is \"full of little tricks and nuances that only true fans will notice and savor, but nothing prevents civilians from enjoying it as well.\"[93] Writing for Vulture, Matt Patches highlighted the second season\\'s loose, handheld-style cinematography—challenging for an animated series—and the \"weird, wonderful\", wildly imagined spirits fought by Korra; \"a Kaiju parade with beasts that mirror velociraptors\".[94] Max Nicholson for IGN described the third season as \"easily the show\\'s most consistent season to date, delivering complex themes, excellent storylines and unmatched production values.\"[95] And Oliver Sava, for The A.V. Club, characterized it as a \"truly magnificent season of television, delivering loads of character development, world building, socio-political commentary, and heart-racing action, all presented with beautifully smooth animation and impeccable voice acting\".[96]\\n Before the first season\\'s finale, Scott Thill of Wired hailed The Legend of Korra as \"the smartest cartoon on TV,\" able to address adults\\' spiritual and sociopolitical concerns while presenting an \"alternately riveting and hilarious ride packed with fantasy naturalism, steampunk grandeur, kinetic conflicts, sci-fi weaponry and self-aware comedy.\"[97] In The Atlantic, Julie Beck characterized the series as \"some of the highest quality fantasy of our time\", appreciating it for combining nuanced social commentary with Avatar: The Last Airbender\\'s \"warmth, whimsy, and self-referential wit\".[98] Brian Lowry of Variety felt that the series \"represents a bit more ambitious storytelling for older kids, and perhaps a few adults with the geek gene.\"[99]\\n At TV.com, Noel Kirkpatrick commented favorably on how the second season of \"one of television\\'s best programs\" handled the necessary quantity of exposition, and on its introduction of the theme of conflict between spiritualism and secularism.[100] Covering the third season, Scott Thill at Salon described Korra as one of the toughest, most complex female characters on TV, despite being in a cartoon, and considered that the \"surreal, lovely sequel\" to Avatar \"lastingly and accessibly critiques power, gender, extinction, spirit and more\\xa0— all wrapped up in a kinetic \\'toon as lyrical and expansive as anything dreamt up by Hayao Miyazaki or George Lucas\".[101] David Levesley at The Daily Beast recommended the series to those looking for \"beautifully shot and well-written fantasy on television\" after the end of Game of Thrones\\'s most recent season, noting that in both series \"the fantastical and the outlandish are carefully balanced with human relationships and political intrigue\".[102]\\n Several reviewers noted the sociopolitical issues that, unusually for an animated series on a children\\'s channel, run through The Legend of Korra. According to Forbes, by telling \"some of the darkest, most mature stories\" ever animated, The Legend of Korra has created a new genre, \"the world\\'s first animated television drama\".[103] Thill proposed that the Equalists\\' cause in season 1 reflected the recent appearance of the Occupy movement, and DiMartino responded that though the series was written before Occupy Wall Street began, he agreed that the show similarly depicted \"a large group of people who felt powerless up against a relatively small group of people in power.\"[104] Beck wrote that The Legend of Korra used magic to illustrate \"the growing pains of a modernizing world seeing the rise of technology and capitalism, and taking halting, jerky steps toward self-governance\", while portraying no side of the conflict as entirely flawless.[98] Alyssa Rosenberg praised the show for examining issues of class in an urban setting, and a guest post in her column argued that the struggle between Korra and Amon\\'s Equalists reflected some of the ideas of John Rawls\\' \"luck egalitarianism\", praising the series for tackling moral issues of inequality and redistribution.[105][106]\\n Writing for The Escapist, Mike Hoffman noted how the series respected its younger viewers by explicitly showing, but also giving emotional weight to the death of major characters, including \"one of the most brutal and sudden deaths in children\\'s television\" in the case of P\\'Li in season 3. By portraying Korra\\'s opponents not as stereotypical villains, but as human beings with understandable motivations corrupted by an excess of zeal, the series trusted in viewers to be able to \"resolve the dissonance between understanding someone\\'s view and disagreeing with their methods\". And, Hoffman wrote, by showing Korra to suffer from \"full-on depression\" at the end of the third season, and devoting much of the fourth to her recovery, the series helped normalize mental health issues, a theme generally unaddressed in children\\'s television, which made them less oppressive for the viewers.[107]\\n Summing up Book Four, Joanna Robinson for Vanity Fair described it as \"the most subversive television event of the year\", noting how much of the season and series pushed the boundaries of what is nominally children\\'s television by \"breaking racial, sexual, and political ground\": It featured a dark-skinned female lead character as well as a bevy of diverse female characters of all ages, focused on challenging issues such as weapons of mass destruction, PTSD and fascism, and was infused with an Eastern spirituality based on tenets such as balance and mindfulness.[108] Levesley also highlighted the \"many examples of well-written women, predominantly of color\" in the series.[102] Oliver Sava at The A.V. Club noted that the series had \"consistently delivered captivating female figures\"; he considered it to be first and foremost about women, and about how they relate to each other \"as friends, family, and rivals in romance and politics\".[17]\\n Moreover, according to Robinson, the series\\' final scene, in which Korra and Asami gaze into each other\\'s eyes in a shot mirroring the composition of Avatar\\'s final moments in which Aang and Katara kiss, \"changed the face of TV\" by going further than any other work of children\\'s television in depicting same-sex relationships[108]—an assessment shared by reviewers for TV.com,[109] The A.V. Club,[17] USA Today,[110] IGN,[111] Moviepilot[112] and The Advocate.[113] Mike Hoffman, on the other hand, felt that Korra and Asami\\'s relationship was not intended as particularly subversive, but as something the writers trusted younger viewers, now often familiar with same-sex relationships, to be mature enough to understand.[107] Megan Farokhmanesh of Polygon wrote that by portraying Korra and Asami as bisexual, the series even avoided the error of assuming sexual orientation, as many other TV series did, to be a strict divide between \"gay\" and \"straight\".[114] In 2018, io9 ranked the series\\' final scene #55 on its list of \"The 100 Most Important Pop Culture Moments of the Last 10 Years\".[115] As Korra was made widely available again on Netflix in 2020, Janet Varney called her role as the voice of Korra \"the most profound and meaningful part of my career\" on account of the impact the ending had on queer fans.[68] Vanity Fair said that the show\\'s creators \"fought hard\" for the ending with Korra and Asami, which has \"plausible deniability that it\\'s all platonic.\"[116]\\n The Washington Post and Vulture have since credited The Legend of Korra with changing the landscape of LGBT representation in western animated children\\'s cartoons, paving the way for more overt queer content in shows such as Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power.[117][118]\\n The first season of The Legend of Korra received numerous accolades. It received two nominations for the 2012 Annie Awards; Bryan Konietzko, Joaquim Dos Santos Ryu Ki-Hyun, Kim Il Kwang and Kim Jin Sun were nominated in the category of Best Character Design in an Animated Television Production, and the first two episodes were nominated in the category of Best Animated Television Production for Children.[119] The series was also nominated for the \"Outstanding Children\\'s Program\" award from among the 2012 NAACP Image Awards, which \"celebrates the accomplishments of people of color\".[120] IGN editors and readers awarded the series the \"IGN People\\'s Choice Award\" and the \"Best TV Animated Series\" award in 2012, and it was also nominated for \"Best TV Series\" and \"Best TV Hero\" for Korra.[121] The series also took second place (after My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic) in a TV.com readers\\' poll for the \"Best Animated Series\" of 2012.[122] The first season also received three Daytime Emmy Award nominations, winning in the category of \"Outstanding Casting For an Animated Series or Special.\"\\n The second season received fewer awards and total nominations than the first; it was nominated for three Annie Awards in 2014, winning in the category of \"Outstanding Achievement, Production Design in an Animated TV/Broadcast Production.\" It was nominated for two more IGN awards, being nominated for \"Best TV Animated Series\" and winning the \"IGN People\\'s Choice Award\" for the second year in a row.[123]\\n The third and fourth seasons, combined into one entry, were nominated for six IGN awards, winning the \"People\\'s Choice Award\" for the third time in a row, as well as \"Best TV Animated Series\" for the second time, \"People\\'s Choice Award for Best TV Episode\" for Korra Alone, and \"People\\'s Choice Award for Best TV Series\" for the first time.[124] The third and fourth seasons were nominated for two Annie Awards; \"Best Animated TV/Broadcast Production for Children\\'s Audience,\" and winning \"Outstanding Achievement, Storyboarding in an Animated TV/Broadcast Production.\"\\n Like its predecessor series, The Legend of Korra has a broad fandom, including on social media and at fan conventions. Most fans are young adults, according to The Escapist, but many are children and younger teenagers.[107]\\n According to Merrill Barr writing for Forbes, few series \"boast as vocal a fan base as The Legend of Korra\", including such popular series as Game of Thrones and Orphan Black.[128] In January 2015, after the series ended, the media reported on a fan petition to have Netflix produce a series in the Avatar universe garnering more than 10,000 signatures only in 2015.[129]\\n The A.V. Club and io9 noted that the live-action TV series Warrior, for which NBC ordered a pilot in early 2015, has a premise almost identical to that of The Legend of Korra: It is to be about \"a damaged heroine\" who \"works undercover with physical and spiritual guidance from a mysterious martial arts master to bring down an international crime lord\" in a \"contemporary multicultural and sometimes magical milieu\".[130][131]\\n In an interview with GLAAD\\'s Raina Deerwater, ND Stevenson, creator of the series She-Ra and the Princesses of Power talked about queer representation in animation, situating The Legend of Korra alongside Steven Universe as an inspiring series that has taught young fans to expect \"nothing less than a variety of solid queer representation and central queer characters.\".[132]\\n The Legend of Korra is continued in a graphic novel trilogy series written by DiMartino and published by Dark Horse Comics. The first trilogy, The Legend of Korra: Turf Wars, was drawn by Irene Koh and takes place immediately following the series finale, focusing on Korra and Asami\\'s relationship in the aftermath of Kuvira\\'s attack. The first volume was published on July 26, 2017,[133] the second volume was published on January 17, 2018,[134] and the third and final volume was published on August 22, 2018.[135] A sequel, The Legend of Korra: Ruins of the Empire, was published in three volumes in May 2019, November 2019, and February 2020.[136]\\n Hardcover art books detailing each season\\'s creative process have been published by Dark Horse, similar to the art book published about Avatar: The Last Airbender:\\n In July 2013, Nickelodeon published a free interactive e-book, The Legend of Korra: Enhanced Experience, on iTunes.[141] It contained material such as concept art, character biographies, animatics and storyboards.[142]\\n In March 2013, PixelDrip Gallery organized a Legend of Korra fan art exhibition in Los Angeles with the support of the series\\'s creators, and later published a documentary video about it.[143] Another art exhibition supported by Nickelodeon to pay tribute to The Legend of Korra and Avatar was held from March 7 to 22, 2015 at Gallery Nucleus in Alhambra, California.[144][145]\\n An adult coloring book, The Legend of Korra Coloring Book (ISBN\\xa0978-1-5067-0246-9) with art by Jed Henry was released in July 2017.[146]\\n Book One: Air was adapted as two novels by Erica David, aimed at readers ages twelve and up. The novelizations were published by Random House in 2013:[147]\\n Activision published two video games based on the series in October 2014. The first, titled only The Legend of Korra, is a third-person beat \\'em up game for Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows. Despite the game\\'s developer PlatinumGames being known for well-received action games, the game received mixed reviews. The second game, The Legend of Korra: A New Era Begins, is a turn-based strategy game developed by Webfoot Technologies for the Nintendo 3DS. Nickelodeon also makes several Adobe Flash-based browser games based on The Legend of Korra available on their website.[148]\\n IDW Publishing released a series of board games based on The Legend of Korra. The first is an adaptation of the series\\' pro-bending game; that was financed through Kickstarter and released in fall 2017.[149] Korra is a playable character in multiple Nickelodeon crossover games, including Super Brawl Universe, Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix and 3: Slime Speedway, and Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl and its sequel.[150] Korra also appears as a skin for Skadi in Smite.[151]\\n A 12-inch figurine of Lin Beifong, as well as a graphic t-shirt, was announced at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con.[152] Mondo released a figurine of Korra and Asami holding hands in March 2018.[153]\\n In 2013, before the premiere of Book Two: Spirits, Nickelodeon released three animated short videos online titled Republic City Hustle that cover part of the lives of Mako and Bolin as street hustlers before the events of the first season.[154] They are written by Tim Hedrick, one of the writers for Book Two: Spirits, and designed by Evon Freeman.[155]\\n In August 2012, Variety reported that Paramount Animation, a sister company of Nickelodeon, was starting development of several animated films, with budgets of around US$100 million. According to Variety, a possible candidate for one of the films was The Legend of Korra.[156] Series creator Bryan Konietzko later wrote on his blog that no such film was in development.[157] In July 2013, he said that he and DiMartino were far too busy working on multiple seasons of the TV series in parallel to consider developing a film adaptation at that time.[158]', 'Le Petit Nicolas (Little Nicholas) is a series of French children\\'s books created by René Goscinny and illustrated by Jean-Jacques Sempé; its first installment was originally published on 29 March 1959. The books depict an idealized version of childhood in 1950s France.\\n The work started out as a comic strip, which initially ran in the Belgian magazine Le Moustique between 1956 and 1958, drawn by Sempé and written by Goscinny. The series was quick to draw attention. A few years later Goscinny began to write Le Petit Nicolas in short story form, with illustrations by Sempé. The first Nicolas story, L’œuf de Pâques, was published 29 March 1959 in the journal Sud-Ouest Dimanche. The authors hadn\\'t initially planned to continue the series but the sudden popularity of the comic kept them going. Thus, they continued to publish the comics in Sud-Ouest and Pilote until 1965.[1]\\n Thirty years after Goscinny\\'s death, his daughter Anne decided to publish his unreleased stories, creating new books out of ten stories. Sempé, who was unaware of this material, obliged by providing the illustrations.\\n The illustrations got turned into a feature film, Little Nicholas: Happy As Can Be from France’s Foliascope and Luxembourg’s Bidibul Productions that released on 16 December 2022. Amandine Fredon and Benjamin Massoubre (I Lost My Body) directed the feature based on the bestselling French children’s book series Le Petit Nicolas.[2]\\n The books are told from the point of view of Nicolas himself, which gives the book a distinct and personal sense of humour.  The narration is a pastiche of childish storytelling, with run-on sentences and schoolyard slang used in abundance, and much of the humour derives from Nicolas’s misunderstanding of adults\\' behaviour. At the same time, adults are as much a target of the book\\'s satire as children, as the straightforward and uncomplicated worldview of the child narrator exposes the flaws of adult perception. This subversive element in Le Petit Nicolas made it an early example of modern children\\'s literature that is centred on the experience of the child\\'s interpretation of the world, rather than an adult\\'s.\\n The characters from the French edition include (with names from Anthea Bell\\'s English translation in square brackets):\\n Other characters include Nicolas\\'s parents, as well as teachers and administrators in the school. The teacher is hard-working and loves the children, although they usually exasperate her. The superintendent, Mr. Dubon (Mr Goodman), is known as \"le Bouillon\" (\"Old Spuds\"). Mr Billings (Mr Blédurt) is their next door neighbour, and likes annoying Nicholas\\' father. \\n The two main characters of another comic series by Goscinny, Iznogoud, begin to take shape in the episode when Nicolas is in summer camp. He and the other children are forced to take a nap, so the counsellor tells them a story about \"a caliph who was a very good man but who had a very evil vizier...\", then tells how the caliph dresses as a common man to find out what people think of him, and the evil vizier takes his place.\\n An English edition with the title Young Nicolas was completed by Stella Rodway for Hutchinson & Co. in 1961. It was published in the USA by Bobbs-Merrill in 1962. The characters\\' names retain the French form. The title page lists the authors simply as \"Sempé and Goscinny\".\\n An English edition of the series with anglicised character names was released in 1978, translated by Anthea Bell. This contained five volumes: Nicholas and the Gang at School, Nicholas and the Gang Again, Nicholas on Holiday, Nicholas and the Gang, and Nicholas at Large. The first volume was republished with more complete illustrations in 2005 by Phaidon Press as Nicholas. Four further volumes followed from Phaidon, as Nicholas Again, Nicholas on Holiday (Nicholas on Vacation in North America), Nicholas and the Gang, and finally Nicholas in Trouble in 2008.\\n In this version, M. Dubon (nicknamed \"le Bouillon\") becomes Mr. Goodman (nicknamed \"Old Spuds\"). He derives his nickname from his habit of repeating constantly: \"Look me in the eye.\" In French broth (bouillon) has eyes (blobs of fat on the surface), in the English version they become potato eyes. In the story \\'Djodjo\\', the English exchange student George becomes a Belgian named Jochen, and his nickname is changed from \"Djodjo\" to \"Yocky\".\\n Another English translation of Le petit Nicolas, with the title The Chronicles of Little Nicholas, was published in New York by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 1993. The translator is not named in this edition; the copyright page attributes copyright for the translation to Farrar, Straus and Giroux.\\n Nicholas was the subject of a Mildred L. Batchelder Honour for translated children\\'s books in 2006 given by the Association for Library Services to Children (ALSC), a division of the American Library Association, and Nicholas and the Gang received the same honour in 2008', 'Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (also known as Alice Through the Looking-Glass or simply Through the Looking-Glass) is a novel published on 27 December 1871 (although it is indicated[where?] that the novel was published in 1872[1]) by Lewis Carroll, a mathematics lecturer at Christ Church, University of Oxford, and the sequel to Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland (1865). Alice again enters a fantastical world, this time by climbing through a mirror into the world that she can see beyond it. There she finds that, just like a reflection, everything is reversed, including logic (for example, running helps one remain stationary, walking away from something brings one towards it, chessmen are alive, nursery rhyme characters exist, and so on).\\n Through the Looking-Glass includes such verses as \"Jabberwocky\" and \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\", and the episode involving Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The mirror above the fireplace that is displayed at Hetton Lawn in Charlton Kings, Gloucestershire (a house that was owned by Alice Liddell\\'s grandparents, and was often visited by Alice and Lewis Carroll) resembles the one drawn by John Tenniel, and is cited as a possible inspiration for Carroll.[2] The novel prompted a new-found appreciation for its predecessor when it was published.[3]\\n Alice is playing with a white kitten (whom she calls \"Snowdrop\") and a black kitten (whom she calls \"Kitty\") while pondering what the world is like on the other side of a mirror\\'s reflection. Climbing up onto a mantelpiece, she pokes at the wall-hung mirror behind a fireplace and discovers, to her surprise, that she can step through it. She finds herself in a reflected version of her own house and notices a book with looking-glass poetry, \"Jabberwocky\", whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror. She also observes that the chess pieces have come to life, though they remain small enough for her to pick up.\\n Upon leaving the house (where it had been a cold, snowy night), she enters a sunny spring garden where the flowers can speak. Elsewhere in the garden, Alice meets the Red Queen, who is now human-sized, and who impresses Alice with her ability to run at breathtaking speeds.\\n The Red Queen reveals that the entire countryside is laid out in squares, like a gigantic chessboard, and offers to make Alice a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank in a chess match. Alice is placed in the second rank as one of the White Queen\\'s pawns, and begins her journey across the chessboard by boarding a train that jumps over the third row and directly into the fourth rank, thus acting on the rule that pawns can advance two spaces on their first move. She arrives in a forest where a gnat teaches her about the looking glass insects, creatures part bug part object (e.g., bread and butterfly, rocking horse fly), before flying away. Continuing her journey, Alice crosses the \"wood where things have no names\". There she forgets all nouns, including her own name. With the help of a fawn who has also forgotten his identity, she makes it to the other side, where they both remember everything. Realizing that he is a fawn, she is a human, and that fawns are afraid of humans, it runs off.\\n \\nShe then meets the twin brothers Tweedledum and Tweedledee, whom she knows from the nursery rhyme. After reciting a poem, they draw Alice\\'s attention to the Red King—sleeping under a nearby tree—and provoke her with idle philosophical banter that she is but an imaginary figure in his dreams. The brothers begin suiting up for battle, only to be frightened away by an enormous crow, as the nursery rhyme about them predicts. Alice next meets the White Queen, who is absent-minded but can remember future events before they have happened. Alice and the White Queen advance into the chessboard\\'s fifth rank by crossing over a brook together, but at the very moment of the crossing, the Queen transforms into a talking Sheep in a small shop. Alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat, where the Sheep annoys her with shouting about \"crabs\" and \"feathers\".\\n After crossing another brook into the sixth rank, Alice encounters Humpty Dumpty, who, besides celebrating his unbirthday, provides his own translation of the strange terms in \"Jabberwocky\". In the process, he introduces Alice to the concept of portmanteau words, before his inevitable fall.\\n All the king\\'s horses and all the king\\'s men come to Humpty Dumpty\\'s assistance, and are accompanied by the White King, along with the Lion and the Unicorn, who proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting with each other. The March Hare and Hatter[a] appear in the guise of \"Anglo-Saxon messengers\" called \"Haigha\" and \"Hatta\".\\n Upon leaving the Lion and Unicorn to their fight, Alice reaches the seventh rank by crossing another brook into the forested territory of the Red Knight, who wants to capture the \"white pawn\"—Alice—until the White Knight comes to her rescue. Escorting her through the forest towards the final brook-crossing, the Knight recites a poem of his own composition and repeatedly falls off his horse.\\n Bidding farewell to the White Knight, Alice steps across the last brook, and is automatically crowned a queen, with the crown materialising abruptly on her head.[b] She soon finds herself in the company of both the White and Red Queens, who confound Alice by using word play to thwart her attempts at logical discussion. They then invite one another to a party that will be hosted by Alice—of which Alice herself had no prior knowledge.\\n Alice arrives and seats herself at her own party, which quickly turns into chaos. Alice grabs the Red Queen, believing her to be responsible for all the day\\'s nonsense, and begins shaking her.\\n Alice awakes in her armchair to find herself holding Kitty, whom she deduces to have been the Red Queen all along, with Snowdrop having been the White Queen. Alice then recalls the speculation of the Tweedle brothers, that everything may have been a dream of the Red King, and that Alice might be a figment of his imagination.\\n One of the key motifs of Through the Looking-Glass is that of mirrors, including the use of opposites, time running backwards, and so on, not to mention the title of the book itself. In fact, the themes and settings of the book make it somewhat of a mirror image of its predecessor, Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland (1865). The first book begins in the warm outdoors, on 4 May;[c] uses frequent changes in size as a plot device; and draws on the imagery of playing cards. The second book, however, opens indoors on a snowy, wintry night exactly six months later, on 4 November (the day before Guy Fawkes Night);[d] uses frequent changes in time and spatial directions as a plot device; and draws on the imagery of chess.\\n While the first Alice novel took playing cards as a theme, Through the Looking-Glass instead used chess; most of the main characters are represented by chess pieces, with Alice being a pawn. The looking-glass world consists of square fields divided by brooks or streams, and the crossing of each brook typically signifies a change in scene, with Alice advancing one square. At the book\\'s beginning, Carroll provided and explained a chess composition with descriptive notation, corresponding to the events of the story. Although the piece movements follow the rules of chess, other basic rules are ignored: one player (White) makes several consecutive moves while the (Red/Black) opponent\\'s moves are skipped, and a late check (12... Qe8+) is left undealt with. Carroll also explained that certain items listed in the composition do not have corresponding piece moves but simply refer to the story, e.g. the \"castling of the three Queens, which is merely a way of saying that they entered the palace\". Despite these liberties, the final position is an authentic checkmate.\\n The most extensive treatment of the chess motif in Carroll\\'s novel was made by Glen Downey in his master\\'s thesis, later expanded and incorporated into his dissertation on the use of chess as a device in Victorian fiction. In the former piece, Downey gave the composition\\'s moves in algebraic notation: 1... Qh5 2. d4 3. Qc4 4. Qc5 5. d5 6. Qf8 7. d6 8. Qc8 9. d7 Ne7+ 10. Nxe7 11. Nf5 12. d8=Q Qe8+ 13. Qa6 14. Qxe8#.[4] In the latter piece, Downey treated the 21 items in the composition sequentially, identifying the above 16 coherent chess moves, and another five items as \"non-moves\" or pure story descriptors, per Carroll\\'s qualification.[5]\\n The mating position nearly satisfies the conditions of a pure mate, a special type of checkmate where the mated king is prevented from moving to any of the adjacent squares in its field by exactly one enemy attack, among other conditions. The position is also nearly an ideal mate, a stronger form of pure mate in which every piece on the board of either colour contributes to the checkmate. The one feature of the position which prevents it from being either a pure or an ideal mate is that the Red (Black) King is unable to move to e3 for two reasons: the knight\\'s attack, and the (sustained) attack of the newly promoted, mating queen. Although pure and ideal mates are \"incidental\" in real games, they are objects of aesthetic interest to composers of chess problems.[6]\\n The White Queen offers to hire Alice as her lady\\'s maid and to pay her \"twopence a week, and jam every other day\". Alice says that she does not want any jam today, to which the Queen replies, \"you couldn\\'t have it if you did want it. The rule is, jam tomorrow and jam yesterday—but never jam to-day.\" This is a reference to the rule in Latin that the word iam or jam—which means now, in the sense of already or at that time—cannot be used to describe now in the present, which is nunc in Latin. Therefore, \"jam\" is never available today.[7] This exchange is also a demonstration of the logical fallacy of equivocation.[8]\\n \\nMost poems and songs in the book do not include a title. Lewis Carroll decided to suppress a scene involving what was described as \"a wasp in a wig\" (possibly a play on the commonplace expression \"bee in the bonnet\"). A biography of Carroll, written by Carroll\\'s nephew, Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, suggests that one of the reasons for this suppression was a suggestion from his illustrator, John Tenniel,[11] who wrote in a letter to Carroll dated 1 June 1870:[12]\\n I am bound to say that the  \\'wasp\\'  chapter doesn\\'t interest me in the least, and I can\\'t see my way to a picture. If you want to shorten the book, I can\\'t help thinking—with all submission—that there is your opportunity. For many years, no one had any idea what this missing section was or whether it had survived. In 1974, a document purporting to be the galley proofs of the missing section was auctioned at Sotheby\\'s; the catalogue description, in part, read, \"the proofs were bought at the sale of the author\\'s…personal effects…Oxford, 1898\". The document would be won by John Fleming, a Manhattan book dealer, for a bid of about US$832 (equivalent to $5,140 in 2023).[13] The contents were subsequently published in Martin Gardner\\'s More Annotated Alice (1990),[14] and are also available as a hardback book.[15]\\n The rediscovered section describes Alice\\'s encounter with a wasp wearing a yellow wig, and includes a full previously unpublished poem. If included in the book, it would have followed, or been included at the end of, Chapter 8—the chapter featuring the encounter with the White Knight. The discovery is generally accepted as genuine, but the proofs have yet to receive any physical examination to establish age and authenticity.[16]\\n The missing episode was included in the 1998 TV film adaptation Alice through the Looking Glass, with the character being portrayed by Ian Richardson. It was also included in the 2010 graphic novel \"The Complete Alice in Wonderland\".\\n The book has been adapted several times, both in combination with Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland and as a stand-alone feature.', 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a 1964 children\\'s novel by British author Roald Dahl. The story features the adventures of young Charlie Bucket inside the chocolate factory of eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka.[1]\\n The story was originally inspired by Roald Dahl\\'s experience of chocolate companies during his schooldays at Repton School in Derbyshire. Cadbury would often send test packages to the schoolchildren in exchange for their opinions on the new products.[2] At that time (around the 1920s), Cadbury and Rowntree\\'s were England\\'s two largest chocolate makers and they each often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies, posing as employees, into the other\\'s factory—inspiring Dahl\\'s idea for the recipe-thieving spies (such as Wonka\\'s rival Slugworth) depicted in the book.[3] Because of this, both companies became highly protective of their chocolate-making processes. It was a combination of this secrecy and the elaborate, often gigantic, machines in the factory that inspired Dahl to write the story.[4]\\n Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is frequently ranked among the most popular works in children\\'s literature.[5][6][7] In 2012, Charlie Bucket brandishing a Golden Ticket appeared in a Royal Mail first class stamp in the UK.[8] The novel was first published in the U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. in 1964 and in the U.K. by George Allen & Unwin 11 months later. The book\\'s sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, was written by Dahl in 1971 and published in 1972. Dahl had also planned to write a third book in the series but never finished it.[9]\\n The book has also been adapted into two major motion pictures: Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory in 1971 and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 2005. A stand-alone film exploring Willy Wonka\\'s origins titled Wonka was released in 2023. The book has spawned a media franchise with multiple video games, theatrical productions and merchandise. \\n Charlie Bucket lives in poverty with his parents and grandparents in a town which is home to a world-famous chocolate factory. One day, Charlie\\'s bedridden Grandpa Joe tells him about Willy Wonka, the factory\\'s eccentric owner, and all of his fantastical candies. Rival chocolatiers sent in spies to steal his recipes, forcing Wonka to close the factory and disappear. He reopened the factory years later, but the gates remain locked, and nobody knows who is providing the factory with its workforce.\\n The next day, the newspaper announces that Wonka has hidden five Golden Tickets in Wonka Bars; the finders of these tickets will be invited to come and tour the factory. The first four tickets are found by gluttonous Augustus Gloop, spoiled Veruca Salt, compulsive gum-chewer Violet Beauregarde, and television addict Mike Teavee. One day, Charlie buys two Wonka Bars with some money he found in the snow. When he opens the second, Charlie discovers that the second bar he bought contains the fifth and final ticket. Upon hearing the news, Grandpa Joe regains his mobility and volunteers to accompany Charlie to the factory.\\n On the day of the tour, Wonka welcomes the five children and their parents inside the factory, a wonderland of confectionery creations that defy logic. They also meet the Oompa-Loompas, a race of impish humanoids who help him operate the factory as a thanks for his rescuing them from a land of dangerous monsters. During the tour, the other children besides Charlie give in to their impulses and are ejected from the tour in darkly comical ways: Augustus falls into the Chocolate River and is sucked up a pipe, Violet swells into a giant human blueberry after chewing an experimental stick of three-course dinner gum ending with a blueberry pie flavor, Veruca and her parents fall down a garbage chute after the former tries to capture one of the nut-testing squirrels, and Mike is shrunk down to the size of a chocolate bar after misusing the Television Chocolate device despite Wonka\\'s warnings. The Oompa-Loompas sing about the children\\'s misbehaviour each time disaster strikes.\\n With only Charlie remaining, Wonka congratulates him for \"winning\" the factory. Wonka explains that the whole tour was designed to help him find a worthy heir to his business, and Charlie was the only child whose inherent genuineness passed the test. They ride the Great Glass Elevator and watch the other four children leave the factory before flying to Charlie\\'s house, where Wonka invites the entire Bucket family to come and live with him in the factory.\\n Dahl\\'s widow said that Charlie was originally written as \"a little black boy though this thought to be a falsehood.\" Dahl\\'s biographer said the change to a white character was driven by Dahl\\'s agent, who thought a black Charlie would not appeal to readers.[10][11]\\n In the first published edition, the Oompa-Loompas were described as African pygmies, and were drawn this way in the original printed edition.[10] After the announcement of a film adaptation sparked a statement from the NAACP, which expressed concern that the transportation of Oompa-Loompas to Wonka\\'s factory resembled slavery, Dahl found himself sympathising with their concerns and published a revised edition.[10] In this edition, as well as the subsequent sequel, the Oompa-Loompas were drawn as being white and appearing similar to hippies, and the references to Africa were deleted.[10]\\n In 2023, publisher Puffin made more than eighty additional changes to the original text of the book, such as: removing every occurrence of the word fat (including referring to Augustus Gloop as \"enormous\" rather than \"enormously fat\" and greatly changing the words of his song); removing most references to the Oompa-Loompa\\'s diminutive size and physical appearance and omitting descriptions of them living in trees and wearing deerskins and leaves; removing or changing the words mad, crazy, and queer; omitting many references to Mike Teavee\\'s toy guns; and removing references to corporal punishment (such as changing \"She needs a really good spanking\" to \"She needs a really good talking to\" and \"She wants a good kick in the pants\" to \"She needs to learn some manners\").[12][13]\\n Mr Wonka turned around and clicked his fingers sharply, click, click, click, three times. Immediately, an Oompa-Loompa appeared, as if from nowhere, and stood beside him.\\n The Oompa-Loompa bowed and smiled, showing beautiful white teeth. His skin was almost pure black, and the top of his fuzzy head came just above the height of Mr Wonka\\'s knee. He wore the usual deerskin slung over his shoulder.\\n \\'Now listen to me,\\' said Mr Wonka, looking down at the tiny man.\\n Mr Wonka turned around and clicked his fingers sharply, click, click, click, three times.

In the initial, unpublished drafts of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory nine golden tickets were distributed to tour Willy Wonka\\'s secret chocolate factory[15] and the children faced more rooms and more temptations to test their self-control.[15][16] Some of the names of the children cut from the final work include:[17]\\n \"Spotty Powder\" was first published as a short story in 1973.[21][23] In 1998, it was included in the children\\'s horror anthology Scary! Stories That Will Make You Scream edited by Peter Haining. The brief note before the story described the story as having been left out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory due to an already brimming number of misbehaving children characters in the tale. In 2005, The Times reprinted \"Spotty Powder\" as a \"lost\" chapter, saying that it had been found in Dahl\\'s desk, written backwards in mirror writing (the same way that Leonardo da Vinci wrote in his journals).[16][24] Spotty Powder looks and tastes like sugar, but causes bright red pox-like spots to appear on faces and necks five seconds after ingestion, so children who eat Spotty Powder do not have to go to school. The spots fade on their own a few hours later. After learning the purpose of Spotty Powder, the humourless, smug Miranda Piker and her equally humourless father (a schoolmaster) are enraged and disappear into the Spotty Powder room to sabotage the machine. Soon after entering, they are heard making what Mrs. Piker interprets as screams. Mr. Wonka assures her (after making a brief joke where he claims that headmasters are one of the occasional ingredients) that it is only laughter. Exactly what happens to them is not revealed in the extract.[15][16]\\n In an early draft, sometime after being renamed from Miranda Grope to Miranda Piker, but before \"Spotty Powder\" was written, she falls down the chocolate waterfall and ends up in the Peanut-Brittle Mixer. This results in the \"rude and disobedient little kid\" becoming \"quite delicious.\"[21][25] This early draft poem was slightly rewritten as an Oompa-Loompa song in the lost chapter, which now puts her in the \"Spotty-Powder mixer\" and instead of being \"crunchy and ... good [peanut brittle]\" she is now \"useful [for truancy] and ... good.\"[16]\\n In 2014, The Guardian revealed that Dahl had removed another chapter (\"The Vanilla Fudge Room\") from an early draft of the book. The Guardian reported the now-eliminated passage was \"deemed too wild, subversive and insufficiently moral for the tender minds of British children almost 50 years ago.\"[15] In what was originally chapter five in that version of the book, Charlie goes to the factory with his mother instead of Grandpa Joe as originally published. At this point, the chocolate factory tour is down to eight kids,[22][26] including Tommy Troutbeck and Wilbur Rice. After the entire group climbs to the top of the titular fudge mountain, eating vanilla fudge along the way, Troutbeck and Rice decide to take a ride on the wagons carrying away chunks of fudge. The wagons take them directly to the Pounding And Cutting Room, where the fudge is reformed and sliced into small squares for retail sale. Wonka states the machine is equipped with \"a large wire strainer ... which is used specially for catching children before they fall into the machine\" adding that \"It always catches them. At least it always has up to now.\"[22]\\n The chapter dates back to an early draft with ten golden tickets, including one each for Miranda Grope and Augustus Pottle, who fell into the chocolate river prior to the events of \"Fudge Mountain\".[15][27] Augustus Pottle was routed to the Chocolate Fudge Room, not the Vanilla Fudge Room explored in this chapter,[22][26] and Miranda Grope ended up in the Fruit and Nuts Room.\\n Also in 2014, Vanity Fair published a plot summary of \"The Warming Candy Room\", wherein three boys eat too many \"warming candies\" and end up \"bursting with heat.\"[28]\\n The Warming Candy Room is dominated by a boiler, which heats a scarlet liquid. The liquid is dispensed one drop at a time, where it cools and forms a hard shell, storing the heat and \"by a magic process ... the hot heat changes into an amazing thing called \\'cold heat.\\'\" After eating a single warming candy, one could stand naked in the snow comfortably. This is met with predictable disbelief from Clarence Crump, Bertie Upside, and Terence Roper, who proceed to eat at least 100 warming candies each, resulting in profuse perspiration. The three boys and their families discontinue the tour after they are taken to cool off \"in the large refrigerator for a few hours.\"[19]\\n Dahl originally planned for a child called Marvin Prune to be included. He submitted the excised chapter regarding Prune to The Horn Book Review in the early 1970s.[29] Rather than publish the chapter, Horn Book responded with a critical essay by novelist Eleanor Cameron, who called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory “one of the most tasteless books ever written for children”.[30]\\n In a 2006 list for the Royal Society of Literature, author J. K. Rowling (author of the Harry Potter books) named Charlie and the Chocolate Factory among her top ten books that every child should read.[31] A fan of the book since childhood, film director Tim Burton wrote: \"I responded to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory because it respected the fact that children can be adults.\"[32][33]\\n A 2004 study found that it was a common read-aloud book for fourth-graders in schools in San Diego County, California.[34] A 2012 survey by the University of Worcester determined that it was one of the most common books that UK adults had read as children, after Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and The Wind in the Willows.[35]\\n Groups who have praised the book include:\\n In the 2012 survey published by SLJ, a monthly with primarily US audience, Charlie was the second of four books by Dahl among their Top 100 Chapter Books, one more than any other writer.[40] Time magazine in the US included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time; it was one of three Dahl novels on the list, more than any other author.[41] In 2016 the novel topped the list of Amazon\\'s best-selling children\\'s books by Dahl in Print and on Kindle.[42] In 2023, the novel was ranked by BBC at no. 18 in their poll of \"The 100 greatest children\\'s books of all time\".[43]\\n Although the book has always been popular and considered a children\\'s classic by many literary critics, a number of prominent individuals have spoken unfavourably of the novel over the years.[44] Children\\'s novelist and literary historian John Rowe Townsend has described the book as \"fantasy of an almost literally nauseating kind\" and accused it of \"astonishing insensitivity\" regarding the original portrayal of the Oompa-Loompas as African black pygmies, although Dahl did revise this in later editions.[45] Another novelist, Eleanor Cameron, compared the book to the sweets that form its subject matter, commenting that it is \"delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare.\"[30]\\nUrsula K. Le Guin wrote in support of this assessment in a letter to The Horn Book Review, saying that her own daughter would turn \"quite nasty\" upon finishing the book.[46] Dahl responded to Cameron\\'s criticisms by noting that the classics that she had cited would not be well received by contemporary children.[47]\\n Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has frequently been adapted for other media, including games, radio, the screen,[48] and stage, most often as plays or musicals for children\\xa0– often titled Willy Wonka or Willy Wonka, Jr. and almost always featuring musical numbers by all the main characters (Wonka, Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Violet, Veruca, etc.); many of the songs are revised versions from the 1971 film.\\n The book was first made into a feature film as a musical, titled Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), directed by Mel Stuart, produced by David L. Wolper, and starring Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, character actor Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, and Peter Ostrum as Charlie Bucket, with music by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley. Dahl was credited for writing the screenplay, but David Seltzer was brought in by Stuart and Wolper to make changes against Dahl\\'s wishes, leaving his original adaptation, in one critic\\'s opinion, \"scarcely detectable\".[49] Amongst other things, Dahl was unhappy with the foregrounding of Wonka over Charlie, and disliked the musical score. Because of this, Dahl disowned the film.[49] The film had an estimated budget of $2.9\\xa0million but grossed only $4\\xa0million and was considered a box-office disappointment, though it received positive reviews from critics. Home video and DVD sales, as well as repeated television airings, resulted in the film subsequently becoming a cult classic.[50] Concurrently with the 1971 film, the Quaker Oats Company introduced a line of candies whose marketing uses the book\\'s characters and imagery.[51]\\n Warner Bros. and the Dahl estate reached an agreement in 1998 to produce another film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with the Dahl family receiving total artistic control. The project languished in development hell until Tim Burton signed on to direct in 2003. The film, titled Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, starred Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. It was released in 2005 to positive reviews and massive box office returns, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of the year.[52]\\n In October 2016, Variety reported that Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to the Willy Wonka character from the Roald Dahl Estate and would be planning a new film centered on the eccentric character with David Heyman producing.[53] In February 2018, Paul King entered final negotiations to direct the film.[54] In May 2021, it was reported that the film would be a musical titled Wonka, with Timothée Chalamet playing a younger version of the titular character in an origin story.[55] King was confirmed as director and co-writer along with comedian Simon Farnaby; the film was released globally in December 2023.[56]\\n On 27 November 2018, Netflix and The Roald Dahl Story Company jointly announced that Netflix would be producing an animated series based on Dahl\\'s books, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG, The Twits, and other titles. Production commenced on the first of the Netflix Dahl animated series in 2019.[70] On 5 March 2020, Variety announced that Taika Waititi was partnering with Netflix on a pair of animated series — one based on the world of \\'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and another based on the Oompa-Loompa characters. “The shows will retain the quintessential spirit and tone of the original story while building out the world and characters far beyond the pages of the Dahl book for the very first time,” Netflix said.[71] On 23 February 2022, Mikros Animation revealed that they would be producing a new collaboration with Netflix. The collaboration was announced as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The long-format animated event series is based on the 1964 novel and is written, directed and executive produced by Waititi.[72][73]\\n The book has been recorded a number of times:\\n Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has undergone numerous editions and been illustrated by numerous artists.[80]\\n The cover photo of the 50th anniversary edition, published by Penguin Modern Classics for sale in the UK and aimed at the adult market, received widespread commentary and criticism.[82]  The cover is a photo of a heavily made up young girl seated on her mother\\'s knee and wearing a doll-like expression, taken by the photographers Sofia Sanchez and Mauro Mongiello as part of a photo shoot for a 2008 fashion article in a French magazine, for a fashion article titled \"Mommie Dearest.\"[81][83] In addition to writing that \"the image seemingly has little to do with the beloved children\\'s classic\",[84] reviewers and commentators in social media (such as posters on the publisher\\'s Facebook page) have said the art evokes Lolita, Valley of the Dolls, and JonBenet Ramsey; looks like a scene from Toddlers & Tiaras; and is \"misleading,\" \"creepy,\" \"sexualised,\" \"grotesque,\" \"misjudged on every level,\" \"distasteful and disrespectful to a gifted author and his work,\" \"pretentious,\" \"trashy\", \"outright inappropriate,\" \"terrifying,\" \"really obnoxious,\" and \"weird & kind of paedophilic.\"[81][85][86]\\n The publisher explained its objective in a blog post accompanying the announcement about the jacket art: \"This new image .\\u2009.\\u2009. looks at the children at the center of the story, and highlights the way Roald Dahl’s writing manages to embrace both the light and the dark aspects of life.\"[87] Additionally, Penguin Press\\'s Helen Conford told the Bookseller: \"We wanted something that spoke about the other qualities in the book.  It\\'s a children\\'s story that also steps outside children\\'s and people aren\\'t used to seeing Dahl in that way.\" She continued: \"[There is] a lot of ill feeling about it, I think because it\\'s such a treasured book and a book which isn\\'t really a \\'crossover book\\'\" As she acknowledged: \"People want it to remain as a children\\'s book.\"\\n The New Yorker describes what it calls this \"strangely but tellingly misbegotten\" cover design thusly: \"The image is a photograph, taken from a French fashion shoot, of a glassy-eyed, heavily made-up little girl. Behind her sits, a mother figure, stiff and coiffed, casting an ominous shadow. The girl, with her long, perfectly waved platinum-blond hair and her pink feather boa, looks like a pretty and inert doll—\" The article continues: \"And if the Stepford daughter on the cover is meant to remind us of Veruca Salt or Violet Beauregarde, she doesn\\'t: those badly behaved squirts are bubbling over with rude life.\" Moreover, writes Talbot, \"The Modern Classics cover has not a whiff of this validation of childish imagination; instead, it seems to imply a deviant adult audience.\"[82]', 'The Iron Giant is a 1999 American animated science fiction film produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation and distributed by Warner Bros. It is based on the 1968 novel The Iron Man by Ted Hughes (which was published in the United States as The Iron Giant). The film is directed by Brad Bird (in his directorial debut) and produced by Allison Abbate and Des McAnuff, from a screenplay written by Tim McCanlies, and based on a story treatment by Bird. The film stars the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Cloris Leachman, John Mahoney, Eli Marienthal, Christopher McDonald, and M. Emmet Walsh. Set during the Cold War in 1957, the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant alien robot. With the help of a beatnik artist named Dean McCoppin, Hogarth attempts to prevent the U.S. military and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal agent, from finding and destroying the Giant.\\n The film\\'s development began in 1994 as a musical with the involvement of the Who\\'s Pete Townshend, though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The film was animated using traditional animation, with computer-generated imagery used to animate the Iron Giant and other effects. The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features. Michael Kamen composed the film\\'s score, which was performed by the Czech Philharmonic. It was the final film by Warner Bros. Feature Animation to be fully animated and not a live-action/animation hybrid.\\n The Iron Giant premiered at Mann\\'s Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999, and was released in the United States on August 6. The film significantly underperformed at the box office, grossing $31.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million, which was attributed to Warner Bros.\\' lack of marketing and skepticism towards animated film production following the box office failure of Quest for Camelot in the preceding year. Despite this, the film was praised for its story, animation, musical score, characters, the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances of Aniston, Connick, Diesel, Mahoney, Marienthal, and McDonald. The film was nominated for several awards, winning nine Annie Awards out of 15 nominations. Through home video releases and television syndication, the film gathered a cult following[7] and is widely regarded as a modern animated classic, and one of the greatest animated films ever made.[8][9][10] In 2015, an extended, remastered version of the film was re-released theatrically,[8][11] and on home video the following year.[12][13]\\n In October 1957, during the Cold War, an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell.\\n The following night, nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object, a 50-foot-tall alien robot; he runs away but then returns to save the robot when he gets electrocuted while trying to eat the transmission lines of an electrical substation. Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding him docile and curious. When he eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, the train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the area, discovering that he can self-repair. While there, Hogarth shows the Giant comic books and compares him to the hero Superman.\\n The incidents lead paranoid U.S. government agent Kent Mansley to Rockwell. He suspects Hogarth\\'s involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother, Annie, and rents a room in their house to keep an eye on him. Hogarth evades Mansley and leads the Giant to a junkyard owned by beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys his time with the Giant but is compelled to explain the concept of death to the Giant after he witnesses hunters killing a deer.\\n Hogarth is detained and interrogated by Mansley when he discovers evidence of the Giant after finding a photo of him next to Hogarth and summons a U.S. Army contingent led by General Shannon Rogard to the scrapyard to prove the Giant\\'s existence, but Dean (having been warned by Hogarth earlier) tricks them by pretending that the Giant is one of his art pieces. Later, while playing with a toy gun, Hogarth inadvertently activates the Giant\\'s defensive system, firing a laser beam in the process. Dean yells at him for nearly killing Hogarth, and the saddened Giant runs away with Hogarth giving chase. Dean realizes that the Giant was only acting in self-defense and catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant.\\n The Giant rescues two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, winning over the townspeople. Mansley spots the Giant in the town while leaving Rockwell and has the Army attack the Giant after he has picked up Hogarth, forcing the two to flee. They initially evade the military by using the Giant\\'s flight system, but the Giant is shot down and crashes to the ground.\\n Hogarth is knocked unconscious, but the Giant assumes that Hogarth is dead, and in a fit of rage and grief transforms into a war machine and returns to Rockwell. Mansley convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the USS Nautilus, as conventional weapons prove to be ineffective. Hogarth awakens and returns in time to calm the Giant while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard.\\n Rogard is ready to stand down and order the Nautilus to deactivate its primed nuke, but a panicked Mansley snatches Rogard\\'s radio and orders the missile launch. The missile is targeted to hit Rockwell, where it will destroy the town upon impact in the resulting nuclear detonation. Mansley attempts to escape, but the Giant intervenes, and Rogard has Mansley arrested. To save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. As he soars into the missile\\'s path, the Giant remembers Hogarth\\'s words, \"You are who you choose to be,\" smiles contentedly, and declares himself \"Superman\" as he collides with the weapon. The missile explodes in the atmosphere, saving Rockwell, its population, and the military forces nearby, while the Giant is presumably destroyed, leaving Hogarth, Dean, Annie, and Rogard devastated.\\n Months later, Dean and Annie, now a couple, have a chat at a memorial of the Giant made by Dean, standing in Rockwell.  Hogarth is given a package from Rogard containing a screw from the Giant, which is the only remnant found. That night, Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and, remembering the Giant\\'s ability to self-repair, happily allows the screw to leave.\\n The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant\\'s head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland, and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself.\\n In addition, Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas voice the train\\'s engineers briefly seen near the start of the film. Johnston and Thomas, who were animators and members of Disney\\'s Nine Old Men, were cited by Bird as inspirations for his career, which he honored by incorporating their voices, likenesses, and first names into the film.[16]\\n The origins of the film lie in the book The Iron Man (1968), by poet Ted Hughes, who wrote the novel for his children to comfort them in the wake of their mother Sylvia Plath\\'s suicide. In the 1980s, rock musician Pete Townshend chose to adapt the book for a concept album; it was released as The Iron Man: A Musical in 1989.[18] In 1991, Richard Bazley, who later became the film\\'s lead animator, pitched a version of The Iron Man to Don Bluth while working at his studio in Ireland. He created a story outline and character designs but Bluth passed on the project.[14] After a stage musical was mounted in London, Des McAnuff, who had adapted Tommy with Townshend for the stage, believed that The Iron Man could translate to the screen, and the project was ultimately acquired by Warner Bros. Entertainment.[18]\\n In late 1996, while developing the project on its way through, the studio saw the film as a perfect vehicle for Brad Bird, who at the time was working for Turner Feature Animation developing Ray Gunn.[18] Turner Broadcasting had recently merged with Warner Bros. parent company Time Warner, and Bird was allowed to transfer to the Warner Bros. Animation studio to direct The Iron Giant.[18] After reading the original Iron Man book by Hughes, Bird was impressed with the mythology of the story and in addition, was given an unusual amount of creative control by Warner Bros.[18] This creative control involved introducing two new characters not present in the original book, Dean and Kent, setting the film in America, and discarding Townshend\\'s musical ambitions (who did not care either way, reportedly remarking, \"Well, whatever, I got paid\").[19][20] Bird would expand upon his desire to set the film in America in the 1950s in a later interview:\\n The Maine setting looks Norman Rockwell idyllic on the outside, but inside everything is just about to boil over; everyone was scared of the bomb, the Russians, Sputnik — even rock and roll. This clenched Ward Cleaver smile masking fear (which is really what the Kent character was all about). It was the perfect environment to drop a 50-foot-tall robot into.[20] Ted Hughes, the original story\\'s author, died before the film\\'s release. His daughter, Frieda Hughes, saw the finished film on his behalf and loved it. Townshend, who stayed on as the film\\'s executive producer, enjoyed the final film as well.[21]\\n Tim McCanlies was hired to write the script, though Bird was somewhat displeased with having another writer on board, as he wanted to write the screenplay himself.[19] He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies\\' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions.[18] In Bird\\'s original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies decided to have a brief scene displaying his survival, stating, \"You can\\'t kill E.T. and then not bring him back.\"[19] McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film\\'s tight schedule that Warner Bros. \"didn\\'t have time to mess with us\" as McCanlies said.[22] The question of the Giant\\'s backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth.[23] Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as \"paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling\".[20] Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies\\' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, \"I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done. He\\'s made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He\\'s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he\\'s developed The Iron Giant. I can\\'t stop thinking about it.\"[18]\\n Bird combined his knowledge from his years in television to direct his first feature. He credited his time working on Family Dog as essential to team-building, and his tenure on The Simpsons as an example of working under strict deadlines.[20] He was open to others on his staff to help develop the film; he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly.[24] One of his priorities was to emphasize softer, character-based moments, as opposed to more frenetic scenes—something Bird thought was a problem with modern filmmaking. \"There has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring. It\\'s almost as if the audience has the remote and they\\'re going to change channels,\" he commented at the time.[23] Storyboard artist Teddy Newton played an important role in shaping the film\\'s story. Newton\\'s first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the \"hygiene-type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening.\" Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative, and the \"Duck and Cover\" sequence came to become one of the crew members\\' favorites of the film.[16] Nicknamed \"The X-Factor\" by story department head Jeffery Lynch, the producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of the film\\'s script.[25]\\n The financial failure of Warner\\'s previous animated effort, Quest for Camelot, which made the studio reconsider animated films, helped shape The Iron Giant\\'s production considerably. \"Three-quarters\" of the animation team on that film helped craft The Iron Giant.[23] By the time it entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff that there would be a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented \"They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good.\" Bird regarded the trade-off as having \"one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule\" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as \"fully-made by the animation team; I don\\'t think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.\"[23] A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to Maine, where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; \"we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees\", said production designer Mark Whiting.[26]\\n Bird stuck to elaborate scene planning, such as detailed animatics, to make sure there were no budgetary concerns.[23] The team initially worked with Macromedia\\'s Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team—dubbed \"Macro\" early on—to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that \"We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources.\"[27] The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film.[14] Bird cited his favorite moment of the film\\'s production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. \"People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something,\" he recalled.[20]\\n He opted to give the film\\'s animators portions to animate entirely, rather than the standard process of animating one character, in a throwback to the way Disney\\'s first features were created.[24][28] The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself, who was created using computer-generated imagery due to the difficulty of creating a metal object \"in a fluid-like manner\".[18] They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion.[24] The Giant consisted of 7000 parts (the Battle Giant had 10,000 parts),[29] and was designed by filmmaker Joe Johnston and refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski, head animator for the Giant.[23] Using software, the team would animate the Giant \"on twos\" (every other frame, or twelve frames per second) when interacting with other characters, to make it less obvious it was a computer model.[23] Bird brought in students from CalArts to assist in minor animation work due to the film\\'s busy schedule. He made sure to spread out the work on scenes between experienced and younger animators, noting, \"You overburden your strongest people and underburden the others [if you let your top talent monopolize the best assignments].\"[24] Hiroki Itokazu designed all of the film\\'s CGI props and vehicles, which were created in a variety of software, including Alias Systems Corporation\\'s Maya, Alias\\' PowerAnimator, a modified version of Pixar\\'s RenderMan, Softimage 3D, Cambridge Animation\\'s Animo (now part of Toon Boom Technologies), Avid Elastic Reality, and Adobe Photoshop.[30]\\n The art of Norman Rockwell, Edward Hopper and N.C. Wyeth inspired the design. Whiting strove for colors both evocative of the time period in which the film is set and also representative of its emotional tone; for example, Hogarth\\'s room is designed to reflect his \"youth and sense of wonder\".[26] That was blended with a style reminiscent of 1950s illustration. Animators studied Chuck Jones, Hank Ketcham, Al Hirschfeld and Disney films from that era, such as 101 Dalmatians, for inspiration in the film\\'s animation.[28]\\n The score for the film was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen, making it the only film directed by Bird not to be scored by his future collaborator, Michael Giacchino. Bird\\'s original temp score, \"a collection of Bernard Herrmann cues from \\'50s and \\'60s sci-fi films,\" initially scared Kamen.[31] Believing the sound of the orchestra is important to the feeling of the film, Kamen \"decided to comb eastern Europe for an \"old-fashioned\" sounding orchestra and went to Prague to hear Vladimir Ashkenazy conduct the Czech Philharmonic in Strauss\\'s An Alpine Symphony.\" Eventually, the Czech Philharmonic was the orchestra used for the film\\'s score, with Bird describing the symphony orchestra as \"an amazing collection of musicians\".[32] The score for The Iron Giant was recorded in a rather unconventional manner, compared to most films: recorded over one week at the Rudolfinum in Prague, the music was recorded without conventional uses of syncing the music, in a method Kamen described in a 1999 interview as \"[being able to] play the music as if it were a piece of classical repertoire.\"[31] Kamen\\'s score for The Iron Giant won the Annie Award for Music in an Animated Feature Production on November 6, 1999.[33]\\n Bird opted to produce The Iron Giant in widescreen—specifically the wide 2.39:1 CinemaScope aspect ratio—but was warned against doing so by his advisers. He felt it was appropriate to use the format, as many films from the late 1950s were produced in such widescreen formats.[34] He hoped to include the CinemaScope logo on a poster, partially as a joke, but 20th Century Fox, owner of the trademark, refused.[35]\\n Bird later recalled that he clashed with executives who wished to add characters, such as a sidekick dog, set the film in the present day, and include a soundtrack of hip hop.[36] This was due to concerns that the film was not merchandisable, to which Bird responded, \"If they were interested in telling the story, they should let it be what it wants to be.\"[23] The film was also initially going to be released under the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment banner, the logo which features mascot Bugs Bunny in a tuxedo eating a carrot as seen in the film\\'s teaser trailer. Bird was against this for a multitude of reasons, mainly because he felt that the logo did not fit the tone of the movie, and eventually got confirmation that executives Bob Daley and Terry Semel agreed. Instead, Bird and his team developed another version of the logo to resemble the classic studio logo in a circle, famously employed in Looney Tunes shorts.[36] He credited executives Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Courtney Vallenti with helping him achieve his vision, noting that they were open to his opinion.[23]\\n According to a report from the time of its release, The Iron Giant cost $50 million to produce with an additional $30 million going towards marketing,[6] though Box Office Mojo later reported its budget as $70 million.[37] It was regarded as a lower-budget film, in comparison to the films distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.[38]\\n When he began work on the film, Bird was in the midst of coping with the death of his sister, Susan, who was shot and killed by her estranged husband. In researching its source material, he learned that Hughes wrote The Iron Man as a means of comforting his children after his wife, Sylvia Plath, died by suicide, specifically through the metaphor of the title character being able to re-assemble itself after being damaged. These experiences formed the basis of Bird\\'s pitch to Warner Bros., which was based around the idea \"What if a gun had a soul, and didn\\'t want to be a gun?\"; the completed film was also dedicated to Hughes and Susan.[39][40] McCanlies commented that \"at a certain point, there are deciding moments when we pick who we want to be. And that plays out for the rest of your life\", adding that films can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong, and expressed a wish that The Iron Giant would \"make us feel like we\\'re all part of humanity [which] is something we need to feel.\"[22] When some critics compared the film to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Bird responded by saying \"E.T. doesn\\'t go kicking ass. He doesn\\'t make the Army pay. Certainly you risk having your hip credentials taken away if you want to evoke anything sad or genuinely heartfelt.\"[34]\\n We had toy people and all of that kind of material ready to go, but all of that takes a year! Burger King and the like wanted to be involved. In April we showed them the movie, and we were on time. They said, \"You\\'ll never be ready on time.\" No, we were ready on time. We showed it to them in April and they said, \"We\\'ll put it out in a couple of months.\" That\\'s a major studio, they have 30 movies a year, and they just throw them off the dock and see if they either sink or swim, because they\\'ve got the next one in right behind it. After they saw the reviews they [Warner Bros.] were a little shamefaced.\\n — Writer Tim McCanlies on Warner Bros.\\' marketing approach[19] The Iron Giant was a commercial failure during its theatrical release; consensus among critics was that its failure was, in part, due to lack of promotion from Warner Bros. This was largely attributable to the reception of Quest for Camelot; after its release, Warner would not give Bird and his team a release date for their film until April 1999.[41][42] After wildly successful test screenings, the studio was shocked by the response: the test scores were their highest for a film in 15 years, according to Bird.[20] They had neglected to prepare a successful marketing strategy for the film—such as cereal and fast food tie-ins—with little time left before its scheduled release. Bird remembered that the studio produced one teaser poster for the film, which became its eventual poster.[36] Brad Ball, who had been assigned the role of marketing the film, was candid after its release, noting that the studio did not commit to a planned Burger King toy plan.[43] IGN stated that \"In a mis-marketing campaign of epic proportions at the hands of Warner Bros., they simply didn\\'t realize what they had on their hands.\"[44]\\n The studio needed an $8 million opening to ensure success, but they were unable to properly promote it preceding the release. They nearly delayed the film by several months to better prepare. \"They said, \\'we should delay it and properly lead up to its release,\\' and I said \\'you guys have had two and a half years to get ready for this,\\'\" recalled Bird.[36] Press outlets took note of its absence of marketing,[45] with some reporting that the studio had spent more money on marketing for the intended summer blockbuster Wild Wild West instead.[24][41] Warner Bros. scheduled Sunday sneak preview screenings for the film prior to its release,[46] as well as a preview of the film on the online platform Webcastsneak.[47]\\n After criticism that it mounted an ineffective marketing campaign for its theatrical release, Warner Bros. revamped its advertising strategy for the video release of the film, including tie-ins with Honey Nut Cheerios, AOL and General Motors[48] and secured the backing of three U.S. congressmen (Ed Markey, Mark Foley and Howard Berman).[49] Awareness of the film was increased by its February 2000 release as a pay-per-view title, which also increased traffic to the film\\'s website.[50]\\n The Iron Giant was released on VHS and DVD on November 23, 1999,[35] with a Laserdisc release following on December 6. Warner Bros. spent $35 million to market the home video release of the film.[51] The VHS edition came in three versions—pan and scan, pan and scan with an affixed Giant toy to the clamshell case, and a widescreen version. All of the initial widescreen home video releases were in 1.85:1, the incorrect aspect ratio for the film.[35] In 2000, television rights to the film were sold to Cartoon Network and TNT for $3 million. Cartoon Network showed the film continuously for 24 consecutive hours in the early 2000s for such holidays as the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving.[52][53]\\n The Special Edition DVD was released on November 16, 2004.[54] In 2014, Bird entered discussions with Warner Bros. regarding the possibility of releasing The Iron Giant on Blu-ray. On April 23, he wrote on Twitter that \"WB & I have been talking. But they want a bare-bones disc. I want better,\" and encouraged fans to send tweets to Warner Home Video in favor of a Special Edition Blu-ray of the film.[55] The film was ultimately released on Blu-ray on September 6, 2016, and included both the theatrical and 2015 Signature Edition cuts, as well as a documentary entitled The Giant\\'s Dream that covered the making of the film.[56] This version also received a DVD release months earlier on February 16 with The Giant\\'s Dream documentary removed.[12] This film became available on HBO Max on November 1, 2020.\\n The Iron Giant received critical acclaim.[57] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating based on 142 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The website\\'s critics consensus reads, \"The endearing Iron Giant tackles ambitious topics and complex human relationships with a steady hand and beautifully animated direction from Brad Bird.\"[58] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 85 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[59] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[60] The Reel Source forecasting service calculated that \"96–97%\" of audiences that attended recommended the film.[46]\\n Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it \"straight-arrow and subversive, [and] made with simplicity as well as sophistication,\" writing, \"it feels like a classic even though it\\'s just out of the box.\"[61] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, and compared it, both in story and animation, to the works of Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki: \"Like the new Japanese animated films, The Iron Giant is happy to be a \\'real movie\\' in everything but live action. There are no cute little animals and not a single musical number: It\\'s a story, plain and simple... It works as a lot of animation does, to make you forget from time to time that these are moving drawings, because the story and characters are so compelling.\" He concluded that it was \"not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say.\"[62] The New Yorker reviewer Michael Sragow dubbed it a \"modern fairy tale\", writing, \"The movie provides a master class in the use of scale and perspective—and in its power to open up a viewer\\'s heart and mind.\"[63] Time\\'s Richard Schickel deemed it \"a smart live-and-let-live parable, full of glancing, acute observations on all kinds of big subjects—life, death, the military-industrial complex.\"[64] Lawrence Van Gelder, writing for The New York Times, deemed it a \"smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking.\"[65] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal felt it \"beautiful, oh so beautiful, as a work of coherent art\", noting, \"be assured that the film is, before anything else, deliciously funny and deeply affecting\".[66]\\n Both Hollywood trade publications were positive: David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter predicted it to be a sleeper hit and called it \"outstanding\",[67] while Lael Loewenstein of Variety called it \"a visually appealing, well-crafted film [...] an unalloyed success.\"[68] Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly commented, \"I have long thought that I was born without the gene that would allow me to be emotionally drawn in by drawings. That is, until I saw The Iron Giant.\"[69] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films, and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes.[70] Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle agreed with the basic techniques as well, and concluded the voice cast excelled with a great script by Tim McCanlies.[71] The Washington Post\\'s Stephen Hunter, while giving the film 4 out of 5 stars, opined, \"The movie — as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is — has the annoyance of incredible smugness.\"[72]\\n The Iron Giant opened at Mann\\'s Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999, with a special ceremony preceding the screening in which a concrete slab bearing the title character\\'s footprint was commemorated.[73] The film opened in Los Angeles and New York City on August 4, 1999,[47] with a wider national release occurring on August 6 in the United States. It opened in 2,179 theaters in the U.S., ranking at number nine at the box office accumulating $5.7 million over its opening weekend.[74] It was quick to drop out of the top ten; by its fourth week, it had accumulated only $18.9 million—far under its reported $50 million budget.[6][5][74] According to Dave McNary of the Los Angeles Daily News, \"Its weekend per-theater average was only $2,631, an average of $145 or perhaps 30 tickets per showing\"—leading theater owners to quickly discard the film.[46] At the time, Warner Bros. was shaken by the resignations of executives Bob Daly and Terry Semel, making the failure much worse.[46] T.L. Stanley of Brandweek cited it as an example of how media tie-ins were now essential to guaranteeing a film\\'s success.[6]\\n The film went on to gross $23.2 million domestically and $8.1 million internationally for a total of $31.3 million worldwide.[37][5] Analysts deemed it a victim of poor timing and \"a severe miscalculation of how to attract an audience.\"[46] Lorenzo di Bonaventura, president of Warner Bros. at the time, explained, \"People always say to me, \\'Why don\\'t you make smarter family movies?\\' The lesson is, Every time you do, you get slaughtered.\"[75]\\n \\nThe Hugo Awards nominated The Iron Giant for Best Dramatic Presentation,[76] while the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America honored Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies with the Nebula Award nomination.[77] The British Academy of Film and Television Arts gave the film a Children\\'s Award as Best Feature Film.[78] In addition The Iron Giant won nine Annie Awards out of fifteen nominations, winning every category it was nominated for,[79] with another nomination for Best Home Video Release at The Saturn Awards.[80] IGN ranked The Iron Giant as the fifth favorite animated film of all time in a list published in 2010.[81] In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated The Iron Giant for its Top 10 Animated Films list.[82]\\n The film has gathered a cult following since its original release.[44] In 2018, when questioned over social media if there was ever a possibility of a sequel, Bird stated that because the film was considered a financial failure, a sequel was not likely to ever happen, but he also stressed that he considered the story of The Iron Giant to be completely self-contained in the film and saw no need for extending the story.[83]\\n The Cartoon Network series Mad, did a parody of the movie as well as the film The Iron Lady for their Season 3 premiere entitled The Iron Giant Lady. In the sketch, British prime minister Margaret Thatcher is the Giant and inspires other gynoids to take positions of political power.\\n In the Season 7 episode of Futurama entitled \"Assie Come Home\", the Iron Giant\\'s head can be seen in Yuri\\'s chop-shop in Filthytown.\\n The designers of the 2015 video game Ori and the Blind Forest were guided by inspirations from the film and Disney\\'s The Lion King.[84]\\n In the Lego Movie spin-off series Unikitty!, the episode entitled \"Kaiju Kitty\" references the film\\'s climatic moment of the Giant being blown up by the missile.\\n The Iron Giant appears in Steven Spielberg\\'s 2018 science fiction film Ready Player One.[85][86] Aech had collected the parts of the Iron Giant, which she later controlled during the Battle of Castle Anorak, where he teams up with Gundam to fight Mechagodzilla. After the Iron Giant sacrifices itself and falls into a pool of lava, it gives a thumbs up to Wade and his crew while it sinks into the lava paying direct homage to the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day when the T-800 gives the thumbs up to both John & Sarah Connor as it sacrifices itself into the molten steel.\\n The Iron Giant appears in Malcolm D. Lee\\'s 2021 basketball film Space Jam: A New Legacy.[87] He is among the characters in the Warner Bros. 3000 Entertainment Server-Verse that watches the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad.

He is among the remains of Blockbuster Island.\\n Beto Tlahuetl, director of the Mexican music band \"Grupo Soñador\", stated that he was inspired by the movie to write the song \"El Gigante de Hierro\" (The Iron Giant) after dreaming of the Giant dancing in Los Angeles streets. The lyrics emphasize the theme of never giving up on a daughter\\'s love by being the biggest protector.[88]\\n A remastered and extended cut of the film, named the Signature Edition, was shown in one-off screenings across the United States and Canada on September 30, 2015, and October 4, 2015.[89] The edition is approximately two minutes longer than the original cut, and features a brief scene with Annie and Dean in the cafe and the Giant\\'s dream sequence.[90] Both scenes were storyboarded by Bird during the production on the original film, but could not be finished due to time and budget constraints. Before they were fully completed for this new version, they were presented as deleted storyboard sequences on the 2004 DVD bonus features.[89] They were animated in 2015 by Duncan Studio, which employed several animators that worked on the original film, under Bird\\'s supervision.[89] The film\\'s Signature Edition was released on DVD and for digital download on February 16, 2016,[12] with an official Blu-ray release of this cut following on September 6.[13] Along with the additional scenes, it also showcases abandoned ideas that were not initially used due to copyright reasons, specifically a nod to Disney via a Tomorrowland commercial, which was also a reference to his then-recently released film of the same name, and a reference regarding the film being shot with CinemaScope cameras.[16]\\n On March 14, 2016, coinciding with the release of the Signature Edition, it was announced that The Art of the Iron Giant would be written by Ramin Zahed and published by Insight Editions, featuring concept art and other materials from the film.[91]', 'Mia and the Migoo (French: Mia et le Migou, Italian: Mià e il Migù) is a 2008 French-Italian animated film produced by Folimage and directed by Jacques-Rémy Girerd.

The story\\'s central theme is \"parent and child\",[4] depicting 13 years in the life of a young woman, Hana, who falls in love with a werewolf while in college, and following his death must raise the resulting half-wolf half-human children, Ame and Yuki, who grow and find their own paths in life.\\n Hosoda established Studio Chizu for production. Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, of Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (1990) and Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995), designed the characters. Wolf Children had its world premiere in Paris on June 25, 2012, and was released theatrically on July 21, 2012, in Japan.[5] Funimation licenses the film for North America[6] and Manga Entertainment handles UK rights.\\n In Tokyo, Hana falls in love with an enigmatic man during her second year of college, who eventually reveals himself to be a wolf man. They later have two children, a daughter named Yuki (Snow) and a son named Ame (Rain). Their father is killed in an accident while hunting for food shortly after Ame\\'s birth.\\n Hana\\'s life as a single mother is difficult; she has to hide the children as they constantly switch between their human and wolf forms, and they often get into fights. After she receives noise complaints and a visit from social services who are concerned that the children have not had vaccinations, Hana moves the family to the countryside away from prying neighbors. She works hard to repair a dilapidated house, but struggles to sustain the family on their own crops. With help from a strict old man named Nirasaki, she learns to farm sufficiently and befriends some of the locals.\\n One day, Ame almost drowns in a river while trying to hunt a kingfisher. Yuki rescues him, and Ame becomes more confident in his wolf abilities. Yuki begs her mother to enroll her in a public school, and Hana accepts on the condition that Yuki keeps her wolf nature secret. Yuki soon makes friends at school while Ame is bullied by his school peers. Meanwhile, Ame often skips school and becomes more interested in the forest and takes lessons from an elderly fox about survival in the wild.\\n In fourth grade, Yuki\\'s class receives a new transfer student, Sōhei, who realizes something is unusual about her. When he pursues the matter by cornering her, Yuki gets increasingly angry, leading her to transform into a wolf and inadvertently injuring his ear. At the meeting with their parents and teachers, Sōhei claims a wolf attacked him, absolving Yuki of the blame, and the two become friends.\\nYuki chastises Ame for not going to school. When he refuses, they get into a physical fight.\\n Two years later, the elementary school is let out early due to treacherous weather. As Hana is about to leave to retrieve her, Ame disappears into the forest to help his dying fox teacher, and Hana follows him. Yuki and Sōhei are left alone at school. Yuki reveals her ability to Sōhei and confesses that it was really her who attacked him. He tells her he already knew, and promises to keep her secret.\\n While searching for Ame, Hana slips and falls off a cliff. She sees a vision of the children\\'s father telling her that Yuki and Ame will find their own paths in life, and that she raised them well. Ame finds Hana and carries her to safety. She awakens to see him fully transform into an adult wolf and run off into the mountains. Realizing he has found his own path, she happily but tearfully accepts his goodbye.\\n One year later, Yuki leaves home to move into a middle school dormitory. Ame\\'s wolf howls are heard far and wide in the forest. Hana, now living alone, reflects that raising her wolf children was like a fairy tale, and feels proud of the way she raised them.\\n One of Hosoda\\'s motivations for working on this film was that people around him had started raising children, and he \"saw them shining as they became parents.\" In an interview with Anime! Anime! in February 2013, Hosoda explained why he chose the setting of Wolf Children despite the fact that it is a story about raising a child: \"It is generally taken for granted that children are raised and then grow up. But for the actual people involved, it is not natural at all. In order for the audience to share this feeling, I thought it would be good if we all shared an experience that no one else had (raising a werewolf child).\"[7]\\n In an interview with Famitsu, Hosoda said, \"I used to take it for granted that people would have children. However, after getting married, I began to realize that raising children in the city is a hardship in terms of the environment, such as public support, and that living in the countryside is not necessarily easy, and that there is a hardship of not having anyone of the same age. I wanted to make a film about such endurance.\" Human parenting cannot be done in complete isolation, and the reason for choosing wolves as the material for the project was that \"wolves are very family-oriented, and they are disciplined animals that have a leader who leads the pack and lives with the whole group in mind.\"[8]\\n The setting of the early part of the story, \"a national university on the outskirts of Tokyo,\" is modeled after Hitotsubashi University in Kunitachi, Tokyo.[9][10] In addition, the countryside where Hana moves to is modeled after the undeveloped woodland in Toyama Prefecture. The backdrop of the film depicts the landscape of Nakaniikawa District\\'s Kamiichi, Hosoda\\'s hometown, and the neighboring town of Tateyama, and it was divulged that the former mayor of Kamiichi, Naoshi Itō, approached Hosoda to \"make a film based on the town\". The old house that served as the model for Hana\\'s house was a private home owned by Masao Yamazaki, who lived in Kamiichi. In 2007, five years before the movie was released, Yamazaki passed away, and the house was considered for demolition, but it was chosen as the model for Hana\\'s house, and after the movie became a big hit, it was opened to the public by the owners (relatives of Yamazaki) and volunteers (as of 2015).[11] The elementary school that Ame and Yuki attended was modeled after Tanaka Elementary School (only the gymnasium is still in existence). The yakitori with sauce that appears in the film is oidare yakitori, a local dish from Ueda, Nagano, where Hosoda\\'s wife\\'s parents live.\\n At a press conference held on June 18, 2012, the director Mamoru Hosoda announced that Wolf Children would be released in 34 countries and territories.[12] This film\\'s premiere was in France on June 25, 2012, marking its international debut.[13]\\n It was subsequently released in Japan on July 21, 2012.[13] The film\\'s Blu-ray and DVD release date for Japan was February 20, 2013. The film had a limited release in the United States on September 27, 2013.[14]\\n Wolf Children was screened at Animefest 2013 in May in the Czech Republic[15] and at Animafest Zagreb 2013 in June in Croatia.[16]\\n In addition to the film, two novelizations and a manga written by Hosoda (with art by Yū (優)) were released by Kadokawa Shoten.[17] The manga was translated into English by Yen Press and was nominated for the Best U.S. Edition of International Material—Asia category at the 2015 Eisner Awards.[18] As tie-ins to the film, a film picture book, an art book, and a storyboard book were released from Kadokawa, Media Pal, and Pia.\\n Wolf Children was the second-highest-grossing film in Japan on its debut weekend of July 21–22, 2012, beating Pixar\\'s animation Brave, which debuted in Japan on the same weekend.[23] It attracted an audience of 276,326 throughout the weekend, grossing 365.14 million yen.[23] The film subsequently surpassed Hosoda\\'s previous work Summer Wars\\' gross of around 1.6 billion yen during the weekend of August 12–13, 2012.[24] In total, Wolf Children grossed 4.2 billion yen, making it the fifth-highest-grossing movie in Japan in 2012.[25]\\n The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 95% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 19 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10.[26] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 based on 8 critics, signifying \"generally favorable reviews\".[27]\\n Mark Schilling of The Japan Times gave the film three out of five stars and wrote that \"The Miyazaki influence on Hosoda\\'s own work seems obvious, from his cute-but-realistic style to his concern with pressing social issues and the messy emotions of actual human beings\". He felt the film was \"on the conventional and predictable side ... appealing to Jane Eyre fans in one scene, Call of the Wild fans in the next\" and criticized its \"well-worn, stereotypical rails\".[28]\\n Thomas Sotinel of Le Monde gave the film five out of five stars.[29] Dave Chua of Mypaper also praised the film\\'s \"magnificent understated eye for detail, from the grain of wood on doors to the lovingly captured forest scenes, that help lift the movie above regular animation fare\".[30] Chris Michael of The Guardian gave the film four out of five, writing that \"telling the story through the eyes of the harried, bereaved but indomitable mother gives this calm, funny, only occasionally schmaltzy family film a maturity Twilight never reached\".[31] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described it as \"an odd story, told in a one-of-a-kind style that feels equal parts sentimental, somber and strange\", and felt the English language performances were inappropriately sweet and simplistic.[32] Steven D. Greydanus, writing in the National Catholic Register, named the film a runner-up in its list of the best films of 2013, writing: \"Despite brief early problematic content and an ambiguous climactic letdown, the main story is magic\".[33]\\n Wolf Children won the 2013 Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year,[34] the 2012 Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film,[35] and the 2013 Animation of the Year award at TAF.[36] It won two awards at the Oslo Films from the South festival in Norway: the main award, the Silver Mirror, and the audience award.[37] It won an Audience Award at 2013 New York International Children\\'s Film Festival[38] and the 2014 Best Anime Disc award from Home Media Magazine.[39]', 'This is an accepted version of this page \\n Ponyo (Japanese: 崖の上のポニョ, Hepburn: Gake no Ue no Ponyo, lit.\\u2009\\'Ponyo on the Cliff\\')[a] is a 2008 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It was animated by Studio Ghibli for the Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Mitsubishi, and distributed by Toho. The film stars Yuria Nara, Hiroki Doi, Tomoko Yamaguchi, Kazushige Nagashima, Yūki Amami, George Tokoro, Rumi Hiiragi, Akiko Yano, Kazuko Yoshiyuki and Tomoko Naraoka. It is the eighth film Miyazaki directed for Studio Ghibli, and his tenth overall.\\n The film tells the story of Ponyo, a goldfish who escapes from the ocean and is helped by a five-year-old human boy, Sōsuke, after she is washed ashore while trapped in a glass jar. As they bond with each other, Ponyo desires to become a human girl, against the devastating circumstances brought about by her acquisition and use of magic.\\n The film was originally released in Japan on July 19, 2008, by distributor Toho. It was a major commercial success, grossing over $204 million worldwide and becoming the eighth-highest-grossing anime film of all time. It received critical acclaim for its uplifting themes, visual design, and simultaneous appeal towards young children and all audiences.\\n An English-language version of the film was released on August 14, 2009, to 927 theatres across the U.S., the widest opening for a Studio Ghibli film in the U.S. It was produced by The Kennedy/Marshall Company and released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through their Walt Disney Pictures banner.\\n Fujimoto, a wizard who was once a human, lives underwater with his daughter Brunhilde and her numerous smaller sisters, who are goldfish-like creatures with human faces. While she and her siblings are on an outing with their father in his four-flippered submarine, Brunhilde sneaks off and floats away on the back of a jellyfish. After an encounter with a fishing trawler, she becomes trapped in a glass jar and drifts to the shore of a small fishing town where she is rescued by a five-year-old boy named Sōsuke. While shattering the jar with a rock, Sōsuke cuts his finger. Brunhilde licks his blood, healing the wound almost instantly. Sōsuke names her Ponyo and promises to protect her. Meanwhile, a distraught Fujimoto searches frantically for his lost daughter whom he believes to have been kidnapped. He calls his wave spirits to recover her, leaving Sōsuke heartbroken and confused by what happened. This causes a major typhoon-like storm across southern Japan.\\n Ponyo refuses to let her father call her by her birth name, declaring her desire to be a human named Ponyo. She magically begins changing into a human, a power granted to her by Sōsuke\\'s human blood that she licked. Fujimoto forces her back into her true form and leaves to summon Ponyo\\'s mother, Gran Mamare. Meanwhile, Ponyo, with the help of her sisters, breaks away from her father and inadvertently uses his magic to make herself human. The huge amount of magic that she releases into the ocean causes an imbalance in nature, resulting in a tsunami. Ponyo goes back to Sōsuke, who is amazed and overjoyed to see her. His mother, Lisa, allows her to stay at their house. Lisa leaves after the tsunami subsides to check up on the residents of the nursing home where she works, promising Sōsuke that she will return home as soon as possible.\\n Gran Mamare arrives at Fujimoto\\'s submarine. Sōsuke\\'s father, Kōichi, sees her traveling and recognizes her as the Goddess of Mercy. Fujimoto notices the moon appears to be falling out of its orbit and satellites are falling like shooting stars, symptoms of the dangerous imbalance of nature that now exists. Gran Mamare reassures him, and declares that if Sōsuke can pass a test, Ponyo can live as a human and the balance of nature will be restored. Fujimoto, still worried, reminds her that if Sōsuke fails the test, Ponyo will turn into sea foam.\\n The next day, Sōsuke and Ponyo find that most of the land around the house has been covered by the ocean. Since it is impossible for Lisa to come home, the two decide to find her. With Ponyo\\'s magic, they make Sōsuke\\'s pop pop boat bigger to traverse the waters, seeing marine life from the Late Devonian period and more people on boats. When they reach the forest, however, Ponyo tires and falls asleep, and the boat slowly reverts back to its original size. Sōsuke drags Ponyo to the shore, where he finds Lisa\\'s abandoned car. As they continue walking, Ponyo mysteriously reverts to her fish form. Meanwhile, Lisa and the residents of the nursing home are temporarily able to breathe water because of Gran Mamare. Ponyo and Sōsuke encounter Fujimoto, who warns the boy about the imbalance of nature, and begs him to return Ponyo to him. Despite their attempt to flee, they are captured, and Fujimoto takes them down to the protected nursing home.\\n Sōsuke reunites with Lisa and meets Gran Mamare, with whom Lisa has just had a long private conversation. Gran Mamare asks him if he can love Ponyo whether she is a fish or human; Sōsuke confirms that he does. She then tells her daughter that if she chooses to become human once and for all, she will have to give up her magical powers. Ponyo agrees, and she is encased in a bubble given to Sōsuke, who is instructed to kiss it to complete Ponyo\\'s transformation, as the balance of nature is restored. The previously stranded ships head back to port. Fujimoto respects his daughter\\'s choice, having decided he can trust Sōsuke. Ponyo then joyfully jumps high in the air and kisses Sōsuke, completing her transformation as a human.\\n Hayao Miyazaki, the film\\'s director and writer, was prompted to create Ponyo after producer Toshio Suzuki suggested he make a film aimed at children, noting the success of Howl\\'s Moving Castle (2004).[7] The film would be created from a mixture of real-world and fictional influences, combined with a desire to implement new art and animation approaches developed by other Studio Ghibli staff in a feature-length film.[8] In 2004 and 2005, Miyazaki spent time in Tomonoura, a seaside town in Setonaikai National Park, where he familiarised himself with its community and environment. His experience in Tomonoura established the kind of setting he wanted for his next film.[9][10] During his time there, he read the complete works of Natsume Sōseki. He took particular interest in The Gate, a book involving a character named Sōsuke who lived at the bottom of a cliff. This provided him more concrete ideas for characters and settings.[11] Initially, Miyazaki solely considered the concept of a film that would depict a stormy sea with \"waves higher than the house on a hillside\". He later created the character Ponyo, a name he thought of as an onomatopoeia of what \"soft, squishy softness\" feels like when touched.[12] Miyazaki recalled that as a nine-year-old he borrowed a copy of Hans Christian Andersen\\'s \"The Little Mermaid\" from his neighbour, and that while he was reading it, he had difficulty accepting its premise that its protagonist did not have a soul.[13]\\n When preparing pre-production materials, Miyazaki hit a creative block before visiting the Tate Britain art museum, where he found himself startled by an 1852 painting named Ophelia done by English painter John Everett Millais and its attention to detail. He remarked, \"I thought, my work is shoddy compared to those artists. I was just astonished. At that point, it became clear to me. Our animation style could not go on as before.\"[14] At the time Katsuya Kondō, Miyazaki\\'s colleague, had been the animation director of House Hunting (2006), a 12-minute short film made for screening at the Ghibli Museum. The short used solid and simple lines, and largely used hand-drawn animation. During the production of the short, Kondō had discussed the possibility of producing a feature-length film like this. Kondō accepted an offer to work on the next Studio Ghibli feature film soon after completing the short, identifying an opportunity to progress the ideas behind House Hunting with more consideration to story.[15]\\n Production of Ponyo began in May 2006. Kondō was given the role of animation supervisor, and worked closely with Miyazaki in outlining a set of goals that defined the direction of the project, including the use of traditional animation throughout production.[8] Borrowing from Kondō\\'s experience in animating House Hunting, Ponyo would use solid and simple lines; in isolating basic animation elements, the film would aim to demonstrate the advantages of hand drawn animation through the depiction of motion that cannot be reproduced in any other medium.[8][15] An example of the simple style is when Miyazaki painted a picture of Ponyo riding on a flock of fish, called \"Ponyo is Here\", which was inspired by him listening to \"Ride of the Valkyries\" while writing a letter to his staff about going with a more elemental style. This would later become a scene in the film.[16] In normal productions, animating a sailing ship would usually involve drawing one cel and sliding it across the frame, which would fix it in a predefined perspective and direction. Miyazaki, however, wanted the ships that appeared in Ponyo to be drawn frame-by-frame.[17] A few previous Studio Ghibli films used computer-generated imagery (CGI), the earliest being Princess Mononoke (1997).[18] For the production of Ponyo however, the computer graphics section at the studio was closed to prioritize hand-drawn animation.[19]\\n Some elements of the film were inspired by Richard Wagner\\'s opera Die Walküre.[20] Ponyo\\'s birth name, Brunhilde, is a deliberate reference to the eldest of the nine legendary Valkyrie and Wagner\\'s Brünnhilde. The music also makes reference to Wagner\\'s opera. The character of Sōsuke is based on Miyazaki\\'s son Gorō Miyazaki when he was five.[21]\\n Miyazaki wanted his next film to be a sequel to Ponyo, but producer Toshio Suzuki convinced him to make The Wind Rises instead.[22]\\n Ponyo\\'s eponymous theme song, \"Gake no Ue no Ponyo\", was released ahead of the film on December 5, 2007, performed by Fujioka Fujimaki (a duo consisting of Takaaki Fujioka and Naoya Fujimaki who are known for their underground band Marichans from the 1970s) and eight-year-old Nozomi Ōhashi.[23] It entered the top 100 on the Oricon Weekly Charts on July 14, then rose to 24th on July 21, then 6th on July 28, and after the release of the film it ranked 3rd on August 4.[24] By the end of 2008, it was ranked as the 14th highest selling single on the Oricon Yearly Charts. Ōhashi was also the youngest participant in the 59th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen, beating Cute\\'s Mai Hagiwara\\'s record at age 11. Afterward, Ōhashi announced her unit with Fujioka Fujimaki was disbanding.[25]\\n An English-translated pop version of the theme was recorded by Jonas and Cyrus to tie in with the film\\'s English release. The theme plays over the second half of the English version\\'s closing credits; the first half is a translated version of the theme rather than a remix.[26]\\n The film score of Ponyo was composed by Joe Hisaishi, Miyazaki\\'s regular collaborator. The score album, published on compact disc in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications,[27] in South Korea by Pony Canyon Korea[28] and throughout Europe by Germany-based label Colosseum,[29] received a great deal of press in the West, including positive reviews from several veteran film music reviewers.[27][30]\\n The film was released by Toho on July 19, 2008, in theatres across Japan on 481 screens—a record for a domestic film.[31][32][33][34] As it had beaten Pokémon: Giratina & the Sky Warrior (which had opened on the same day). It grossed ¥10 billion ($91 million) in its first month of release,[35] and a total of ¥15.0 billion ($153.1 million) as of November 9, 2008.[36][37]\\n Tokyo Anime Fair chose Ponyo as Animation of the Year of 2008, as revealed in a press release by Anime News Network.\\n The film was released on VHS and DVD by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 3, 2009, and on Blu-ray on December 8, 2009.[38] Ponyo was the last Studio Ghibli film and last anime as a whole to be released on VHS, and the first Studio Ghibli film to be released on Blu-ray, although several Ghibli documentaries had been released on the format by Disney Japan prior to the release.[39]\\n Ponyo was released in the U.S. and Canada on August 14, 2009, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through their Walt Disney Pictures banner and The Kennedy/Marshall Company, opening at a wide release at 927 theaters across America, which is by far the widest release for a Studio Ghibli film ever in the U.S, as compared to other Miyazaki films (Spirited Away opened in 26 theaters, Howl\\'s Moving Castle opened in 36 theaters, and Princess Mononoke opened in 38 theaters).[40]\\n The film\\'s English dub was directed by John Lasseter, Brad Lewis and Peter Sohn of Pixar and produced by Frank Marshall, Hayao Miyazaki, John Lasseter, Steve Alpert, and Kathleen Kennedy; the English script was written by Melissa Mathison.[41][42]\\n In July 2009, there were multiple pre-screenings of the film in California. Miyazaki traveled to America to promote this film by speaking at the University of California, Berkeley, and San Diego Comic-Con.[43]\\n Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on March 2, 2010, as the first film produced by Ghibli or directed by either Miyazaki or Takahata to be released on Blu-ray in America.[44][45] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017, under a new deal with Studio Ghibli.[46]\\n Ponyo was released in Southeast Asia on January 1, 2009.[4]\\n The film was re-released from March 25 to 28, 2018, for its 10th anniversary.[47]\\n On its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, it made $3,585,852 on 927 screens, which is a per screen average of $3,868.[2] It also opened at number nine at the United States and Canada box office.[2] The film made a total of $15,743,471 in the United States and Canada and $187,461,411 in other countries for a worldwide total of $203,204,882.[2] It was released on DVD and Blu-ray, as well as a DVD/Plush Toy pack, on March 2, 2010.\\n Ponyo received critical acclaim.[b] Rotten Tomatoes compiled 174 reviews and determined that 91% were positive, with an average score of 7.6/10. The critics consensus on the website states, \"While not Miyazaki\\'s best film, Ponyo is a visually stunning fairy tale that\\'s a sweetly poetic treat for children and Miyazaki fans of all ages.\"[55] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[56]\\n The Japan Times gave the film four out of five stars, praised its simple thematic elements and its visual scheme, and compared the film to Miyazaki\\'s classic animation My Neighbor Totoro.[57]\\n Anime Diet cited the quality of the translation, noting, \"The story and the core of the film was communicated more than adequately through the professional dub and it did not get in the way of the sheer delight and joy that Miyazaki wanted to convey.\" Citing \"slight pacing problems,\" it gave Ponyo a rating of 88%.[58]\\n Critics at the Venice International Film Festival generally had high praise.[59][60] Wendy Ide of The Times said Ponyo \"is as chaotic and exuberant as a story told by a hyperactive toddler,\" and gave it 4 stars out of 5.[61] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, stating that, \"There is a word to describe Ponyo, and that word is magical. This poetic, visually breathtaking work by the greatest of all animators has such deep charm that adults and children will both be touched. It\\'s wonderful and never even seems to try: It unfolds fantastically.\"[62]\\n The film was rated #2 on Dentsu\\'s list of \"2008 Hit Products in Japan\", after the Wii console.[63]\\n Ponyo was an entrant in the 65th Venice International Film Festival.[64] It received a special mention in the Bologna Future Film Festival, for \"the high artistic and expressive quality of animation able to give form to wonderful imagination of the worldwide cinema master\".[65]\\n In 2009, Ponyo won five awards at the 8th annual Tokyo Anime Awards. The awards included \"Anime of the year\" and \"Best domestic feature\". Miyazaki received the award for best director and best original story, and Noboru Yoshida received the award for best art direction.[66]\\n The film won the awards for Animation of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Music at the 32nd Japan Academy Prize.[67]', 'This is an accepted version of this page \\n My Neighbor Totoro (Japanese: となりのトトロ, Hepburn: Tonari no Totoro) is a 1988 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten. It stars the voices of Noriko Hidaka, Chika Sakamoto and Hitoshi Takagi, and focuses on two young sisters and their interactions with friendly wood spirits in postwar rural Japan.\\n The film explores themes such as animism, Shinto symbology, environmentalism and the joys of rural living. My Neighbor Totoro received worldwide critical acclaim, and has grossed over $41 million worldwide at the box office as of September 2019; the film also grossed significantly more from home video sales and merchandise.\\n My Neighbor Totoro received numerous awards, including the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize, the Mainichi Film Award, and Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film in 1988. It also received the Special Award at the Blue Ribbon Awards in the same year. The film is considered as one of the top animation films, ranking 41st in Empire magazine\\'s \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010 and the number-one animated film on the 2012 Sight & Sound critics\\' poll of all-time greatest films.[1][2] The film and its titular character have become cultural icons, and made multiple cameo appearances in other films. Totoro also serves as the mascot for Studio Ghibli and is recognized as one of the most popular characters in Japanese animation.\\n In 1950s Japan, university professor Tatsuo Kusakabe and his daughters Satsuki and Mei (approximately ten and four years old, respectively) move into an old house close to the hospital where the girls\\' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. The house is inhabited by small, dark, dust-like house spirits called susuwatari, that can be seen when moving from bright places to dark ones.[note 1] The susuwatari leave to find another empty house. Mei discovers two small spirits that lead her into the hollow of a large camphor tree. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself using a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". Mei thinks Totoro is the troll from her illustrated book Three Billy Goats Gruff. She falls asleep atop Totoro but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei cannot show her family Totoro\\'s tree. Tatsuo comforts her, saying Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.\\n The girls wait for Tatsuo\\'s bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki\\'s back and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, prompting Satsuki to offer her umbrella to him. Delighted, he gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A giant, bus-shaped cat arrives; Totoro boards it and leaves. A few days after planting the seeds, the girls awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his fellow spirits engaged in a ceremonial dance around the planted seeds. They join in, causing the seeds to grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying top. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have sprouted.\\n The girls discover that a planned visit by their mother has been postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei is upset and argues with Satsuki. She leaves for the hospital to take fresh corn to their mother, but gets lost on the way. Mei\\'s disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her, thinking that Mei has died. In desperation, Satsuki pleads for Totoro\\'s help. Totoro summons the Catbus, which carries Satsuki to Mei\\'s location, and the sisters reunite. The bus then takes them to the hospital, where the girls learn that their mother has been kept in the hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise recovering well. The girls secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where their parents discover it.\\n Eventually, their mother returns home and the girls play with other children while Totoro and his friends watch from afar.\\n Animism is a major theme in My Neighbor Totoro, according to Eriko Ogihara-Schuck.[3] Totoro has animistic traits and has kami status because he lives in a camphor tree in a Shinto shrine surrounded by a Shinto rope, and he is referred to as mori no nushi (master of the forest).[3] Ogihara-Schuck writes that when Mei returns from her encounter with Totoro, her father takes Mei and her sister to the shrine to greet and thank Totoro. This is a common practice in the Shinto tradition following an encounter with a kami.[3] According to Phillip E. Wegner, the film is an example of alternative history, citing the utopian-like setting of the anime.[4]\\n After working on 3000 Miles in Search of a Mother, Miyazaki wanted to make a \"delightful, wonderful film\" that would be set in Japan with the idea to \"entertain and touch its viewers, but stay with them long after they have left the theaters\".[5] Initially, Miyazaki had the main characters Totoro, Mei, Tatsuo, and Kanta.[5]:\\u200a8\\u200a The director based Mei on his niece,[7] and Totoros as \"serene, carefree creatures\" that were \"supposedly the forest keeper, but that\\'s only a half-baked idea, a rough approximation\".[5]:\\u200a5,\\u200a103\\u200a\\n Art director Kazuo Oga was drawn to the film when Hayao Miyazaki showed him an original image of Totoro standing in a satoyama. Miyazaki challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Oga\\'s experience with My Neighbor Totoro began Oga\\'s career. Oga and Miyazaki debated the film\\'s color palette; Oga wanted to paint black soil from Akita Prefecture and Miyazaki preferred the color of red soil from Kantō region.[5]:\\u200a82\\u200a The finished film was described by Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki; \"It was nature painted with translucent colors\".[8]\\n Oga\\'s conscientious approach to My Neighbor Totoro was a style the International Herald Tribune recognized as \"[updating] the traditional Japanese animist sense of a natural world that is fully, spiritually alive\". The newspaper said of the film:\\n Set in a period that is both modern and nostalgic, the film creates a fantastic, yet strangely believable universe of supernatural creatures coexisting with modernity. A great part of this sense comes from Oga\\'s evocative backgrounds, which give each tree, hedge and twist in the road an indefinable feeling of warmth that seems ready to spring into sentient life.[9] Oga\\'s work on My Neighbor Totoro led to his continued involvement with Studio Ghibli, which assigned him jobs that would play to his strengths, and Oga\\'s style became a trademark style of Studio Ghibli.[9]\\n Only one young girl, rather than two sisters, is depicted in several of Miyazaki\\'s initial conceptual watercolor paintings, as well as on the theatrical release poster and on later home-video releases. According to Miyazaki; \"If she was a little girl who plays around in the yard, she wouldn\\'t be meeting her father at a bus stop, so we had to come up with two girls instead. And that was difficult.\"[5]:\\u200a11\\u200a Miyazaki said the film\\'s opening sequence was not storyboarded; \"The sequence was determined through permutations and combinations determined by the time sheets. Each element was made individually and combined in the time sheets\\xa0...\"[5]:\\u200a27\\u200a The ending sequence depicts the mother\\'s return home and the signs of her return to good health by playing with Satsuki and Mei outside.[5]:\\u200a149\\u200a\\n Miyazaki stated that the story was initially intended to be set in 1955, however, the team was not thorough in the research and instead worked on a setting \"in the recent past\".[5]:\\u200a33\\u200a The film was originally set to be an hour long but during production it grew to respond to the social context, including the reason for the move and the father\\'s occupation.[5]:\\u200a54\\u200a Eight animators worked on the film, which was completed in eight months.[10]\\n Tetsuya Endo noted numerous animation techniques were used in the film. For example, ripples were designed with \"two colors of high-lighting and shading\" and the rain for My Neighbor Totoro was \"scratched in the cels\" and superimposed for it to convey a soft feel.[5]:\\u200a156\\u200a The animators stated one month was taken to create the tadpoles, which included four colors; the water for it was also blurred.[5]:\\u200a154\\u200a\\n The music for My Neighbor Totoro was composed by Joe Hisaishi, who previously collaborated with Miyazaki on the movies Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Castle in the Sky. Hisaishi was inspired by the contemporary composers Terry Riley, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and John Cage, and described Miyazaki\\'s films as \"rich and personally compeling\". He hired an orchestra for the soundtrack and primarily used a Fairlight instrument.[5]:\\u200a169,\\u200a170\\u200a\\n \\nThe soundtrack for My Neighbor Totoro was first released in Japan on May 1, 1988, by Tokuma Shoten, and includes the musical score used in the film, except for five vocal pieces that were performed by Azumi Inoue, including \"Stroll\", \"A Lost Child\", and \"My Neighbor Totoro\".[11] It had previously been released as an Image Song CD in 1987 that contains some songs that were not included in the film.[12]  After writing and filming Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984) and Castle in the Sky (1986), Hayao Miyazaki began directing My Neighbor Totoro for Studio Ghibli. Miyazaki\\'s production paralleled his colleague Isao Takahata\\'s production of Grave of the Fireflies. Miyazaki\\'s film was financed by executive producer Yasuyoshi Tokuma, and both My Neighbor Totoro and Grave of the Fireflies were released on the same bill in 1988. The dual billing was considered \"one of the most moving and remarkable double bills ever offered to a cinema audience\".[14]\\n In Japan, My Neighbor Totoro initially sold 801,680 tickets and earned a distribution rental income of ¥588 million in 1988. According to the animation scholar Seiji Kano, by 2005, the film\\'s box-office gross receipts in Japan totalled ¥1.17 billion[15] ($10.6 million).[16] In France, the film has sold 429,822 tickets since 1999.[17] The film has been internationally released several times since 2002.[18] The film has grossed $30,476,708 worldwide since 2002.[19] A South China Morning Post article in 2021 reported that the film has grossed more than $41 million in total.[20]\\n Thirty years after its original release in Japan, My Neighbor Totoro received a Chinese theatrical release in December 2018. The delay was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan but many Chinese people had become familiar with Miyazaki\\'s films due to rampant video piracy.[21] In its opening weekend, ending December 16, 2018, My Neighbor Totoro grossed $13 million, entering the box-office charts at number two behind Hollywood film Aquaman and ahead of Bollywood film Padman at number three.[22] By its second weekend, My Neighbor Totoro had grossed $20 million in China.[23] As of February 2019, it had grossed $25,798,550 in China.[24]\\n In 1989, US-based company Streamline Pictures produced an exclusive English language dub of My Neighbor Totoro for use as an in-flight movie on Japan Airlines flights.[25] In April 1993, Troma Films, under its label 50th St. Films, distributed the dub of the film as a theatrical release.[26] The songs for the Streamline version of My Neighbor Totoro were sung by Cassie Byram.[27]\\n In 2004, Walt Disney Pictures produced a new English dub of My Neighbor Totoro to be released after the rights to the Streamline dub had expired. As is the case with Disney\\'s other English dubs of Miyazaki films, the Disney version of My Neighbor Totoro has a star-heavy cast, including Dakota and Elle Fanning as Satsuki and Mei, Timothy Daly as Mr. Kusakabe, Pat Carroll as Granny, Lea Salonga as Mrs. Kusakabe, and Frank Welker as Totoro and Catbus. The songs for the new dub retain the translation as the earlier dub but are sung by Sonya Isaacs.[28] The Disney dub was directed by Rick Dempsey, a Disney executive in charge of the company\\'s dubbing services,[29] and was written by Don and Cindy Hewitt, who had written other dubs for Studio Ghibli.[30]\\n Disney\\'s English-language dub premiered on October 23, 2005; it was screened at the 2005 Hollywood Film Festival.[29][31] The cable television network Turner Classic Movies (TCM) held the television premiere of Disney\\'s new English dub in January 2006, as part of the network\\'s tribute to Hayao Miyazaki. TCM aired the dub and the original Japanese film with English subtitles.[32] The Disney version was released on DVD in the United States on March 7, 2006.[33] In Australia, an English dub was also released by Madman Entertainment on March 15, 2006.[34]\\n In 2023, the film was re-released in 970 United States locations as part of celebrations to mark the 35th anniversary of its first theatrical release,[35] with showings in both Japanese with English subtitles and with the English dub.[36][37]\\n Tokuma Shoten released My Neighbor Totoro on VHS and LaserDisc in August 1988.[38] Buena Vista Home Entertainment Japan (now Walt Disney Japan) reissued the VHS on June 27, 1997, as part of their series Ghibli ga Ippai.[39] Disney released the film on Blu-ray in Japan on 2012.[40]\\n After the rights to the Streamline dub expired in 2004,[41] Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released the movie on DVD on March 7, 2006, with Disney\\'s newly produced English dub and the original Japanese version. The company reissued My Neighbor Totoro, as well as Castle in the Sky, and Kiki\\'s Delivery Service, with updated cover art highlighting its Studio Ghibli origins, on March 2, 2010, coinciding with the US DVD and Blu-ray debut of Ponyo. My Neighbor Totoro was re-released by Disney on Blu-Ray on May 21, 2013. GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[42]\\n In Japan, My Neighbor Totoro had sold 3.5\\xa0million VHS and DVD units as of April 2012,[43] equivalent to approximately ¥16,100 million ($202 million) at an average retail price of ¥4,600 (¥4,700 on DVD and ¥4,500 on VHS).[44] In the United States, the film sold over 500,000 VHS units by 1996,[45] with the later 2010 DVD release selling a further 3.8\\xa0million units and grossing $64.5 million in the United States as of October 2018.[46]\\n In the UK, the film\\'s Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared on the annual lists of ten-best-selling foreign language films on home video for five consecutive years, ranking number seven in 2015,[47] number six in 2016[48] and 2017,[49] number one in 2018,[50] and number two in 2019 below Spirited Away.[51]\\n My Neighbor Totoro received widespread acclaim from film critics.[52][53] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 59 critics\\' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website\\'s consensus reads: \"My Neighbor Totoro is a heartwarming, sentimental masterpiece that captures the simple grace of childhood.\"[54] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 86 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[55]\\n In 2001, Japanese magazine Animage ranked My Neighbor Totoro 45th in its list of 100 Best Anime Productions of All Time.[56] My Neighbor Totoro was voted the highest-ranking animated film on Sight & Sound\\'s critics\\' poll of all-time greatest films, and joint 154th overall.[1] In 2022, the magazine ranked the film as the joint-72nd-greatest film overall, being one of two animated films included in the list.[57][58] My Neighbor Totoro was ranked third on the list of \"Greatest Japanese Animated Films of All Time\" by film magazine Kinema Junpo in 2009, 41st in Empire magazine\\'s \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010, second on a similar Empire list of best children\\'s films, and number one in the greatest animated films in Time Out; a similar list by the editors ranked the film in third place.[2][59][60][61]\\n \\nFilm critic Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times identified My Neighbor Totoro as one of his \"Great Movies\", calling it \"one of the lovingly hand-crafted works of Hayao Miyazaki\". In his review, Ebert said the film \"is based on experience, situation and exploration—not on conflict and threat\", and added: \\nit would never have won its worldwide audience just because of its warm heart. It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls\\xa0... It is a little sad, a little scary, a little surprising and a little informative, just like life itself. It depends on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need.[62] Steve Rose from The Guardian gave the film five stars, praising Miyazaki\\'s \"rich, bright, hand-drawn\" animation and describing it as \"full of benign spirituality, prelapsarian innocence and joyous discovery, all rooted in a carefully detailed reality\".[63] Trevor Johnston from Time Out also awarded the film five stars, commenting on its \"delicate rendering of the atmosphere\" and its first half that \"delicately captures both mystery and quietness\".[64] Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited My Neighbor Totoro as one of his favorite films.[65] Writing for the London Evening Standard, Charlotte O\\'Sullivan praised the charm of the film but said it lacks complexity in comparison with Spirited Away.[66] Jordan Cronk from Slant awarded the film three-and-a-half stars but said it is \"devoid of much of the fantasia of Miyazaki\\'s more outwardly visionary work\".[67] In the 1996 movie guide \"Seen That, Now What?\", My Neighbor Totoro was given the rating of \"A\". The guide stated that the film is an \"enchanting, lushly animated view of the natural world with child\\'s sense of wonder\", and noting its suitability for young children while being \"a perennial favorite among [film buffs]\".[68]\\n The 1993 translation was not as well-received as the 2006 translation; Leonard Klady of Variety wrote the 1993 translation demonstrates \"adequate television technical craft\" that is characterized by \"muted pastels, homogenized pictorial style and [a] vapid storyline\". Klady described the film\\'s environment as \"obviously aimed at an international audience\" but \"evinces a disorienting combination of cultures that produces a nowhere land more confused than fascinating\".[69] Stephen Holden of The New York Times described the 1993 translation as \"very visually handsome\", and said the film is \"very charming\" when \"dispensing enchantment\". Despite the highlights, Holden wrote \"too much of the film, however, is taken up with stiff, mechanical chitchat\".[70]\\n Matthew Leyland of Sight & Sound reviewed the DVD released in 2006, commenting; \"Miyazaki\\'s family fable is remarkably light on tension, conflict and plot twists, yet it beguiles from beginning to end\\xa0... what sticks with the viewer is the every-kid credibility of the girls\\' actions as they work, play and settle into their new surroundings\". Leyland praised the DVD transfer of the film but noted the disc lacks a look at the film\\'s production, instead being overabundant with storyboards.[71] Writing in Joe Hisaishi\\'s Soundtrack for My Neighbor Totoro, Kunio Hara praised the soundtrack, describing the song \"My Neighbor Totoro\" as a \"sonic icon\" of the film. Hara also commented the music \"arouse[s] a similar sentiment of yearning for the past\".[38]\\n My Neighbor Totoro was considered a milestone for writer-director Hayao Miyazaki. The popularity of the film\\'s central character Totoro among Japanese children has been likened to that of Winnie-the-Pooh in Britain.[76] The Independent said Totoro is one of the greatest cartoon characters, describing the creature; \"At once innocent and awe-inspiring, King Totoro captures the innocence and magic of childhood more than any of Miyazaki\\'s other magical creations\".[77] The Financial Times recognized the character\\'s appeal, commenting Totoro \"is more genuinely loved than Mickey Mouse could hope to be in his wildest—not nearly so beautifully illustrated—fantasies\".[76] Empire also commented on Totoro\\'s appeal, ranking him at number 18 on a list of the greatest animated characters of all time.[78]\\n The character of Totoro later became a mascot and official logo for Studio Ghibli.[79][80][81][82]\\n According to the environmental journal Ambio, My Neighbor Totoro \"has served as a powerful force to focus the positive feelings that the Japanese people have for satoyama and traditional village life\". The film\\'s central character Totoro was used as a mascot by the Japanese campaign \"Totoro Hometown Fund Campaign\", which aimed to preserve areas of satoyama in Saitama Prefecture.[83] The fund, started in 1990 after the film\\'s release, held an auction in August 2008 at Pixar Animation Studios to sell over 210 original paintings, illustrations, and sculptures inspired by My Neighbor Totoro.[84]\\n Miyazaki additionally uses Totoro as a part of his logo for Studio Ghibli.[85] Totoro also makes a cameo appearance in the Pixar film Toy Story 3 (2010)[86] but was not included in Toy Story 4 due to licensing problems.[87] Toy Story 3\\'s art director Daisuke Tsutsumi is married to Miyazaki\\'s niece, who inspired the character Mei in My Neighbor Totoro.[7]\\n A main-belt asteroid that was discovered on December 31, 1994, was named 10160 Totoro.[88] In 2013, Eoperipatus totoro, a species of velvet worm that was discovered in Vietnam, was named after Totoro. Following the request of the paper\\'s authors, the species was named for the character because he \"uses a many-legged animal as a vehicle, which according to the collectors resembles a velvet worm\".[89]\\n In Japan in May 1988, Tokuma published a four-volume series of ani-manga books, which use color images and lines directly from My Neighbor Totoro.[90][91] The series was licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which released the books from November 10, 2004, through February 15, 2005.[92][93][94][95] A 111-page picture book based on the film and aimed at young children was released by Tokuma on June 28, 1988, and, in a 112-page English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005.[96][97] Tokuma later released another 176-page art book containing conceptual art from the film and interviews with production staff on July 15, 1988, and, in English translation, by Viz on November 8, 2005.[98][99] In 2013, Viz released a hardcover light novel that was written by Tsugiko Kubo and illustrated by Hayao Miyazaki.[100]\\n Mei and the Kittenbus (めいとこねこバス, Mei to Konekobasu) is a thirteen-minute sequel to My Neighbor Totoro that was written and directed by Miyazaki.[101] Chika Sakamoto, who voiced Mei in Totoro, returned to voice Mei in this short. Hayao Miyazaki voiced Granny Cat (Neko Baa-chan) and Totoro. The sequel focuses on the character Mei Kusakabe from the original film and her one-night adventures with Kittenbus, the offspring of Catbus, and other cat-oriented vehicles.[102] The sequel was first released in Japan in 2003 and is regularly shown at Ghibli Museum[103] but has not been released on home video.\\n Licensed My Neighbor Totoro merchandise of Totoro has been sold in Japan for decades after the film\\'s release. Sales of the film\\'s licensed merchandise in Japan grossed ¥10.97 billion in 1999, ¥56.08 billion during 2003–2007,[104] at least ¥4.1 billion in 2008,[105] and ¥19.96 billion during 2010–2012.[104]\\n In May 2022, the Royal Shakespeare Company and composer Joe Hisaishi announced that a stage adaptation of the film titled My Neighbor Totoro would run from 8 October 2022 to 21 January 2023 at the Barbican Centre in London.[106] It was adapted by British playwright Tom Morton-Smith and directed by Improbable\\'s Phelim McDermott.[107] Tickets went on sale on 19 May 2022, breaking the theater\\'s box-office record for sales in one day which was previously held by the 2015 production of Hamlet starring Benedict Cumberbatch.[108] The show won six Olivier Awards.[109]\\n On 30 March 2023, it was announced that the production will return to the Barbican for another season,[110] which began on 21 November 2023 and ran until 23 March 2024.[109][needs update]', 'Kiki\\'s Delivery Service (Japanese: 魔女の宅急便, Hepburn: Majo no Takkyūbin, lit.\\u2009\\'Witch\\'s Express Home Delivery\\') is a 1989 Japanese animated fantasy film written, produced, and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, based on the 1985 novel of the same name by Eiko Kadono. It was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Yamato Transport and the Nippon Television Network, and stars the voices of Minami Takayama, Rei Sakuma and Kappei Yamaguchi. The story follows Kiki, a young witch who moves to the port city of Koriko with her cat Jiji and starts a flying courier service.\\n In 1987, Group Fudosha asked Kadono\\'s publishers for the rights to the novel to be made into a film by either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. Production began near the release of My Neighbor Totoro (1988). Miyazaki initially worked as producer, but took over directing from Sunao Katabuchi as he became more involved in the project. As the novel is based on a fictional northern European country, Miyazaki and his team traveled to locations such as Visby, Sweden, to research its landscape. Miyazaki altered the story, adding new scenes to emphasize the theme of independence and growing up. According to Miyazaki, the film portrays the gulf between independence and reliance among teenage Japanese girls.[1]\\n Kiki\\'s Delivery Service was released in Japan on July 29, 1989, by the Toei Company.[2] It was the first Studio Ghibli film to be successful on initial release, grossing a total of ¥4.3 billion ($31 million). It received critical acclaim and multiple awards.\\n An English dub was produced by Streamline Pictures for Japan Airlines international flights in 1989. Walt Disney Pictures produced an English dub in 1997, which became the first film under a deal between Tokuma and Disney to be released in English. It was released to home media in 1998.\\n Kiki, a young witch, decides to go out on her own, which all young witches must do, taking her talking black cat, Jiji, with her. Her mother insists that she take her mother’s old, reliable broomstick. Kiki flies off into the night, searching for a new town to settle into. She encounters another witch and her cat who she finds pretentious but they cause Kiki to wonder what her special \"skill\" is. Kiki finds the town of Koriko and accidentally flies through traffic, causing disruptions. She is approached by a policeman, but a boy named Tombo helps her escape.\\n Kiki looks for a place to live and work in her new town. She finds the Gutiokipanja bakery, owned by Osono and her husband, Fukuo, who are expecting a child. Osono invites her to live in a room above the bakery. Kiki opens a business delivering goods by broomstick, known as the \"Witch Delivery Service\". Her first delivery is of a small stuffed toy of a black cat that looks like Jiji. Along the way, she is caught in the wind and ends up in a forest filled with crows, which attack her, causing her to lose the toy. They come up with a plan in which Jiji pretends to be the toy until Kiki can retrieve the real one. She finds it in the home of a young painter, Ursula, who repairs and returns it. With the help of a dog, Kiki successfully retrieves Jiji and replaces him with the stuffed cat.\\n The next day, Tombo gives her an invitation to visit his aviation club. However, she gets busy with her deliveries, and gets caught in a thunderstorm on her way back. Drenched from the rain, she decides not to go. She then falls ill, but Osono cares for her until she recovers. Osono secretly arranges for Kiki to see Tombo again by assigning her a delivery addressed to him. Kiki apologizes for missing the party, and Tombo takes her for a test ride on the flying machine he is working on, fashioned from a bicycle. Kiki warms up to him, but is once again disgusted by Tombo\\'s friends.\\n Kiki becomes depressed and discovers she can no longer understand Jiji. She has also lost her flying ability and is forced to suspend her delivery business. Ursula then visits Kiki and asks if she can go to her house. She agrees, and the two spend time together there. Ursula determines that Kiki\\'s crisis is a form of artist\\'s block, and then suggests to her to find a new purpose, so that she can regain her powers.\\n While visiting a former customer\\'s house she witnesses an airship accident on television. Tombo is seen trying to help tie the dirigible to the ground, but a gust of wind pushes the aircraft away with him clinging to the rope. Kiki rushes to the scene and asks to borrow a broom from a local shop-owner. She regains her flying power and manages to rescue Tombo. With her confidence restored, she resumes her delivery service, and writes a letter home saying that she and Jiji are happy.\\n A major theme of the film is maturity.[6] After leaving her parents who are supportive of her independence, Kiki has to face problems common to adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself.[7] The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling notes a scene during Kiki\\'s first night away from home where Kiki rushes back to her room and slams the door behind her to avoid being spotted by Fukuo. Fukuo, however, steps outside simply to stretch his arms, and Kiki\\'s bizarrely shy behavior \"expresses [her] youth, vulnerability, and isolation.\"[8][9]\\n Another theme is the transition from traditional to contemporary. Kiki is shown to balance both of these qualities. For instance, Kiki observes the tradition of witches wearing dark-colored clothes, but adorns her hair with a bright red bow.[10][page\\xa0needed] Kiki also engages in other traditional methods, such as baking with a wood-burning stove and flying her mother\\'s old broom.[10][page\\xa0needed]\\n Kiki\\'s loss of her witch powers is considered the worst crisis she has to face during the film.[11][12] Her loss of flight reflects the harm dealt to Kiki by her own self-doubts.[11][13] This hardship causes Kiki to realize that being vulnerable does not always lead to failure and can help her learn valuable lessons to better understand herself.[13] Petrana Radulovic also suggests that Jiji\\'s bond with Kiki represents the experiences she had as a child, and that once Kiki loses her powers to talk to Jiji, she becomes more lonely.[14] Jiji had served as the wiser voice (imaginary companion) to Kiki, and she stopped being able to understand him the moment she struggles with self-doubt. According to Miyazaki himself, Jiji is meant to represent the immature side of Kiki, and her inability to talk to Jiji represents her newfound maturity at the end of the movie.[15]\\n In relation to Kiki\\'s portrayal as a witch, some have drawn comparisons to historical or contemporary views on witches and witchcraft. The film incorporates some conventions from fairy-tales such as a black cat companion for Kiki,[16] Kiki\\'s use of a broom for flight, and her black dress.[17] While girls with magical powers are common in Japanese television, Miyazaki wanted to stray away from the various stereotypes generated from these shows, remarking that witchcraft \"has always merely been the means to fulfill the dreams of young girls.\"[18] This stereotypical portrayal of witches is also shown in the older witch Kiki encounters while travelling to Koriko.[18]\\n Kiki has also been compared to other characters in Miyazaki\\'s films. While there are overt differences in demeanor between Kiki and San from Princess Mononoke, a character who is motivated by anger, both characters take control over their own lives. This theme of remarkable independence is also seen in Miyazaki\\'s earlier works, such as in Nausicaä in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.[19] Kiki is also compared to Chihiro of Spirited Away as they are both young girls attempting to seek independence without being rebellious. Both Chihiro and Kiki develop their independence with the help of their friends.[20]\\n In 1987, Group Fudosha asked Kadono\\'s publishers for the rights to adapt Kadono\\'s novel into a feature film directed by either Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata of Studio Ghibli. However, both of the chosen directors were busy, working on My Neighbor Totoro and Grave of the Fireflies respectively.[22] Miyazaki accepted the role of producer while the studio continued to search for a director.[23] Near the end of Totoro\\'s production, members of Studio Ghibli were being recruited as senior staff for Kiki\\'s Delivery Service. The character design position was given to Katsuya Kondo, who was working with Miyazaki on Totoro. Hiroshi Ohno, who would later work on projects such as Jin-Roh, was hired as art director at the request of Kazuo Oga.\\n Miyazaki chose Sunao Katabuchi as director. Katabuchi had worked with Miyazaki on Sherlock Hound; Kiki\\'s Delivery Service was to have been his directorial debut. Studio Ghibli hired Nobuyuki Isshiki as script writer, but Miyazaki was dissatisfied by the first draft, finding it dry and too divergent from his own vision of the film.[24] Although the novel is set in a fictional northern European country, Miyazaki did not originally travel to Sweden for research. Instead, he had previously visited locations such as Visby and Stockholm while attempting to secure the rights for an animated adaptation of Pippi Longstocking. After being denied a meeting with Astrid Lindgren, he later used reference photos from that trip as inspiration for the film’s setting.[25][26][27] The architecture of Koriko is also based on the design of buildings from other cities such as Amsterdam, Paris, and San Francisco.[28]\\n Upon their return to Japan, Miyazaki and the creative team worked on conceptual art and character designs. Miyazaki began significantly modifying the story, creating new ideas and changing existing ones.[29] Majo no Takkyūbin, the original children\\'s book by Kadono that the movie was based on, is very different from Miyazaki\\'s finished film. Kadono\\'s novel is more episodic, consisting of small stories about various people and incidents Kiki encounters while making deliveries. Kiki overcomes many challenges in the novel based on \"her good heart\" and consequently expands her circle of friends. She faces no particular traumas or crises.[30] Many of the more dramatic elements, such as Kiki getting attacked by many crows, losing her powers or the airship incident at the film\\'s climax, are not present in the original story. In order to more clearly illustrate the themes of struggling with independence and growing up in the film, Miyazaki intended to have Kiki face tougher challenges and create a more potent sense of loneliness.[30] One such challenge is Kiki\\'s sudden loss of ability to fly. This event is only loosely paralleled in the novel, in which Kiki\\'s broom breaks and merely requires her to fix it.[8] Miyazaki remarked, \"As movies always create a more realistic feeling, Kiki will suffer stronger setbacks and loneliness than in the original\".[8] Kadono was unhappy with the changes made between the book and film, to the point that the project was in danger of being shelved at the screenplay stage.[31] Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki, the producer of Ghibli, went to the author\\'s home and invited her to the film\\'s studio. After her visit to the studio, Kadono decided to let the project continue.[23]\\n Miyazaki finished the rough draft of the screenplay in June 1988 and presented it in July 1988. It was at this time that Miyazaki revealed that he had decided to direct the film, because he had influenced the project so much.[29] Kiki\\'s Delivery Service was originally intended to be a 60-minute special, but expanded into a feature film running 102 minutes after Miyazaki completed storyboarding and scripting it.[32]\\n The word takkyūbin (宅急便, literally \"home-fast-mail\") in the Japanese title is a trademark of Yamato Transport (which stylized it in non-Japanese languages as TA-Q-BIN), though it is used today as a synonym for takuhaibin (宅配便, \"home-delivery-mail\"). While Yamato Transport sponsored the film, it initially did not approve of the usage of its trademark, since it was used by Kadano without permission. However, the success of the film restored relations between both her and Yamato Transport.[18][23]\\n The film had a production budget of ¥800 million ($6.9 million), making it one of the most expensive anime films up until then, along with Akira (1988)[33] and Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise (1987).[34]\\n As with Hayao Miyazaki\\'s other films, Joe Hisaishi composed the soundtrack for this film. Three months before the theatrical release of the movie, the image album for the film was published by Tokuma Shoten on Compact disc. A vocal album was released in November 1992.[35]\\n For the 1997 Disney English dub, much of the soundtrack was retained except for \"Message of Rouge\" and \"Wrapped in Kindness\", which were the opening and ending themes of the original Japanese version. Instead, they were replaced with two songs by Sydney Forest; \"Soaring\" and \"I\\'m Gonna Fly\". Both these songs were removed from the 2010 DVD re-release of the English dub of Kiki\\'s Delivery Service.[36] Paul Chihara composed the music for the dub, adding music to scenes that were silent in the original Japanese version.[37]\\n Kiki\\'s Delivery Service premiered on July 29, 1989, in Japanese theaters. It sold around 2,640,000 tickets in Japan,[38][39] with a total box office of ¥4.3 billion (US$31 million) in gross receipts.[40] It became the first Studio Ghibli film to be successful during its initial release and was one of 1989\\'s highest-grossing films in Japan.[38][41] It also grossed HK$4.04 million (US$519,000) in Hong Kong upon release there in 1990.[3] Later re-releases and international releases between 2004 and 2023 grossed US$10,366,082 worldwide,[42] adding up to $41,885,082 grossed worldwide as of 2023[update].[note 1] In the United Kingdom, it was 2018\\'s seventh best-selling foreign-language film on home video,[43] and 2019\\'s fifth best-selling foreign-language film (below four other Japanese films, including three Miyazaki anime films).[44]\\n Streamline Pictures produced the first official English dub of Kiki\\'s Delivery Service in November 1989 for Japan Airlines international flights. It was the second Studio Ghibli dub produced by Streamline following My Neighbor Totoro earlier that year. Tokuma Shoten commissioned Streamline for the Kiki\\'s Delivery Service dub after being satisfied with the English production of My Neighbor Totoro, but did not give Streamline the rights to distribute the film in North America.[45] The Streamline dub was released only on the Ghibli LaserDisc Box Set in 1996, which is out of print.[23]\\n Disney produced an English dub in 1997[37] and Kiki was the first film released through a deal Disney made with Tokuma.[39] It premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 23, 1998, and was released on both VHS and LaserDisc by Buena Vista Home Video in September 1998.[3][36] It became the eighth-most sold film on Blockbuster during its first week of availability,[46] and sold over 900,000 copies by September 28, 1998.[47] It was released on home media in North America in 2003, alongside the releases of Spirited Away and Castle in the Sky.[48] Disney re-released the film to DVD in 2010 with an updated English dub that removed the earlier dub\\'s deviations from the Japanese version.[49][23]\\n In the United Kingdom, the film was released on Blu-ray by StudioCanal alongside a release of Grave of the Fireflies on July 1, 2013,[50] while in North America, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray Disc alongside Princess Mononoke and The Wind Rises, on November 18, 2014.[51] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[52] In 2020, it was announced the Japanese version and the Disney dub would be streaming on Netflix.[53]\\n At the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 98% of 43 reviews are positive for Kiki\\'s Delivery Service, and the average rating is 8.1/10. The critics consensus reads, \"Kiki\\'s Delivery Service is a heartwarming, gorgeously-rendered tale of a young witch discovering her place in the world.\"[54] Metacritic, another aggregator, collected 15 reviews and calculated an average rating of 85 out of 100, signifying \"universal acclaim\".[55]\\n Initial reviews and reception for Kiki\\'s Delivery Service were positive. Mark Schilling of The Japan Times gave a positive review, praising the realism of Kiki\\'s character, as well as citing various scenes that emphasized it,[9] and Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa also showed admiration for the film.[56] The film also received similar acclaim in America once it was released there. On September 12, 1998, it was the first video release to be reviewed as a normal film on Siskel and Ebert rather than on the \"Video Pick of the Week\" section.[46] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it \"two thumbs up\"[57][58]\\n Retrospective reviews were also positive. IGN\\'s Andy Patrizio praised the film for its simple but meaningful story, as well as the voice acting of the English dub,[59] while Vox\\'s Allegra Frank felt that the film presented its message well.[60]\\n The film was also ranked high in various publications. Entertainment Weekly rated it as Video of the Year in 1998,[61] and in the same year Roger Ebert went on to rank it as one of the best animated films released in the U.S.[62] The film also ranked No. 12 on Wizard\\'s Anime Magazine\\'s list of the \"Top 50 Anime released in North America\".[63]\\n A four-volume ani-manga book series using stills from the film was published in Japan by Tokuma Shoten between August and September 1989.[69][70] An English translation would later be published by Viz Media between April and July 2006.[71][72][73][74] Tokuma also published a 208-page art book on February 11, 1989, and Viz Media published the English translation of it on May 9, 2006.[75][76]\\n A musical based on the film ran at the Southwark Playhouse in the UK from December 8, 2016, to January 7, 2017, and officially opened on December 13, 2016. It was adapted by Jessica Sian and directed by Katie Hewitt.[77] The musical would later run again from August 10, 2017, to September 3, 2017.[78]\\n There were also other musicals that ran in Japan. The first ran in Tokyo and Osaka from June 2017 to September 2017, and starred Moka Kamishirasi as Kiki and Aran Abe as Tombo. A second one ran in 2018 which starred Riko Fukumoto as Kiki. The most recent one ran from March 2021 to April 2021 in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka. It stars Neo Inoue as Kiki, and Yūto Nasu as Tombo.[79]', 'Spirited Away (Japanese: 千と千尋の神隠し, Hepburn: Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, lit.\\u2009\\'Sen and Chihiro\\'s Spiriting Away\\') is a 2001 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Spirited Away tells the story of Chihiro \"Sen\" Ogino, a ten-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighborhood, inadvertently enters the world of kami (spirits of Japanese Shinto folklore).[7] After her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba\\'s bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and return to the human world. The film was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Tohokushinsha Film, and Mitsubishi and distributed by Toho.[8]\\n Miyazaki wrote the screenplay after he decided the film would be based on the ten-year-old daughter of his friend Seiji Okuda, the film\\'s associate producer, who came to visit his house each summer.[9] At the time, Miyazaki was developing two personal projects, but they were rejected. With a budget of US$19 million, production of Spirited Away began in 2000. Pixar animator John Lasseter, a fan and friend of Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film\\'s North American distribution rights, and served as executive producer of its English-dubbed version.[10] Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as director and Donald W. Ernst as producer, while screenwriters Cindy and Donald Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue to match the characters\\' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\\n Released in Japan on 20 July 2001, Spirited Away was widely acclaimed and commercially successful,[12] grossing $395.8 million at the worldwide box office.[a][13] Accordingly, it became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a total of ¥31.68 billion ($305 million).[14] It held the record for 19 years until it was surpassed by Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Mugen Train in 2020.[15]\\n Spirited Away was a co-recipient of the Golden Bear with Bloody Sunday at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival and became the first hand-drawn, Japanese anime and non-English-language animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards.[16] The film is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been included in various \"best-of\" lists, including ranking fourth on BBC\\'s 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century.\\n Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home. Chihiro\\'s father decides to take a shortcut. He stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, which her mother insists on exploring over Chihiro\\'s protestations. Upon finding a seemingly empty restaurant still stocked with food, Chihiro\\'s parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro finds an enormous bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers her parents have been transformed into pigs and she cannot cross the now-flooded river.\\n Haku finds Chihiro and instructs her to ask for a job from the bathhouse\\'s boiler-man, Kamaji, a yōkai commanding the susuwatari. Kamaji instead asks a worker named Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse and cursed her parents, as well as Haku\\'s master. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but eventually gives her a work contract. As Chihiro signs the contract with her name (千尋), Yubaba takes away the second kanji in her name, renaming her Sen (千). She soon forgets her real name, and Haku later explains that Yubaba controls people by taking their names; if she completely forgets hers like he once did, she will never be able to leave the spirit world.\\n The other workers, except for Kamaji and Lin, frequently mock Sen. While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face inside, believing him to be a customer. The spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen\\'s first customer. After she cleans him, he gives her a magic emetic dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face demands food from the bathhouse workers, granting gold copied from the river spirit in exchange. However, when Sen declines the gold and leaves, he angrily swallows some workers.\\n Sen sees paper shikigami attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When the seriously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba\\'s penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back shapeshifts into Yubaba\\'s twin sister Zeniba, who turns Yubaba\\'s son, Boh, into a mouse and creates a false copy of him. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her that carries a deadly curse. Haku strikes the shikigami, causing Zeniba to vanish. Once he and Sen fall into the boiler room, she gives him part of the emetic dumpling to vomit up the seal and a slug that Sen disgustedly kills.\\n Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. She confronts an engorged No-Face and feeds him the rest of the dumpling to regurgitate the workers. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, and Lin helps them leave. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba with train tickets gifted by Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba nearly orders Sen\\'s parents\\' slaughtering, but Haku reveals Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba complies, but only if Sen can pass a final test.\\n Sen meets with Zeniba, who makes her a magic hairband and reveals that Yubaba used the slug to control Haku. Using his dragon form, Haku flies Sen and Boh back, while No-Face decides to stay with Zeniba. Mid-flight, Sen recalls falling into the Kohaku River years earlier and being washed safely ashore, correctly guessing Haku\\'s real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River (ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ, Nigihayami Kohakunushi). \\n When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba tests Sen to identify her parents among a group of pigs to leave. After she answers correctly that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract disappears and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents. Shortly before leaving for her new home, Chihiro looks back at the tunnel with her hairband from Zeniba still intact.\\n \"I created a heroine who is an ordinary girl, someone with whom the audience can sympathize [...]. [I]t\\'s not a story in which the characters grow up, but a story in which they draw on something already inside them, brought out by the particular circumstances [...]. I want my young friends to live like that, and I think they, too, have such a wish.\"\\n —Hayao Miyazaki[17] During summers, Hayao Miyazaki spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for Spirited Away came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki\\'s Delivery Service, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read the shōjo manga magazines (like Nakayoshi and Ribon) that the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on \"crushes\" and romance. Miyazaki felt this was not what these young friends \"held dear in their hearts\", and resolved to make the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to.[17]\\n Miyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years, but his two previous proposals—one based on the Japanese book Kiri no Mukō no Fushigi na Machi (霧のむこうのふしぎな町) by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and another about a teenage heroine—were rejected. His third proposal, which ended up becoming Spirited Away, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki\\'s hometown. He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house. Miyazaki was always curious about what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of Spirited Away.[17]\\n Production of Spirited Away commenced in February 2000 on a budget of ¥1.9 billion (US$15 million).[2] Walt Disney Pictures financed ten percent of the film\\'s production cost for the right of first refusal for American distribution.[18][19] As with Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage 3D, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of \"stealing the show\". Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see if they were getting it just right.[2] The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production began, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the \"eye candy\" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a \"pretty girl\". At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked \"dull\" and thought, \"She isn\\'t cute. Isn\\'t there something we can do?\" As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel \"she will be a charming woman.\"[17]\\n During production, Miyazaki often sought inspiration by visiting the Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo. He based some of the buildings in the spirit world on the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, \"especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, and the sun is setting\\xa0– tears well up in my eyes.\"[17] Another major inspiration was the Notoya Ryokan (能登谷旅館), a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features.[20] While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this.[21] The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the Spirited Away onsen/bathhouse.[22]\\n Toshio Suzuki, the producer of the film, also cites European inspirations and influences in the production of Spirited Away. He specifically invokes the structure of the film as European-inspired due to Miyazaki\\'s own influences by European films such as The Snow Queen and The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep.[23]\\n The film score of Spirited Away was composed and conducted by Miyazaki\\'s regular collaborator Joe Hisaishi, and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic.[24] The soundtrack received awards at the 56th Mainichi Film Competition Award for Best Music, the Tokyo International Anime Fair 2001 Best Music Award in the Theater Movie category, and the 17th Japan Gold Disk Award for Animation Album of the Year.[25][26][27] Later, Hisaishi added lyrics to \"One Summer\\'s Day\" and named the new version of the song \"The Name of Life\" (いのちの名前, \"Inochi no Namae\") which was performed by Ayaka Hirahara.[28]\\n The closing song, \"Always With Me\" (いつも何度でも, \"Itsumo Nando Demo\", lit. \\'Always, No Matter How Many Times\\') was written and performed by Youmi Kimura, a composer and lyre-player from Osaka.[29] The lyrics were written by Kimura\\'s friend Wakako Kaku. The song was intended to be used for Rin the Chimney Painter (煙突描きのリン, Entotsu-kaki no Rin), a different Miyazaki film which was never released.[29] In the special features of the Japanese DVD, Hayao Miyazaki explains how the song in fact inspired him to create Spirited Away.[29] The song itself would be recognized as Gold at the 43rd Japan Record Awards.[30]\\n Besides the original soundtrack, there is also an image album, titled Spirited Away Image Album (千と千尋の神隠し\\u3000イメージアルバム, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi Imēji Arubamu), that contains 10 tracks.[31]\\n John Lasseter, Pixar animator and a fan and friend of Miyazaki, would often sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki\\'s work when encountering story problems. After seeing Spirited Away Lasseter was ecstatic.[32] Upon hearing his reaction to the film, Disney CEO Michael Eisner asked Lasseter if he would be interested in introducing Spirited Away to an American audience. Lasseter obliged by agreeing to serve as the executive producer for the English adaptation. Following this, several others began to join the project: Beauty and the Beast co-director Kirk Wise and Aladdin co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of Spirited Away, respectively.[32] Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote in order to match the characters\\' original Japanese-language lip movements.[11]\\n The cast of the film consists of Daveigh Chase, Jason Marsden, Suzanne Pleshette (in her final film role before her death in January 2008), Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, David Ogden Stiers and John Ratzenberger (a Pixar regular). Advertising was limited, with Spirited Away being mentioned in a small scrolling section of the film section of Disney.com; Disney had sidelined their official website for Spirited Away[32] and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget.[19] Marc Hairston writing for FPS Magazine argues that this was a justified response to Studio Ghibli\\'s retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney\\'s ability to properly market the film.[19]\\n \\nThe major themes of Spirited Away, heavily influenced by Japanese Shinto-Buddhist folklore, centre on the protagonist, Chihiro, and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including kami, come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths.[7] Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this: In my grandparents\\' time, it was believed that kami existed everywhere\\xa0– in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything.[7] Chihiro\\'s archetypal entrance into another world changes her status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word kamikakushi (literally \\'hidden by gods\\') within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: \"Kamikakushi is a verdict of \\'social death\\' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant \\'social resurrection.\\'\"[33]\\n Additional themes are expressed through No-Face, who reflects the characters who surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face\\'s monstrous rampage through the bathhouse. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At the end of the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.[34]\\n The film has been compared to Lewis Carroll\\'s Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, as the stories are set in fantasy worlds, involve disturbances in logic and stability, and there are motifs such as food having metamorphic qualities; though other developments and themes are not shared.[35][36][37]\\n Yubaba has many similarities to the Coachman from the 1940 film Pinocchio, in the sense that she mutates humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of Pleasure Island were mutated into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba\\'s seizure of Chihiro\\'s true name symbolically kills the child,[38] who must then assume adulthood. She then undergoes a rite of passage according to the monomyth format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.[38]\\n Spirited Away contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues.[39] Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the shōjo, whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.[39] Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity, Japan, in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in 2001, sought to reconnect to past values.[38] In an interview, Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan.[40]\\n Japanese philosophy plays a huge role in Spirited Away, specifically through concepts like Kami and principles like Mottainai and On.[41] The concept of Kami, for instance, involves various spirits that each represent different elements and aspects of nature. The principle of Mottainai, which is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, embodies a sense of regret towards waste, valuing the complete utilization of an object or resource. While the principle of On, a key tenet of Japanese ethics that signifies a sense of moral indebtedness, plays a significant role in Chihiro\\'s character development.\\n Similar to the Japanese concept of On, the film can be partly understood as an exploration of the effect of greediness and Western consumerism on traditional Japanese culture.[42] For instance, Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing a Western dress and living among European décor and furnishings, in contrast with the minimalist Japanese style of her employees\\' quarters, representing the Western capitalist influence over Japan in its Meiji period and beyond. Along with its function within the ostensible coming of age theme, Yubaba\\'s act of taking Chihiro\\'s name and replacing it with Sen (an alternate reading of chi, the first character in Chihiro\\'s name, lit.\\u2009\\'one thousand\\') can be thought of as symbolic of capitalism\\'s single-minded concern with value.[39]\\n \\nThe film\\'s setting encapsulates Miyazaki\\'s commentary on modern Japanese values and the erosion of cultural heritage. The bathhouse, situated within an abandoned theme park, symbolizes Japan\\'s distorted cultural identity. This once-traditional locale is marred by neon signs and Westernization, exemplifying cultural degradation. Early scenes highlight economic concerns and consumerism. The film\\'s visuals underscore the commercialization of Japanese culture. The failed theme park serves as a metaphor for the unsuccessful fusion of ideologies. The Meiji design of the park is the setting for Chihiro\\'s parents\\' metamorphosis\\xa0– the family arrives in an imported Audi car and the father wears a European-styled polo shirt, reassuring Chihiro that he has \"credit cards and cash\", before morphing into literal consumerist pigs because of their bad habits.[43] Miyazaki has stated: Chihiro\\'s parents turning into pigs symbolizes how some humans become greedy. At the very moment Chihiro says there is something odd about this town, her parents turn into pigs. There were people that \"turned into pigs\" during Japan\\'s bubble economy (consumer society) of the 1980s, and these people still haven\\'t realized they\\'ve become pigs. Once someone becomes a pig, they don\\'t return to being human but instead gradually start to have the \"body and soul of a pig\". These people are the ones saying, \"We are in a recession and don\\'t have enough to eat.\" This doesn\\'t just apply to the fantasy world. Perhaps this isn\\'t a coincidence and the food is actually (an analogy for) \"a trap to catch lost humans\".[42] The bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness.[44] Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present;[39] it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of No-Face.[45] In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro\\'s journey and transformation is the constantly chaotic carnival in the background.[39]\\n Commentators have often referred to environmental themes in the films of Miyazaki. In Spirited Away, two major instances of allusions to environmental issues have been noted. Pam Coats, for example, a Vice President of Walt Disney Feature Animation, describes Chihiro dealing with the \"stink spirit\", who, it turns out, is actually a river spirit but is so corrupted with filth that one cannot tell what it is at first glance. It only becomes clean again when Chihiro pulls out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go.[46]\\n The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans\\' need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and destruction of natural habitats; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals\\' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but do not think about how it can affect other living things.[47][48]\\n Spirited Away was released theatrically in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho. It grossed a record ¥1.6 billion ($13.1 million) in its first three days, beating the previous record set by Princess Mononoke.[49] It was number one at the Japanese box office for its first eleven weeks and spent 16 weeks there in total.[50] After 22 weeks of release and after grossing $224 million in Japan, it started its international release, opening in Hong Kong on 13 December 2001.[51] It was the first film that had grossed more than $200 million at the worldwide box office excluding the United States.[52][53] It went on to gross ¥30.4 billion to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, according to the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan.[54] It also set the all-time attendance record in Japan, surpassing the 16.8 million tickets sold by Titanic.[55] Its gross at the Japanese box office has since increased to ¥31.68 billion, as of 2020[update].[56][57]\\n In February 2002, Wild Bunch, an international sales company that had recently spun off from its former parent StudioCanal, picked up the international sale rights for the film outside of Asia and France.[58] The company would then on-sell it to independent distributors across the world. On 13 April 2002, The Walt Disney Company acquired the Taiwanese, Singapore, Hong Kong, French and North American sale rights to the film, alongside Japanese Home Media rights.[59]\\n Disney\\'s English dub of the film, supervised by Lasseter, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2002[60] and was later released in the United States on 20 September 2002. The film grossed $450,000 in its opening weekend from 26 theatres. Spirited Away had very little marketing, less than Disney\\'s other B-films, with a maximum of 151 theatres showing the film in 2002.[19] After the 2003 Oscars,[61] it expanded to 714 theatres. It ultimately grossed around $10 million by September 2003.[62] Outside of Japan and the United States, the movie was moderately successful in both South Korea and France where it grossed $11 million and $6 million, respectively.[63] In Argentina, it is in the top 10 anime films with the most tickets sold.[64]\\n In the United Kingdom, then-independent based film distributor Optimum Releasing acquired the rights to the movie from Wild Bunch in January 2003.[65] The company then released it theatrically on 12 September 2003.[66][67] The movie grossed $244,437 on its opening weekend from 51 theatres, and by the end of its theatrical run in October, the movie has grossed $1,383,023 in the country.[68]\\n About 18 years after its original release in Japan, Spirited Away had a theatrical release in China on 21 June 2019. It follows the theatrical China release of My Neighbour Totoro in December 2018.[69] The delayed theatrical release in China was due to long-standing political tensions between China and Japan, but many Chinese became familiar with Miyazaki\\'s films due to rampant video piracy.[70] It topped the Chinese box office with a $28.8-million opening weekend, beating Toy Story 4 in China.[71] In its second weekend, Spirited Away grossed a cumulative $54.8 million in China, and was second only behind Spider-Man: Far From Home that weekend.[72] As of 16\\xa0July\\xa02019[update], the film has grossed $70 million in China,[73] bringing its worldwide total box office to over $346 million as of 8\\xa0July\\xa02019[update].[74]\\n Spirited Away\\'s worldwide box office total stands at US$395,802,070.[a]\\n Spirited Away was first released on VHS and DVD formats in Japan by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on 19 July 2002.[75] The Japanese DVD releases include storyboards for the film and the special edition includes a Ghibli DVD player.[76] Spirited Away sold 5.5\\xa0million home video units in Japan by 2007,[77] and holds the record for most home video copies sold of all-time in the country as of 2014[update].[78] The movie was released on Blu-ray by Walt Disney Studios Japan on 14 July 2014, and DVD was also reissued on the same day with a new HD master, alongside several other Studio Ghibli movies.[79][80]\\n In North America, the film was released on DVD and VHS formats by Walt Disney Home Entertainment on 15 April 2003.[81] The attention brought by the Oscar win resulted in the film becoming a strong seller.[82] The bonus features include Japanese trailers, a making-of documentary which originally aired on Nippon Television, interviews with the North American voice actors, a select storyboard-to-scene comparison and The Art of Spirited Away, a documentary narrated by actor Jason Marsden.[83] The movie was released on Blu-ray by and North America by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on 16 June 2015.[84] GKIDS and Shout! Factory re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on 17 October 2017 following the expiration of Disney\\'s previous deal with Studio Ghibli in the country in North America.[85] On 12 November 2019, GKIDS and Shout! Factory issued a North-America-exclusive Spirited Away collector\\'s edition, which includes the film on Blu-ray, and the film\\'s soundtrack on CD, as well as a 40-page book with statements by Toshio Suzuki and Hayao Miyazaki, and essays by film critic Kenneth Turan and film historian Leonard Maltin.[86][87] Along with the rest of the Studio Ghibli films, Spirited Away was released on digital markets in the United States for the first time, on 17 December 2019.\\n In the United Kingdom, the film was released on DVD and VHS as a rental release through independent distributor High Fliers Films PLC following the film\\'s limited theatrical release. It was later officially released on DVD in the UK on 29 March 2004, with the distribution being done by Optimum Releasing themselves.[88] In 2006, the DVD was reissued as a single-disc release (without the second one) with packaging matching other releases in Optimum\\'s \"The Studio Ghibli Collection\" range.[89] The then-renamed StudioCanal UK released the movie on Blu-ray on 24 November 2014, A British 20th Anniversary Collector\\'s Edition, similar to other Studio Ghibli anniversary editions released in the UK, was released on 25 October 2021.[90]\\n In the United States, the 2015 Blu-ray release grossed $9,925,660 from 557,613 physical units sold as of 21\\xa0February\\xa02021[update].[91] In the United Kingdom, the film\\'s Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared several times on the annual lists of best-selling foreign language film on home video, ranking number six in 2015,[92] number five in 2016,[93] and number one in 2019.[94]\\n The film was aired on Nippon TV (NTV) in Japan, on 24 January 2003. It became NTV\\'s most-watched film of all time with a 46.9% audience rating, surpassing the 35.1% record previously set by Princess Mononoke in 1999.[95]\\n In the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 670,000 viewers on BBC2 in 2010. This made it the year\\'s most-watched foreign-language film on BBC, and the year\\'s second highest foreign film on UK television (below the Indian Bollywood film Om Shanti Om).[96] Spirited Away was later watched by 300,000 UK viewers on BBC2 in 2011, making it the year\\'s most-watched foreign-language film on BBC2.[97] Combined, the film drew a 970,000 UK television viewership on BBC2 between 2010 and 2011.\\n Spirited Away received widespread acclaim. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website\\'s critics consensus reads, \"Spirited Away is a dazzling, enchanting, and gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by the world around them.\"[98] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 96 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[12]\\n Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a full four stars, praising the work and Miyazaki\\'s direction. Ebert also said that Spirited Away was one of \"the year\\'s best films\", as well as adding it to his \"Great Movies\" list.[99] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times positively reviewed the film and praised the animation. Mitchell drew a favorable comparison to Lewis Carroll\\'s Through the Looking-Glass, and wrote that Miyazaki\\'s \"movies are as much about moodiness as mood\" and that \"the prospect of animated figures\\' not being what they seem\\xa0– either spiritually or physically\\xa0– heightens the tension\".[37] Derek Elley of Variety said that Spirited Away \"can be enjoyed by sprigs and adults alike\" and praised the animation and music.[100] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times praised Miyazaki\\'s direction and the voice acting, as well as saying that the film is the \"product of a fierce and fearless imagination whose creations are unlike anything a person has seen before.\"[101] Orlando Sentinel\\'s critic Jay Boyar also praised Miyazaki\\'s direction and said the film is \"the perfect choice for a child who has moved into a new home.\"[102]\\n In 2004, Cinefantastique listed the film as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\".[103] In 2005, Spirited Away was ranked by IGN as the 12th-best animated film of all time.[104] The film is also ranked number 9 of the highest-rated movies of all time on Metacritic, being the highest rated traditionally animated film on the site. The film ranked number 10 in Empire magazine\\'s \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.[105] In 2010, Rotten Tomatoes ranked it as the 13th-best animated film on the site,[106] and in 2012, as the 17th.[107] In 2019, the site considered the film to be #1 among 140 essential animated movies to watch.[108] The film was ranked at number 46 on Time Out magazine\\'s list of \"The 100 Best Movies of All Time\".[109] The film is listed within the top ten on the British Film Institute\\'s list of \"Top 50 films for children up to the age of 14\".[110] In 2016, it was voted the fourth-best film of the 21st century by the BBC, as picked by 177 film critics from around the world, making it the highest-ranking animated film on the list.[111] In 2017, The New York Times ranked it as the second best film of the 21st Century so far.[112] In 2021, the Writers Guild of America ranked Spirited Away\\'s screenplay the 67th greatest of the 21st century so far.[113] In 2022, the film was ranked number 75 on Sight & Sound\\'s greatest films list, being one of two animated films to make the list (alongside Miyazaki\\'s own My Neighbor Totoro).[114][115]\\n In his book Otaku, Hiroki Azuma observed: \"Between 2001 and 2007, the otaku forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan,\" and cites Miyazaki\\'s win at the Academy Awards for Spirited Away among his examples.[116]\\n Spirited Away is frequently regarded as one of the best films of the 21st century as well as one of the greatest animated films ever made.[122][123][124] Comic Book Resources wrote that the film \"set the bar extremely high for all anime movies that followed it – including Studio Ghibli\\'s\" and further explained that \"It\\'s a movie many people re-watch due to its comfort and nostalgia, and since Netflix brought the Ghibli movies to North America last year, it\\'s become even more accessible\".[125] Swapnil Dhruv Bose from Far Out Magazine declared the film to be \"the greatest animated film of all time\" and explained that it \"resonated with audiences all over the world despite the existence of cultural barriers is because of its brilliantly devised universality\" and has the ability to \"generate fascinating multiplicities which morph according to the age of the viewer\". In another article detailing Hayao Miyazaki\\'s wide impact to the film industry, he wrote \"The influence of Spirited Away can be easily observed in Disney productions like Brave and Frozen, thanks to John Lasseter\\'s (the Chief Creative Officer of Pixar) efforts to introduce it to Western audiences\".[126][127] Vice also declared Spirited Away to be the all-time best animated film and wrote that the film \"showed how breathtaking, heartfelt, and serious animation can be\" that \"Pixar, Disney, and other mainstream animators have still failed to genuinely realize 15 years later\".[128]\\n Film director Steven Spielberg said that Spirited Away might be \"better than any Disney films\" he has ever seen.[129] Rayna Denison, professor of film, television, and media studies, told Time that \"This is a film made by a master animator at the height of his powers and it is one where the quality of the animation really does set it apart from everything else around it. Nobody else was making films that looked like this or that were as inventive as this was at this time\".[130] The film has been cited as influence for various Disney and Pixar animated films. Production designer Harley Jessup said that he initially looked at Spirited Away and was inspired by the spiritual feelings elements to utilize them in Coco.[131] Co-writers Ken and Ryan Firpo cited the film as one of the influences that helps them explore \"ideas of morality and humanity\" in Eternals.[132] Turning Red\\'s director Domee Shi named Spirited Away as one of her favorite animated films and one of the influences for her film.[133]\\n According to Time, Spirited Away \"arrived at a time when animation was widely perceived as a genre solely for children, and when cultural differences often became barriers to the global distribution of animated works\" but it \"shattered preconceived notions about the art form and also proved that, as a film created in Japanese with elements of Japanese folklore central to its core, it could resonate deeply with audiences around the world\". Denison emphasized that John Lasseter and Disney \"boosted Spirited Away\\'s visibility in America by heavily campaigning for the film to be considered for the Academy Awards\", and cited it as one of the reasons why it won Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[134] Writer Jonathan Clements, whose published works revolve around East Asian culture, anime, and Japanese television dramas, emphasized that the film\\'s Oscar win was \"a wake-up call for a lot of people in the film business who had been disregarding Japanese animation for years\".[135] Susan Napier, professor of Japanese studies at Tufts University, called Spirited Away\\'s wins at major Western award shows \"a very big shot in the arm to the Japanese animation industry\". She further explained that cartoons in the West have often been seen as \"childish, vulgar, things that you didn\\'t take seriously\" but after the film took home the Academy Award, people were starting to see animation as \"a real art form\".[136][page\\xa0needed]\\n A stage adaptation of Spirited Away was announced in February 2021 with a world premiere planned in Tokyo on 28 February 2022. It is written and directed by John Caird, with Toho as the production company, with Studio Ghibli\\'s blessing. The role of Chihiro is played by both Kanna Hashimoto and Mone Kamishiraishi.[137][138] In August 2023, it was announced that the production would have its European premiere at the London Coliseum from April 2024,[139] with most of the cast reprising their roles.[140]\\n On a limited time release from 11 November to 18 December in 2022,[141][142] the Imperial Theater performance of the play was available for rental in Japan in several streaming services such as Abema, Amazon Prime Video Japan, Docomo Anime Store, FOD, Hulu Japan and U-Next.[143]\\n There were 2 versions of the play available for rental:', 'Princess Mononoke (Japanese: もののけ姫, Hepburn: Mononoke-hime) is a 1997 Japanese animated epic historical fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network and Dentsu. The film stars the voices of Yōji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Tsunehiko Kamijo, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori, and Hisaya Morishige.\\n Set in the late Muromachi period of Japan (approximately 1336 to 1573 AD) and including fantasy elements, the story follows a young Emishi prince named Ashitaka, and his involvement in a struggle between the gods (kami) and spirits (yōkai) of a forest against the humans who consume its resources. The film deals with a recurrent theme in Studio Ghibli work: environmentalism as a reaction against over-industrialization within the context of Shintoism, animism, and folklore.[1][2][3]\\n Princess Mononoke was released in Japan on July 12, 1997, by Toho, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. A critical and commercial success, the film became the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and also held Japan\\'s box office record for domestic films until 2001\\'s Spirited Away, another Miyazaki film. It was dubbed into English with a script by Neil Gaiman and initially distributed in North America by Miramax, where it sold well on home media despite not performing strongly at the box office.[4] The film greatly increased Ghibli\\'s popularity and influence outside Japan.[5][6]\\n In Muromachi Japan, an Emishi village is attacked by a hideous demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but it grasps his arm and curses him before its death. The curse grants him superhuman strength, but it also causes him pain and it will eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village\\'s wise woman, Hī-sama, tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands that the demon came from, and that he cannot return to his homeland.\\n Heading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo, an opportunistic monk who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a  deer-like animal god by day and a giant Nightwalker by night. Nearby, men on a cliffside herd oxen to their home of Iron Town, led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro, whom Eboshi wounds with a gunshot. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Down below, Ashitaka encounters San and the wolves, who rebuff his greeting. He then rescues two of the men fallen from the cliff and transports them back through the forest, where he briefly glimpses the Great Forest Spirit.\\n Ashitaka and the survivors arrive at Iron Town, where he is greeted with fascination. Iron Town is a refuge for outcasts and lepers employed to process iron and create firearms, such as hand cannons and matchlock muskets. Ashitaka learns that the town was built by clearcutting forests to mine the iron, leading to conflicts with Asano, a daimyō (kanrei[7]), and a giant boar god named Nago. Eboshi admits that she shot Nago, incidentally turning him into the demon that attacked Ashitaka\\'s village. She also reveals that San — dubbed Princess Mononoke, a supernatural spirit of retribution — was raised by the wolves and hates humankind.\\n San infiltrates Iron Town and fights Eboshi, but Ashitaka intervenes and subdues them both. Amidst the hysteria, a villager with a firearm shoots him, but the curse gives him strength to carry San out of the village. San wakes and tries killing the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he compliments her beauty. She decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit heals his bullet wound that night. The next day, a boar clan led by the blind god Okkoto plans to attack Iron Town to save the forest. Eboshi sets out to kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo. Eboshi intends to give the god\\'s head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality) in return for protection from Asano, while Jigo desires the large reward being offered.\\n Ashitaka recovers and finds Iron Town besieged by Asano\\'s samurai and jizamurai.[7] The boar clan has been annihilated in battle, and Okkoto is badly wounded. Jigo\\'s men trick Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries stopping Okkoto but is swept up as his pain corrupts him into a demon. As everyone clashes at the pool of the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka rescues San while the Forest Spirit euthanizes Moro and Okkoto. As it begins to transform into the Nightwalker Eboshi decapitates it. Jigo steals the head, while the Forest Spirit\\'s body bleeds ooze that spreads over the land and kills anything it touches. The forest and its spirits begin to die. Moro\\'s head briefly comes alive and bites off Eboshi\\'s right arm, but she survives. An enraged San tries killing Eboshi, but is stopped by Ashitaka, who consoles her and encourages her not to give up.\\n After Iron Town is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit. The Spirit dies but its form washes over the land, healing it and lifting Ashitaka\\'s curse. Ashitaka stays to help rebuild Iron Town, but promises San he will visit her in the forest. Eboshi vows to build a better town and the forest begins to regrow.\\n Miyazaki composed the preliminary ideas for what would become Princess Mononoke shortly after the release of his first film The Castle of Cagliostro\\xa0(1979),[10] drawing sketches of a princess living in the woods with a beast.[11] After unsuccessfully proposing the project to several production companies, Miyazaki published his concepts in a 1983 book,[12] republished in 2014 as Princess Mononoke: The First Story.[13] While being set in Japan, the concept had strong similarities to the fairy tale \"Beauty and the Beast\"\\xa0(1740). According to film scholar Rayna Denison, the differences that can be discerned between the original idea and the final film demonstrate the radical change of Miyazaki\\'s filmmaking philosophies.[10] Upon the completion of his manga series Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind\\xa0(1994), Miyazaki began work on the project proposal for the film in April 1994.[14] However, encountering writer\\'s block in December of that year, he decided to take a break from the production and direct the short film On Your Mark\\xa0(1995) as a side project.[15] Miyazaki returned to the film and began working on the storyboards in April 1995.[16]\\n To achieve the environmental depiction that he was seeking to portray, Miyazaki and four art directors visited the island of Yakushima in May 1995.[17] Additionally, art director Kazuo Oga went to the Shirakami-Sanchi mountains, which had already inspired some environments in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.[18]\\n Miyazaki did not want to create an accurate history of Medieval Japan, and wanted to \"portray the very beginnings of the seemingly insoluble conflict between the natural world and modern industrial civilization.\" Despite being set during the Muromachi period, the actual time period of Princess Mononoke depicts a \"symbolic neverwhen clash of three proto-Japanese races (the Jomon, Yamato and Emishi).\"[19]\\n Princess Mononoke was produced with a budget of ¥2.35 billion (US$19.6 million; US$36.6 million in 2023), making it the most expensive Japanese animation at the time.[20] The film used 144,000 cels, 80,000 of them being key animation frames, more than any other Studio Ghibli film.[21] Miyazaki is estimated to have drawn or retouched nearly 80,000 cels himself.[22] The animation production commenced in July 1995.[16] The final storyboards were finished in June 1997.[16]\\n Princess Mononoke was realized with a combination of hand-drawn animation and computer-generated imagery; approximately five minutes of the film were animated entirely using digital processes. A further ten minutes use digital ink and paint, a technique used in all subsequent Studio Ghibli films.[24] The company\\'s hand-drawn methods were becoming outdated by the late 1990s,[25] and in a 1997 interview with members of the computer graphics team at Studio Ghibli, they felt that the adoption was made largely out of necessity.[26] While Studio Ghibli had already begun experimenting with digital techniques a few years prior on Pom Poko\\xa0(1994), its computer graphics department was opened during the production of Princess Mononoke.[27]\\n Miyazaki\\'s distaste for digital animation techniques were well known in Japan before the film\\'s release, so his use of computer graphics came as a surprise to audiences.[28] The decision to use computer graphics was made early in the production at his request, starting with the opening sequence with the demon god.[29] Certain sequences in the film were created using 3D tools, then processed to resemble a traditionally-animated sequence using a program called Toon Shader.[30] Some of this work was outsourced to the animation studio Toyo Links.[31] Three broad categories of digital techniques were applied to the animation: use of digital ink and paint to finish coloring hand-drawn frames, 3D rendering and digital compositing, which put the hand-drawn images in a three-dimensional environment to create more visual depth, and morphing and particle effects, which create additional detail and smoother transitions.[32] Yoshinori Sugano\\xa0[ja], head of the computer graphics department, recalled that the most involved use of digital techniques were to mask the transitions between the digital and hand-drawn elements on screen. Some characters, particularly the gods, alternate being rendered with each approach between shots.[23]\\n Environmentalism is a central theme of Princess Mononoke,[33] and the violent schism between the people of Irontown and the forest spirits are an allegory of the modern conflicts of human industry with the natural world.[34] In a 1998 interview at the Berlin International Film Festival, Miyazaki stated that he \"meant to state [his] objection to the way environmental issues are treated\",[35] referring to the general exclusion of humanity\\'s role in environmental discourse in Japan.[36] Setting the film in the Muromachi period allowed him to depict the country before it had been deforested and altered by rice agriculture,[37] and positions the film within the moment of history when \"humankind pushed nature into submission\", according to the animation writers Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy.[19] The film scholars Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc wrote that the film simultaneously mounts a criticism of humanity\\'s mistreatment of the natural world and \"grudgingly admits\" that some disputes are inevitable to facilitate technological progress.[38] The film presents several themes similarly to the manga Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, which Miyazaki had completed in 1994,[39] namely the \"environmental catastrophe, the role of technology and warfare, and human interactions with nonhuman species\", according to Napier.[40] The film scholar Raz Greenberg also found similarities with Miyazaki\\'s earlier manga Shuna\\'s Journey\\xa0(1983), which he wrote created the \"narrative frame\" upon which Princess Mononoke\\'s plot is built; both works feature the protagonists leaving their homes, witnessing the depravities of humanity, and entering the domain of gods.[41]\\n Benjamin Thevenin, a media arts scholar, analyzed the film within the idiosyncratic context of melodrama and wrote that the \"nuanced environmental perspective\" that Miyazaki seeks to communicate is accomplished through an effective use of conventional techniques of the dramatic style.[34] For example, he noted the film presented novel and complex animation techniques with a focus on action sequences and drew a parallel to the use of spectacle as a device in conventional melodramatic works.[42] While Irontown is shown to be a haven for downtrodden members of society, who have the opportunity to live honest lives and enjoy fair treatment from Eboshi,[43] the conflict arises from the harm that the settlement causes to the surrounding environment. Greenberg identified this dynamic as a marked increase in complexity from Miyazaki\\'s earlier works, which typically presented a utopian model as an answer to social issues.[44] Additionally, the film portrays internal strife within parties on both sides of the conflict: the different clans of spirits disagree on how to handle the conflict and the humans war amongst themselves for various reasons.[45] According to the film critic Roger Ebert, Princess Mononoke is not a \"simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals, and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order.\"[46]\\n Napier wrote that \"the sense of a broken heterogeneous world is stridently manifest\" within Princess Mononoke.[47] Although some aspects of the film\\'s storytelling align with the tropes of melodrama, the complexity to which Miyazaki develops the characters and his eschewal of a definite narrative resolution stand in contrast to the typical approach to a melodramatic style, which may use stereotypes and straightforward morals in service of the allegorical plot.[42] In a speech in 2016, Miyazaki explained that he was inspired to portray people living with leprosy, \"said to be an incurable disease caused by bad karma\", after visiting the Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium near his home in Tokyo.[48] Miyazaki attributed this to his experience of making his previous film, Porco Rosso\\xa0(1992), and the wars in the former Yugoslavia, which he cited as an example of humankind never learning, making it difficult for him to go back to making a film such as Kiki\\'s Delivery Service\\xa0(1989), where he explained: \"It felt like children were being born to this world without being blessed. How could we pretend to them that we\\'re happy?\"[49]\\n Princess Mononoke marked the first time Miyazaki explored a jidaigeki style – a period drama focusing on the lives of historic Japanese peoples.[50] According to Napier, the film presents a much \"grimmer\" tone than his previous works, inspired by Japanese literary classic Hōjōki\\xa0(1212).[51] The film also subverts many traditional elements of the jidaigeki genre, such as the portrayals of the Emperor and the samurai as sacred and noble.[52] Additionally, Miyazaki chooses not to follow typical depictions of the Muromachi period such as the development of high culture or Zen aesthetics in Kyoto,[53] opting to focus on the beauty and danger of the natural landscape.[54] Additionally, the film exaggerates the historical perspective in order to facilitate the narrative; Irontown, for example, is inspired primarily by metalworking settlements in China,[55] and the clothing of the girls in Ashitaka\\'s village are influenced by styles from Bhutan and Thailand.[56] However, according to animation scholar Helen McCarthy, Miyazaki was drawn to the period as the Japanese people \"began to feel they could control nature, rather than placate or worship it\".[16]\\n The promotional strategy was spearheaded by the film\\'s producer, Toshio Suzuki, who by 1997 had already developed relationships within the media industry while promoting previous Studio Ghibli releases.[57] Napier noted that the marketing put the film under the Studio Ghibli brand for the first time – as opposed to previous works that were labeled primarily as Miyazaki films – which she felt reflected Suzuki\\'s rising position as Ghibli\\'s main producer.[58] According to Suzuki, three important elements of the campaign were the repeated use of a recognizable title logo, key imagery from the film, and a tagline.[59] The tagline underwent several iterations before, with Suzuki\\'s input, the final phrase was chosen: \"Live.\"[60] Suzuki also changed the title from the original intention of The Legend of Ashitaka,[a] without Miyazaki\\'s initial approval, as he found it less interesting.[62] The budget allotted for the film\\'s promotion was at least ¥2.6 billion, even higher than the production budget, making it the largest film advertisement campaign in Japan at the time.[63] The film scholar Shiro Yoshioka argued that the commercial success of Princess Mononoke was essential to make up the large production budget, and the scale of its campaign was significantly expanded from previous films\\'.[57] A number of preview screenings were organized before the release to advertise the film by word of mouth. 130 of them were originally scheduled and 70 were ultimately held, a number that the film scholar Seiji Kanō still found \"astonishing\"; Miyazaki\\'s previous film Porco Rosso had had only 23 screenings by comparison.[64]\\n Following the distribution deal struck between Walt Disney Studios and Studio Ghibli\\'s then–parent company Tokuma Shoten in 1997, the film would be the first among Miyazaki\\'s works to receive a worldwide release. While the arrangement did extend the studio\\'s reach to new regions, the announcement was made primarily to attract audiences locally.[65] Miyazaki also hinted that he might retire following the film\\'s release, further piquing audience interest.[66] The film was marketed as a split between an anime and an art house film but avoided advertising in the mainstream ahead of its release.[67] Denison felt that this choice was indicative of the studio\\'s initial lack of confidence in the film\\'s commercial viability[68] and a perception of its financial riskiness.[69] Yasuyoshi Tokuma\\xa0[ja], the head of Tokuma Shoten, said in an interview before the film\\'s release that it would be a \"huge success\" just to make back the investments that had been put into the film.[70] Denison argued, however, that the scale of the marketing campaign that was organized revealed the studio\\'s aim to achieve a commercial success;[68] she interpreted this approach to the release as a \"local equivalent of the \\'calculated\\' blockbuster film.\"[71]\\n Princess Mononoke was released theatrically in Japan on July 12, 1997,[72] to immense public anticipation.[66] The film was screened at 260 of the country\\'s 1800 cinemas,[73] many of which reported people queueing to purchase tickets in previously unseen numbers.[66] The Japanese specialist magazine Animage, which was published by Tokuma Shoten and had been closely associated with Studio Ghibli since the 1980s, released special issues for the film\\'s release, as did several other publications.[74] These featured articles from critics and academics covering several aspects of the film\\'s production as well as interviews with key staff.[75] According to Yoshioka, a variety of academics were attracted to write about the film as due to themes such as Japanese cultural history being relatively \"easy topics\" to cover, but also in response to Miyazaki\\'s growing status as a public intellectual (bunkajin) in the Japanese society.[76] Newspapers began to refer to the film\\'s release as the \"Mononoke phenomenon\",[66] as by the end of its first week, the film had brought in over a million viewers and earned ¥1.5 billion at the box office.[77] Advertising for the film labeled it a blockbuster (daihitto) and it increasingly competed with many high-profile films in the Japanese market, including Hollywood imports such as The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\xa0(1997).[78] By November, it had surpassed ¥9.65 billion in distribution rental sales, breaking the national record previously held by E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\\xa0(1982).[77] 12\\xa0million people, a tenth of Japan\\'s population at the time, had come to see the film in theaters during that period.[79] A year after the film\\'s release, it had attracted over 14.2\\xa0million viewers[77] and earned ¥11.3 billion in gross revenue,[57] making it the all-time highest-grossing film in the country.[b]\\n As part of the Disney–Tokuma deal, the film was handed over to Miramax Films, a Disney subsidiary at the time, to dub and distribute in the United States and other regions.[80] The dub was directed by Jack Fletcher, who had previously worked on the dubs of other Studio Ghibli films such as Kiki\\'s Delivery Service\\xa0(1989),[81] and its script was written by the fantasy author Neil Gaiman, who was an unusual choice for anime localizations at the time, according to Denison.[82] In an interview, Gaiman claimed that Harvey Weinstein, who was the head of Miramax at the time, initially offered the role to the film director Quentin Tarantino, who had then recommended Gaiman instead. He was intending to decline the offer before being impressed by a scene in the film in which a stone wets in the falling rain, saying \"I have never seen anything like this. This is real filmmaking.\"[83] Steve Alpert, an executive at Studio Ghibli, provided assistance with the translation.[84]\\n Denison wrote that Miramax\\'s approach to the dub \"might be termed a project of indigenization\" motivated by an intent to form a new identity for the film outside of Japan.[85] The language scholar Jennifer\\xa0E. Nicholson wrote that the differences between the English dub and the original create a product more closely approaching an adaptation than a translation.[86] Cultural differences between the United States and Japan, amplified by the film\\'s discussion of specifically Japanese elements, resulted in a script that continually comingled the languages and cultures of the two.[87] Gaiman inserted dialog for off-screen characters, elucidating cultural concepts considered obscure for American audiences.[82] Humor in particular demanded significant alterations; Gaiman approached the issue by searching for an \"emotional equivalent\" for the lines instead of considering the reason the originals were humorous.[88] Gaiman recalled in later interviews that although he oversaw the writing process, alterations were sometimes made to the script without his knowledge. Several of the changes cut out terms that identified the setting of the film, such as substituting sake with wine, and removing mentions of Japan and China.[89] Nicholson felt these decisions to be clearly indicative of Miramax\\'s intent to unfasten the film from its cultural context and divorce it from history entirely.[90] Gaiman also recalled his drafts receiving contradictory corrections from both Miramax and Studio Ghibli, to which he responded by writing two sets of revisions and asking them to \"go fight it out amongst [themselves].\"[91]\\n The English-language release was marketed primarily as an art house film,[82] and the media scholar Emma Pett felt that choosing to use the Miramax label, rather than the family film–oriented Buena Vista label, advertised the film towards a \"middlebrow, culturally sophisticated audience\".[92] By this time, Weinstein had developed a reputation of importing and cutting films from overseas to appeal to domestic audiences.[83] However, among the terms of the distribution deal were that Studio Ghibli would approve and have ultimate control of the translation, and that the film would not have any time cut.[84] Weinstein attempted to convince Miyazaki and Suzuki otherwise, but was unsuccessful.[c] Gaiman said that Miramax subsequently rolled back the planned marketing campaign and opened the film in a very limited number of screens.[83] The English dub was screened for the first time at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival on February 11, 1998,[81] and officially premiered at the Avery Fisher Hall in New York City on September 26.[97] It did not perform well in the American box office, earning only US$2.3 million.[83]\\n In Japan, the film was released on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment in 1997, as well as by Tokuma Shoten in 1998.[98] By 2007, Princess Mononoke sold 4.4\\xa0million DVD units in Japan.[99]\\n The DVD release of Princess Mononoke in North America was not initially to include the Japanese audio track. Multiple online petitions were opened to retain it,[100] and the original August 2000 release was delayed as a result.[101] Miramax Home Entertainment released the DVD on December 19, 2000, with the original Japanese audio, the English dubbed audio and extras including a trailer and a documentary with interviews from the English dub voice actors.[102]\\n Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Princess Mononoke on Blu-ray on November 18, 2014. In its first week, it sold 21,860 units; by November 23, 2014, it had grossed US$502,332.[103] It was later included in Disney\\'s \"The Collected Works of Hayao Miyazaki\" Blu-ray set, released on November 17, 2015.[104] GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 17, 2017.[105] As of October\\xa02020[update], the film has grossed US$9.2 million from Blu-ray sales in the United States.[103]\\n In the United Kingdom, the film\\'s Studio Ghibli anniversary release appeared several times on the annual lists of bestselling foreign language film on home video, ranking number three in 2019, below Spirited Away (2001) and My Neighbor Totoro (1988).[106]\\n On April 29, 2000, the English version of Princess Mononoke was released theatrically in Japan.[72] The film had earned a total of US$11 million outside Japan, bringing its worldwide total to US$159 million at the time. The film has been rescreened in several runs around the world, including at the annual Studio Ghibli Fest organized by Gkids.[107] As of 2020[update], the film has grossed US$194.3 million.[108]\\n As with many of Miyazaki\\'s previous films, the film\\'s score was composed by Joe Hisaishi.[109] According to McCarthy, the development of the score involved a much closer collaboration between the two than on previous works.[110] Hisaishi first composed an image album – a collection of demos and musical sketches that serve as a precursor to the finished score – which he shared with Miyazaki and Suzuki.[110] The unused title The Legend of Ashitaka appears here as the title of the opening theme.[111] With their input, the demos were then worked into the final score, performed by the Tokyo City Philharmonic.[112] Tokuma Shoten released the image album in July 1996 and the soundtrack album in July 1997.[113] The vocal theme song performed by the countertenor singer Yoshikazu Mera was released as a single before the film\\'s release and became popular with Japanese audiences.[114] A third version of the soundtrack, arranged for symphony orchestra and performed by the Czech Philharmonic, was released in 1998.[115]\\n The vocal theme was re-recorded for the English dub by the American vocalist Sasha Lazard. Denison argued that this was a part of Miramax\\'s efforts to remove Japanese elements from the film. However, she also acknowledged that the score deviates substantially from a typical Hollywood-style compositional approach. Leitmotifs, for example, which are commonly used to represent characters or settings, are instead used in transitional moments between more significant narrative events.[114] McCarthy also wrote that the film complements the scenes featuring music and dialog with a liberal use of silence and ambient sounds to augment the tension of certain moments, a significant departure from American scoring approaches.[116] Hisaishi also uses Japanese pentatonic scales in conjunction with Western tonalities.[110]\\n On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 117 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website\\'s consensus reads, \"With its epic story and breathtaking visuals, Princess Mononoke is a landmark in the world of animation.\"[119] On Metacritic, it has an average score of 76 out of 100 based on 29 reviews, indictating \"generally favorable reviews\".[120]\\n The Daily Yomiuri\\'s Aaron Gerow called the film a \"powerful compilation of Miyazaki\\'s world, a cumulative statement of his moral and filmic concerns.\"[121] Leonard Klady of Variety said that Princess Mononoke \"is not only more sharply drawn, it has an extremely complex and adult script\" and the film \"has the soul of a romantic epic, and its lush tones, elegant score by Joe Hisaishi and full-blooded characterizations give it the sweep of cinema\\'s most grand canvases\".[122] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called Princess Mononoke \"a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year\", and awarded it a full four stars.[123] Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly called the film \"a windswept pinnacle of its art\" and that it \"has the effect of making the average Disney film look like just another toy story\".[124] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said that the film \"brings a very different sensibility to animation, a medium [Miyazaki] views as completely suitable for straight dramatic narrative and serious themes.\"[125] In his review, Dave Smith from Gamers\\' Republic called it \"one of the greatest animated films ever created, and easily one of the best films of 1999\".[126]\\n In 2001, Animage ranked Princess Mononoke 47th in their list of the 100 best anime.[127] It ranked 488th on Empire\\'s list of the 500 greatest films.[128] Time Out ranked the film 26th on 50 greatest animated films.[129] It also ranked 26 on Total Film\\'s list of 50 greatest animated films.[130]\\n Princess Mononoke was submitted by Japan to be nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Academy Awards but was ultimately unsuccessful.[131]\\n According to Napier, Princess Mononoke is \"considered by many to be Miyazaki\\'s most important work\".[40] The film\\'s release was a \"cultural phenomenon\" in Japan,[146] breaking box office records previously held only by Hollywood films, which Denison feels was \"reflective of a general trend towards the globalization of anime\".[147] James Cameron cited Princess Mononoke as an influence on his 2009 film Avatar. He acknowledged that it shares themes with Princess Mononoke, including its clash between cultures and civilizations, and cited Princess Mononoke as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[148]\\n In 2012, it was announced that Studio Ghibli and British theater company Whole Hog Theatre would be bringing Princess Mononoke to the stage. It is the first stage adaptation of a Studio Ghibli work.[149] The contact between Whole Hog Theatre and Studio Ghibli was facilitated by Nick Park of Aardman Animations after he sent footage of Whole Hog performances to Studio Ghibli\\'s Toshio Suzuki.[150] The play features large puppets made out of recycled and reclaimed materials.[151]\\n The first performances were scheduled for London\\'s New Diorama Theatre and sold out in 72 hours, a year in advance.[152][153] In March 2013, it was announced that the show would transfer to Japan after its first run of shows in London. A second series of performances followed in London after the return from Tokyo. The second run of London performances sold out in four and half hours.[154][155]', \"Howl's Moving Castle may refer to:\", 'Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind may refer to', 'Children of the Sea may refer to:', 'Castle in the Sky (Japanese: 天空の城ラピュタ, Hepburn: Tenkū no Shiro Rapyuta), also known as Laputa: Castle in the Sky, is a 1986 Japanese animated fantasy adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It was produced by Isao Takahata, animated by Studio Ghibli, and distributed by the Toei Company. In voice acting roles, the original Japanese version stars Mayumi Tanaka, Keiko Yokozawa, Kotoe Hatsui, and Minori Terada. The film follows orphans Sheeta and Pazu, who are pursued by government agent Muska, the army, and a group of pirates. They seek Sheeta\\'s crystal necklace, the key to accessing Laputa, a legendary flying castle hosting advanced technology.\\n Castle in the Sky is the first film to be animated by Studio Ghibli. Its production team included many of Miyazaki\\'s longtime collaborators, who would continue to work with the studio for the following three decades. The film was partly inspired by Miyazaki\\'s trips to Wales, where he witnessed the aftermath of the 1984–1985 coal miners\\' strike. The island of Laputa is used to highlight the theme of environmentalism, exploring the relationships between humanity, nature, and technology, a reflection of Miyazaki\\'s ecological philosophy. The young protagonists also provide a unique perspective on the narrative, as a result of Miyazaki\\'s desire to portray \"the honesty and goodness of children in [his] work.\"[1] Many aspects of the film\\'s retrofuturistic style – the flying machines in particular – are influenced by nineteenth-century approaches, which has earned the film a reputation in the modern steampunk genre.\\n The film was released in Japanese theaters on August 2, 1986. It underperformed expectations at the box office, but later achieved commercial success through rereleases, earning over US$157 million as of 2021. An English dub commissioned by Tokuma Shoten in 1988 was distributed in North America by Streamline Pictures, and another dub was produced by Disney in 1998, released internationally by Buena Vista in 2003. The film\\'s score was composed by Joe Hisaishi, who would become a close collaborator of Miyazaki\\'s; Hisaishi also composed a reworked soundtrack for the 2003 English dub. The film was generally acclaimed by critics, though the English dubs received mixed reviews. It was well-received by audiences, being voted as one of the greatest animated films in polls conducted by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and Oricon. The film also received several notable accolades, including the Ōfuji Noburō Award at the Mainichi Film Awards and the Anime Grand Prix from Animage. Castle in the Sky has since earned \"cult status\",[2] and has influenced several notable artists working in multiple media.\\n An airship carrying Sheeta – an orphan girl abducted by government agent Muska – is attacked by air pirate Dola and her gang, who seek Sheeta\\'s crystal necklace. Attempting to escape, Sheeta falls from the airship but is saved by the magic of the now-glowing crystal, which lowers her gently. She is caught by Pazu, an orphan who works as a mechanic in a 19th-century mining town, and he takes her to his home to recover. The next morning, Pazu shows Sheeta a picture his father took of Laputa, a mythical castle on a flying island, which Pazu now seeks. Dola\\'s gang and Muska\\'s soldiers shortly arrive looking for Sheeta. After a chase through the town, Pazu and Sheeta fall into a mine shaft, but are saved again by the crystal. In the tunnels, they meet Uncle Pom, who shows them deposits of the glowing mineral Aetherium, the same material as Sheeta\\'s crystal.\\n Sheeta reveals to Pazu that she has a secret name tying her to Laputa, proving the myth is real. The two are captured by the army and imprisoned in a fortress. Muska shows Sheeta a dead robot that fell from the sky, bearing the same insignia as on Sheeta\\'s crystal, and reveals she is the heiress to the Laputan throne. Muska releases Pazu under the condition that Sheeta guides the army to Laputa. Pazu returns home, but is captured by Dola\\'s gang, who prepare to fly to the fortress and take the crystal. Pazu joins them in an attempt to save Sheeta. In the fortress, Sheeta recites an ancient phrase her mother taught her and inadvertently activates the magic of the crystal, reanimating the robot. The robot protects Sheeta from the army and destroys the fortress with its weapons, but is destroyed in turn by the military airship Goliath. In the chaos, Pazu and Dola fly in and rescue Sheeta. However, Sheeta\\'s crystal is left behind, its magic still active, allowing Muska to use it to navigate to Laputa.\\n Sheeta having seen the crystal\\'s directions and being able to navigate to Laputa, she and Pazu convince Dola to take them there in exchange for temporarily joining her crew. In the middle of the night, Sheeta and Pazu keep watch from the crow\\'s nest when Dola\\'s airship is attacked by Goliath. Dola detaches the crow\\'s nest, which also functions as a glider attached to the ship with a line. Pazu spots a massive storm, wherein he believes his father saw Laputa. Dola attempts to steer into the clouds, but is halted by violent winds. Goliath destroys Dola\\'s airship, severing the line connecting it to the glider. Sheeta and Pazu pass through the turbulent lightning storm.\\n They land safely on Laputa, which they find deserted but for some fauna and one peaceful robot. The castle is in ruins, and a giant tree now grows out of the top of the island. The army arrives and begins looting the castle, having taken Dola\\'s gang captive. Muska and his accomplices betray the army, destroying their communication systems, and capture Sheeta, taking her into the core of the castle. Pazu frees Dola\\'s gang from their bindings and pursues Muska. The castle\\'s core is the center of Laputa\\'s ancient knowledge and weapons, which Muska activates using Sheeta\\'s crystal, revealing to her that he is also a descendant of the Laputan royal line. Muska demonstrates Laputa\\'s power by causing a massive explosion over the ocean and by destroying Goliath, declaring his intention to destroy humanity using Laputa, believing them inferior to himself and Sheeta. Horrified, Sheeta takes back the crystal and flees, but is cornered by a pursuing Muska in Laputa\\'s throne room.\\n Pazu appears and bargains for a brief truce. Sheeta teaches Pazu another ancient phrase, the spell of destruction, which they recite, causing Laputa to begin to collapse. The light of the spell blinds Muska, who falls to his death, while Sheeta and Pazu are protected by the giant tree\\'s roots. While Laputa\\'s bottom falls out, the rest of the castle – along with Dola\\'s glider – is preserved by the giant tree, and the island begins to rise into space. Sheeta, Pazu, and Dola\\'s gang are able to escape, and briefly reunite before flying away.\\n Following the commercial success of Miyazaki\\'s previous film, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), Miyazaki was eager to begin work on an old-fashioned adventure film that would be a \"pleasure\" to watch.[7] His first proposal for an animated feature film was based on a research trip to Yanagawa, tentatively titled \"Blue Mountains\".[8] The film was never produced, but it inspired Miyazaki\\'s longtime collaborator Isao Takahata to create The Story of Yanagawa\\'s Canals (1987), a documentary on the environmental effects of industry on the local waterways.[9] As Miyazaki was financing the project in large part through his personal office,[10] Animage editor Toshio Suzuki recommended that he direct another film to recover the expense, to which Miyazaki immediately agreed. He quickly developed a concept for the film based on an idea he had in elementary school. In 2014, Suzuki reflected on the events, saying \"If Takahata had made his movie on schedule, [Castle in the Sky] wouldn\\'t have been born.\"[11]\\n On June 15, 1985, Miyazaki and Takahata founded Studio Ghibli, with support from Suzuki and his publishing company Tokuma Shoten. Miyazaki chose the name himself,[12] referencing both the Arabic term for a warm wind from the Sahara, as well as the Caproni Ca.309 Ghibli, an aircraft used by the Italian military during the Second World War.[13] The intent behind the creation of the studio was to \"blow a whirlwind\" into a stagnating Japanese animation industry by creating original, high-quality feature films.[14] In a speech at the 1995 Annecy International Animation Film Festival, Suzuki said \"The idea was to dedicate full energy into each piece of work with sufficient budget and time, never compromising on the quality or content.\"[15]\\n Miyazaki first visited Wales on a research trip in 1985, when Castle in the Sky was in early stages of production. He decided to take inspiration from the architecture of the region, and as a result, some of the structures seen in the film resemble Welsh mining towns.[16] Miyazaki also witnessed the coal miners\\' strike in protest of mine closures in Britain. Their ultimate failure to preserve the industry left a lasting impact on Miyazaki, who viewed the event as an attack by those in power on the miners\\' way of life and the hard-working spirit of the people.[12] His experiences reflect in several supporting characters in the film, who despite laboring through poverty in the mines, enthusiastically protect the protagonists from multiple aggressors. Susan J. Napier argues that this depiction reveals Miyazaki\\'s yearning for a simpler way of life, and a desire to create a story based on optimism.[14] Animation scholar Helen McCarthy writes \"It seems that Castle in the Sky also contains echoes of the struggle of the Welsh people for nationhood and freedom.\"[17] Miyazaki would visit Wales once more in 1986, ahead of the release of the film. In 2005, he told The Guardian \"I admired those men, I admired the way they battled to save their way of life, just as the coal miners in Japan did. Many people of my generation see the miners as a symbol; a dying breed of fighting men. Now they are gone.\"[18]\\n Certain special effects from the film use a combination of cel and film techniques.[19] Takahata, who produced the film, insisted that the highest quality be maintained in spite of the production expense. Napier argues that the production of Castle in the Sky \"established a new industry standard\".[14] Miyazaki stated in the original project proposal that \"[Castle in the Sky] is a project to bring animation back to its roots.\"[20]\\n Many of Miyazaki\\'s old colleagues as well as much of the production crew of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind were employed once again to work on Castle in the Sky at Studio Ghibli\\'s inception.[12] The film had a reported production budget of ¥500 million, equivalent to US$8 million in 2023.[21] Several animation studios such as Doga Kobo and Oh! Production provided support for the in-between animation.[3]\\n Castle in the Sky contains a strong theme of environmentalism, questioning humanity\\'s relationship with nature and the role of technology.[22] McCarthy interprets the giant tree of Laputa as a \"metaphor for the reviving and life-giving power of nature.\"[23] However, in contrast with the more optimistic conclusions of Miyazaki\\'s previous works, Napier notes that the film ends with an \"unsettling view\" of the castle flying away, suggesting that humanity may not deserve to exist in the natural world.[24] Literary scholar Anthony Lioi interprets Laputa as an ecological utopia that demonstrates the peace that can be established between nature and advanced technology, but also serves as a criticism of modernity when \"[the] peace is shattered by human violence.\"[25] Lioi notes that this outlook differs from dominant Western ideas, eschewing the extremes of capitalism and industrialism, as well as radical environmentalism and conservationism.[25]\\n Critics note the philosophical ambiguity of the castle; while Laputa initially appears to be an ideal union of nature and technology, it is later revealed to have a much harsher and more oppressive underside;[23] Napier writes that Laputa is \"deeply paradoxical\".[26] Laputa itself takes direct inspiration from the island of the same name from Gulliver\\'s Travels (1726),[27] and film scholar Cristina Cardia claims that, like its namesake, the island is introduced with benign intentions but is ultimately \"exploited for perverse ends, in this case war.\"[28] Lioi argues that Laputa is used as a means to comment on the ethics of contemporary culture,[25] based on Ildney Cavalcanti\\'s observation that such a utopia also \"must contain an overtly dystopian element, such that the implicit critique in utopian discourse becomes explicit.\"[29] However, he interprets the ultimate destruction of the castle\\'s weapons as a demonstration that \"violence is not the heart of the city\", and that the dystopic elements of modernity can be healed.[25]\\n The film also presents an ambiguous view on the usage of technology.[30] The robots from Laputa provide an example of this view, as they are introduced in the film as a violent force capable of extreme destruction. However, when the protagonists next meet a robot, it is entirely peaceful, tending to the gardens and fauna on Laputa.[31] Lioi argues that the robots, as a representation of Laputan technology, are caretakers by default and only become destructive in response to human brutality.[25] McCarthy argues that \"this is not a comment on technology but on man\\'s inability to use it wisely.\"[32] Odell and Le Blanc conclude that \"technology\\xa0... is not necessarily a bad thing, but we must consider how it\\'s used and to what extent.\"[30] The duality of nature and technology is further explored in Miyazaki\\'s later film Princess Mononoke (1997).[30]\\n Like many other films by Miyazaki, Castle in the Sky features young children as protagonists.[33] Miyazaki values the portrayal of children as good-hearted, confident in their own agency, and resilient and upbeat in response to adversity.[34] He criticized reviewers of his television series Future Boy Conan (1978) who described the titular character as \"too much of a goody-two-shoes\", admitting he was tempted to retort \"So you want to see \\'bad characters\\', you fool?\"[35] Film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc argue that creating a film with younger protagonists generates perspectives that an adult would not perceive, saying \"the children in Ghibli\\'s films are a liberating force that allows anything to be possible.\"[36]\\n The lack of parental oversight of the protagonists is an element Miyazaki feels to be important in promoting children\\'s independence. The protagonists of his films are, like Sheeta and Pazu, often orphaned, or in some way parted from their parents.[37] Miyazaki believes that \"one of the essential elements of most classical children\\'s literature is that the children in the stories actually fend for themselves.\"[38] The presence of parents, in his opinion, would stifle the children\\'s autonomy.[39] The limitations that children have in their abilities are also explored in the film; for example, Pazu comes close to forsaking Sheeta and his quest for Laputa.[40] Additionally, unlike Miyazaki\\'s previous works, the protagonists do not succeed at convincing the antagonists of their wrongdoing, which offers a more pessimistic view on children\\'s ability to educate others.[40]\\n Napier proposes that Miyazaki\\'s insistence on showing the freedom of children in Castle in the Sky can be credited to the influence of Panda and the Magic Serpent (1958).[39] Miyazaki first watched the film at age 17, and it moved him to pursue a career in animation.[41] At a lecture given in 1982 at Waseda University, he said \"When I saw Panda and the Magic Serpent, it was as if the scales fell from my eyes; I realized that I should depict the honesty and goodness of children in my work.\" He considers this a focal point in his endeavors.[1] The theme of innocence is explored further in Miyazaki\\'s succeeding film My Neighbor Totoro (1988).[42]\\n Miyazaki\\'s affinity for flight is repeatedly displayed in Castle in the Sky, a motif that continues throughout the feature films of his career.[33] A variety of fictional flying machines appear across the film, including the island of Laputa, the airships, and the pirates\\' ornithopters; Sheeta\\'s crystal also allows her to float through the air.[43] However, many of the other flying machines in the film are retrofuturistic, influenced by nineteenth-century stylistic approaches.[44] Additionally, Miyazaki was inspired by the literature of Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson when considering the style of the film.[45]\\n Another stylistic trait that Miyazaki drew from nineteenth-century influences is the depiction of machines that \"still possess the inherent warmth of handcrafted things.\"[46] Literary scholars Jeff VanderMeer and S. J. Chambers argue that Pazu\\'s enthusiasm to build and work with flying machines gives the film\\'s airships \"a realistic physicality.\"[47] Commenting on the mecha anime popular at the time, Miyazaki expressed his hatred for shows that glorified machines without portraying the characters struggling to build or maintain them.[48] Animation scholar Thomas Lamarre argues that the film provides an \"alternative to our received technologies\" and thus a critique of more contemporary technologies and society\\'s perception of them.[49]\\n Boyes felt that many of these elements subsequently influenced the steampunk genre.[50] Napier writes that Verne\\'s impact on the film\\'s style was instrumental in evoking imagined nostalgia for a time when \"machines were still fun\", in Miyazaki\\'s words.[51] While the other machines are presented as joyful, Laputa\\'s underside is used exclusively as an instrument of destruction.[52] Miyazaki stated that, as a child, he was attracted to the design and power of military planes, a view that has since been replaced with revulsion for the indiscriminate acts of violence that the machines have been used for.[53] Miyazaki further explores the beauty of flying machines as well as their innate destructive potential in his later film The Wind Rises (2013).[54]\\n The film was released in Japan on August 2, 1986, by the Toei Company.[55] At the Japanese box office, the film sold about 775,000 tickets,[15] somewhat lower than the performance of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.[56] Miyazaki and Suzuki expressed their disappointment with the film\\'s box office figures.[57] The film was promoted with a tie-in fruit soda brand which animation scholar Rayna Denison described as an \"economic failure\".[58]\\n The film later earned a significant additional amount through rereleases;[14] as of 2021, it has grossed approximately US$157 million in box office, home video, and soundtrack sales.[59] In the United Kingdom, it was 2019\\'s eighth-best-selling foreign language film on home video, below five other Studio Ghibli films.[60] The film has sold approximately 1.1\\xa0million tickets in Europe as of 2023.[61] Multiple international theatrical rescreenings between 2003 and 2023 have earned the film approximately US$6.2 million.[62]\\n The first English dub of Castle in the Sky was produced by an unknown party[note 1] commissioned by Tokuma Shoten in 1988 for viewing on international flights on Japan Airlines; this dub was licensed between 1989 and 1991 by the then-new Streamline Pictures for distribution in North American markets.[68] An edited version of this dub briefly aired on UK television.[note 2] In addition to distribution rights, Streamline would go on to dub two other Studio Ghibli films in-house: My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki\\'s Delivery Service (1989).[70]\\n The English dub produced by Disney was recorded in 1998 and planned for release on video in 1999, but the release was postponed after Princess Mononoke did not perform well in North American theaters.[64] The film premiered at the New York International Children\\'s Film Festival on February 2, 2000.[3] It was released on home video in North America on April 15, 2003, alongside a rerelease of Kiki\\'s Delivery Service and Spirited Away (2001).[71] Due to the possible confusion of the title with the Spanish phrase la puta – literally \\'the whore\\' – the film was released as simply Castle in the Sky in North America.[72] The film was released by Buena Vista on Blu-ray in North America on May 22, 2012.[73] Shout! Factory and GKIDS re-issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD on October 31, 2017.[74] Both the original Japanese version and the 2003 English dub were made available for streaming when the rights to Studio Ghibli\\'s filmography were acquired by Netflix in 2020.[75]\\n As with Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Joe Hisaishi composed the soundtrack of Castle in the Sky.[76] Miyazaki and Hisaishi went on to become close collaborators, and Hisaishi has since provided the music for all of Miyazaki\\'s feature films.[77] Three months before the film\\'s theatrical release, the image album – a collection of demos and musical sketches that serve as a precursor to the finished score – was published by Tokuma on compact disc. A third version of the soundtrack, rearranged for full symphony orchestra and recorded by the Tokyo City Philharmonic, released in 1987 on compact disc.[76]\\n For the English dub produced by Disney in 1998, Hisaishi was called upon to rewrite the soundtrack to be more suitable for audiences in America. The new soundtrack was recorded by the Seattle Symphony and featured in the 2003 English dub released by Buena Vista.[78] Hisaishi was advised by Disney staff that non-Japanese audiences prefer comparatively more music in films. As a result, the American soundtrack is much longer, while the original Japanese version featured just an hour of music for a film exceeding two hours in length. Though Hisaishi felt that American film scores used an overly simplistic compositional approach, he commented \"But when I redid the music of Laputa this way, I learned a lot.\"[79]\\n The credits sequence of the film features an original vocal song titled \"Carrying You\" performed by Azumi Inoue, with music by Hisaishi and lyrics by Miyazaki. The song was released in 1988 as a compact disc single, featuring an additional chorus version performed by the Suginami Children\\'s Choir.[80]\\n Castle in the Sky has been generally acclaimed by film critics in the years since its release. In 2001, Animage ranked Castle in the Sky 44th in their list of top 100 anime.[81] Animation critic and writer Raz Greenberg calls Castle in the Sky \"one of the greatest adventure films ever made\",[82] and critic Manabu Murase names it \"quite possibly the most entertaining anime that Miyazaki ever made\".[83] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rate of 96% from 28 critics, with an average rating of 7.6 out of 10. The site\\'s critic consensus reads, \"With a storytelling palette as rich and brilliant as its animation, Castle in the Sky thrillingly encapsulates Studio Ghibli\\'s unique strengths.\"[84] At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on seven critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[85]\\n While multiple reviewers felt that the film\\'s two-hour runtime would turn audiences away,[86] The New York Times\\'s Caryn James commenting that it is \"liable to strain patiences of adults and the attention spans of children\",[87] others argued that the film had the appeal to keep audiences entertained.[88] IGN\\'s Jeremy Conrad felt the characters are \"so likable that you never get bored, you always want to see what adventure is next for them\".[4] Reviewers were split over the 1988 English dub,[89] with the Dayton Daily News\\'s Terry Lawson calling it \"the film\\'s weakest element\",[90] while The Cincinnati Post\\'s David Lyman felt the dubbing into English had been done \"superbly\".[91] The 2003 dub similarly received mixed reviews, with The A.V. Club\\'s Tasha Robinson calling Disney\\'s recordings \"almost comically bland\",[92] and Conrad expressing his appreciation for Anna Paquin as Sheeta and Mark Hamill\\'s performance as Muska.[4] Many critics also praised the animation,[93] the Asheville Times\\'s Tom Sabulis considering it \"state-of-the-art\"[94] and The Philadelphia Inquirer\\'s Steven Rea naming it \"masterful\".[95] However, some felt the motions lacked fluidity,[96] with Lyman describing it as \"stiff-limbed\".[91]\\n Most reviewers highlighted the imaginative capacity that Miyazaki displays in the film.[97] Slant\\'s Chuck Bowen noted the subtle details included in the film, which he felt lends it \"texture and originality\".[98] A review in the Weekly Asahi highlighted the film\\'s dynamism, favorably comparing its flying sequences with Peter Pan (1953).[99] Several reviewers praised the use of color, which made the film \"a joy to watch\" according to James.[100] A reviewer for City Road noted that the film could present themes that were critical of modern society while still maintaining a \"warm and caring\" view of humanity.[101] Several reviewers noted the film\\'s strong ecological theme, with The Washington Post\\'s Richard Harrington appreciating the \"moral duality\" of Laputa\\'s technology,[102] and the Asahi Journal\\'s Yomota Inuhiko praising the depiction of Laputa as a utopia which gradually developed dystopic elements.[103] Critics and scholars also noted the film\\'s connections to Miyazaki\\'s previous works; Greenberg felt that the film is \"deeply rooted within Miyazaki\\'s filmography of the two decades that preceded it\",[40] and Denison called it a \"compendium of Miyazaki\\'s previous interests as an animator\".[104]\\n In a 2006 poll by Japan\\'s Agency for Cultural Affairs conducted at the 2006 Japan Media Arts Festival, the film was rated the third-best animation of all time, after Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995).[105] In a 2008 audience poll conducted by Oricon in Japan, Castle in the Sky was voted the best animation of all time.[106]\\n Castle in the Sky is considered by some scholars and writers to be an important work in the modern steampunk and dieselpunk styles.[111] Along with Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Philip Boyes of Eurogamer considers Castle in the Sky a major contributor to the genres\\' popularity in Japan, introducing audiences to stylistic features such as airships which were otherwise mostly prevalent in Europe.[50] According to McCarthy, \"its mix of epic action-adventure and techno-ecological theme has since earned [Castle in the Sky] cult status.\"[2]\\n Several notable artists in the anime and manga industries have cited Castle in the Sky as a major influence on their works. Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (1990), by Neon Genesis Evangelion director Hideaki Anno, is noted for its similarities in premise with Castle in the Sky. Anno had previously worked with Miyazaki on the production of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, and has stated that Nadia was based in part on one of Miyazaki\\'s concepts.[112] D.Gray-man (2004) author Katsura Hoshino was moved to pursue a career in animation after watching the film, ultimately becoming a manga artist.[113] Ghost in the Shell (1995) director Mamoru Oshii[114] and Your Name (2016) director Makoto Shinkai named Castle in the Sky among their favorite animations.[115] Additionally, VanderMeer and Chambers argue that Castle in the Sky forms the stylistic foundation for several of Miyazaki\\'s later films, including Porco Rosso (1992) and Howl\\'s Moving Castle (2004).[47]\\n John Lasseter, former chief creative officer at Pixar and Disney Animation, often cited Miyazaki and his works to be his \"greatest inspiration\".[116] When asked about some of his favorite films, Lasseter expressed his admiration for Castle in the Sky.[110] Lasseter has worked with Miyazaki on the English dubs of several of his films, and notes this as an influence on his work with his colleagues. At a speech delivered at the 2014 Tokyo International Film Festival, Lasseter said \"Whenever we get stuck at Pixar or Disney, I put on a Miyazaki film sequence or two, just to get us inspired again.\"[117] Napier argues that the protagonist of Pixar\\'s WALL-E (2008), a robot left to care for a world abandoned by humans, \"may have its roots in Laputa\\'s nurturing robot.\"[118]\\n Castle in the Sky has influenced numerous video games, particularly in Japan, with its success leading to a wave of steampunk video games.[50] Game designer Hironobu Sakaguchi cited Castle in the Sky as an inspiration behind his Final Fantasy video game series, particularly citing it as an influence on the series\\' airships.[119] According to Boyes, Castle in the Sky also influenced the airships in the Mario and Civilization franchises.[50] The Iron Golem from Minecraft (2011) takes inspiration from the robots in the film.[120] Several games from The Legend of Zelda series are noted to have been influenced by Castle in the Sky, particularly Tears of the Kingdom (2023), which features a flying castle and several thematic parallels with the film.[121]\\n On December 9, 2011, during an airing of Castle in the Sky on Japanese television, fans posting to Twitter set a new record for the platform by causing a peak of 25,088 tweets per second.[122] The record was later surpassed during another airing on August 2, 2013, with a figure of 143,199 per second.[123]', 'Coraline (/ˈkɒrəlaɪn/)[2] is a 2002 British dark fantasy horror children\\'s novella by author Neil Gaiman. Gaiman started writing Coraline in 1990, and it was published in 2002 by Bloomsbury and HarperCollins. It was awarded the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novella,[3] the 2003 Nebula Award for Best Novel,[4] and the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers.[5] The Guardian ranked Coraline #82 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century.[6] It was adapted as a 2009 stop-motion animated film, directed by Henry Selick under the same name.\\n Coraline Jones and her parents move into an old house that has been divided into flats. The other tenants include Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two elderly women retired from the stage, and Mr. Bobo (commonly referred as the \"Crazy Old Man Upstairs\"), who claims to be training a mouse circus. The flat beside Coraline\\'s, which lies behind a big brown door, remains empty.\\n During a rainy day she discovers the locked door in the living room, which has been bricked up. As she goes to visit her neighbors, Mr. Bobo relates to her a message from the mice: Don\\'t go through the door. At tea with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, Miss Spink senses danger in Coraline’s future after reading her tea leaves and gives her a lucky adder stone. They then explain that it is \"good for bad things\". Despite these warnings, Coraline decides to unlock the door when she is home by herself and finds the brick wall behind the door gone. In its place is a long passageway, which leads to a flat identical to her own, inhabited by her Other Mother and Other Father, who are replicas of her real parents. They have button eyes and exaggerated features. In this “Other World”, Coraline finds everything to be better than her reality: her Other Parents are attentive, her toy box is filled with animate toys that can move and fly, and the Other Miss Spink and Miss Forcible forever perform a cabaret show in their flat. She even finds the feral Black Cat that wanders around the house in the real world can talk, however she learns he is not of the Other World; he only travels from one world to another and warns Coraline of the imminent danger, but Coraline pays him no heed.\\n The Other Mother offers Coraline a chance to stay in the Other World forever, if Coraline will allow buttons to be sewn into her eyes. Coraline is horrified and returns back through the door to go home. Upon her return to her apartment, Coraline finds her real parents are missing. They do not return the next day, and the black cat wakes her and takes her to a mirror in her hallway, through which she can see her trapped parents. They signal to her by writing \"Help Us\" on the glass, from which Coraline deduces the Other Mother has kidnapped them. Though frightened of returning, Coraline goes back to the Other World to confront the Other Mother and rescue her parents. In the garden, Coraline is prompted by the Cat to challenge the Other Mother, as “her kind of thing loves games and challenges”. The Other Mother tries to convince Coraline to stay, but Coraline refuses, and is locked behind a mirror as punishment.\\n In the darkness, she meets three ghost children, each from a different era, who had let the \"Beldam\" (the Other Mother) sew buttons in their eyes. They tell her how she eventually stopped loving them and cast their spirits aside. The ghost children implore Coraline to avoid their fate, and to help find their souls so that they can leave the Other World and pass on. After the Other Mother releases Coraline from the mirror, Coraline proposes a game in which she must find the ghost children’s souls and her parents, which lay hidden throughout the Other World. If Coraline wins, she, her parents and the ghost children may go free. If not, Coraline will let the Other Mother sew the buttons into her eyes.\\n Coraline goes through the Other World, and overcomes all the Other Mother’s obstacles, using her wits and Miss Spink’s stone to locate the ghost children’s souls. At the close of the game, the ghost children warn her even if Coraline wins, the Other Mother will not let them go. Having deduced her parents are imprisoned in the snow globe on the mantle, Coraline tricks the Other Mother by saying her parents are behind the door in the drawing room. As the Other Mother opens the door, Coraline throws the cat at the Other Mother, grabs the snow globe, and escapes to the real world with the key. In doing so, she forces the door shut on the Other Mother\\'s hand, severing it. Back in her home, Coraline finds her parents safe and with no memory of the events.\\n That night, Coraline has a dream in which she meets the three children before they move on to the afterlife. They warn her that her task is still not done: the Other Mother\\'s severed hand is in Coraline\\'s world, attempting to steal the key which opens the door that connects the two worlds. Coraline goes to an old well in the woods by her house, luring the Other Mother’s hand there with the key by pretending to have a picnic with her dolls. By doing so, she casts both down the bottomless well. Coraline returns home, victorious, and prepares to go about the ordinary life she has come to accept and love.\\n A graphic novel adaptation by P. Craig Russell, lettered by Todd Klein and colored by Lovern Kindzierski, was published in 2008.[7]\\n With the help of the animation studio Laika, LLC, director Henry Selick released a stop motion film adaptation in 2009 that received much critical acclaim, and moderate box office success. At the 82nd Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Animated Feature but lost to Pixar\\'s Up. Although the 2009 film has several differences (one example is the Beldam turning the Other Father into a pumpkin), it still manages to hold relatively strong to the original plot of the book. In the film, Coraline is depicted as having short blue hair and freckles. In the movie, there was an added new character named Wyborn \"Wybie\" Lovat, a boy about Coraline\\'s age who frequently annoyed Coraline at first, but over time, they grow on each other. In the Other World, his copy cannot speak but is an ally to Coraline, and gets punished by the Other Mother when he helps Coraline escape the Other World. At the end of the film, Coraline reaches out to help Wybie tell his grandmother what is behind the little door. The sister of Wybie\\'s grandmother was one of the ghost children lost to the Beldam.\\n A theatrical adaptation, with music and lyrics by Stephin Merritt and book by David Greenspan, premiered on 6 May 2009, produced by MCC Theater and True Love Productions Off-Broadway at The Lucille Lortel Theatre.[8] Nine-year-old Coraline was played by an adult, Jayne Houdyshell, and the Other Mother was played by David Greenspan.[8]\\n Another theatrical adaptation, a stage opera by Mark-Anthony Turnage based on the novella, made its world premiere at the Barbican Centre in London on 27 March 2018.\\n On 22 May 2024, it was announced that a new musical adaptation, with music and lyrics by Louis Barabbas and book by Zinnie Harris, would premiere at the Leeds Playhouse on 11 April 2025, before embarking on a tour to the HOME (Manchester), the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, and the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh.[9]\\n A  2009 video game adaptation, based on the film, was published and developed by D3 Publisher of America. The game was released on 27 January 2009 for the PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS and Wii platforms and contains features such as playing as Coraline, interacting with other characters, and playing minigames. The game received mostly negative reviews, and little success.[10][11]\\n Coraline inspired the \"Coralisa\" segment of The Simpsons episode \"Treehouse of Horror XXVIII\", which aired on 22 October 2017.

At the orphanage where she lives, the caretaker known as the Gray One tells scary stories about the evil nature of the bears that live in the outside world, though Celestine doubts that they are entirely true. She loves to draw but must soon study dentistry, since that\\'s what all rodents do, and to prepare, she must travel above ground to collect the lost teeth of a cub from underneath pillows. On one such occasion, the bear family catches Celestine in the act and chases her into a trash can where she is trapped and spends the night. The next morning, a destitute and starving grizzly bear named Ernest discovers Celestine and attempts to eat her.  Celestine convinces him to let her go by helping him break into the basement of a candy shop, where he can eat his fill.  He is soon caught by the store\\'s owner, however, and arrested.  Celestine, who is behind on her quota of collected teeth, agrees to free him from the police wagon if he will help her break into and rob the teeth from the office of the store owner\\'s wife, who happens to be a dentist.\\n Although the robbery initially seems successful, the pair soon find themselves being pursued by the police forces of both the rodent and bear cities.  They manage to evade capture by stealing a van, and escape to Ernest\\'s remote cabin.  Ernest is initially reluctant to allow Celestine to stay with him, but they begin to bond after he discovers her love of art.  He reveals to her that his current destitution is a result of his rejection of his family\\'s plan for him to go into law, like his ancestors, due to his desire to become an entertainer.  The two spend the winter happily together, though their joy is somewhat dampened by the constant radio broadcasts declaring that both police forces are still searching for them as well as how civil unrest has become rampant around both of their homes with the once submissive and complacent poor now rising up against their upper class oppressors.\\n In the Spring, the police are able to track the stolen van to the cabin.  Ernest is arrested by the rodents, while Celestine is arrested by the bears.  Both are simultaneously put on trial, in the main floor and basement of the same courthouse. Though each of them protest their unfair treatment along with the government\\'s bias and prejudice, as well as refusing to sell out their respective companion, the furious judges refuse to listen. Ernest and Celestine then call the judges and the rest of the higher class out on their cruelty to the lower class common folk. During the proceedings, a fire is accidentally started in the courthouse, and while the rest of the citizens flee despite the furious judges\\' demands to stay, Ernest and Celestine each stay behind to rescue their respective judges. The judges are both humiliated and broken that their people, the ones they thought they could always rule, have abandoned them to save their own lives while the ones they sought to wrongfully punish are their saviors. Having truly admitted defeat in their own hearts, the shameful judges drop the charges against them and have no other choice then to grant their wish to be able to remain living together. All the while, the judges express their inability to comprehend the concept of unconditional bonds; and can only watch along with the shaken populace of each place as the courthouses burn to the ground.\\n Reunited in Ernest\\'s cabin, the pair decide to write and illustrate a book, telling the story of their friendship, though with some embellishments after Celestine protests including the part of their meeting where Ernest attempted to eat her.\\n Ernest & Celestine received acclaim from critics.

Paddington station, designed by the engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel opened in 1847. It is also the site of St Mary\\'s Hospital and the former Paddington Green Police Station.\\n Paddington Waterside aims to regenerate former railway and canal land.  Districts within Paddington are Maida Vale, Westbourne and Bayswater including Lancaster Gate.\\n The earliest extant references to Padington (or \"Padintun\", as in the Saxon Chartularies, 959[2]), historically a part of Middlesex, appear in documentation of purported tenth-century land grants to the monks of Westminster by Edgar the Peaceful as confirmed by Archbishop Dunstan. However, the documents\\' provenance is much later and likely to have been forged after the 1066 Norman conquest. There is no mention of the place (or Westbourne or Knightsbridge) in the Domesday Book of 1086.[3]\\n It has been reasonably speculated that a Saxon settlement led by the followers of Padda, an Anglo-Saxon chieftain, was located around the intersection of the northern and western Roman roads, corresponding with the Edgware Road (Watling Street) and the Harrow and Uxbridge Roads.[4][5] From the tenth century, Paddington was owned by Westminster Abbey which was later confirmed by the Plantagenet kings in a charter from 1222. This charter mentions a chapel and a farm situated in the area.[5] While a 12th-century document cited by the cleric Isaac Maddox (1697–1759) establishes that part of the land was held by brothers \"Richard and William de Padinton\".[6] They and their descendants carried out activities in Paddington; these were known by records dating from 1168 to 1485. They were the earliest known tenant farmers of the land.[5]\\n During King Henry VIII\\'s dissolution, the property of Paddington was seized by the crown. However, King Edward VI granted the land to the Bishop of London in 1550. Successive bishops would later lease farmlands to tenants and city merchants. One such, in the 1540s was Thomas North who translated Plutarch\\'s Parallel Lives into English in 1579. Shakespeare would later use this work and was said to have performed in taverns along Edgware Road.[5]\\n In the later Elizabethan and early Stuart era, the rectory, manor and associated estate houses were occupied by the Small (or Smale) family. Nicholas Small was a clothworker who was sufficiently well connected to have Holbein paint a portrait of his wife, Jane Small. Nicholas died in 1565 and his wife married again, to Nicholas Parkinson of Paddington who became master of the Clothworkers\\' Company. Jane Small continued to live in Paddington after her second husband\\'s death, and her manor house was big enough to have been let to Sir John Popham, the attorney general, in the 1580s. They let the building that became in this time Blowers Inn.[7]\\n As the regional population grew in the 17th century, Paddington\\'s ancient Hundred of Ossulstone was split into divisions; Holborn Division replaced the hundred for most administrative purposes.[8] A church, the predecessor of St Mary was built in Paddington in 1679.[9]\\n In 1740, John Frederick leased the estate in Paddington and it is from his granddaughters and their families that many of Paddington\\'s street names are derived.[5] The New Road was built in 1756–7 to link the villages of Paddington and Islington.[10]:\\u200a260\\u200a By 1773, a contemporary historian felt and wrote that \"London may now be said to include two cities (London and Westminster), one borough (Southwark) and forty six antient [ancient] villages [among which]... Paddington and [adjoining] Marybone (Marylebone).\"[9]\\nDuring the 18th century, several French Huguenots called Paddington village home. These included jewellers, nobility and skilled craftsmen; and men such as Claudius Amyand (surgeon to King George II). The French nobility built magnificent gardens that lasted up until the 19th century.[5]\\n \\nRoman roads formed the parish\\'s northeastern and southern boundaries from Marble Arch: Watling Street (later Edgware Road) and; (the) Uxbridge road, known by the 1860s in this neighbourhood as Bayswater Road. They were toll roads in much of the 18th century, before and after the dismantling of the permanent Tyburn gallows \"tree\" at their junction in 1759 a junction now known as Marble Arch.[11]:\\u200ap.174\\u200a The Tyburn gallows might have been a reason why expansion and urban development (from London) slowed in Paddington; as public execution was taking place there up until 1783.[5] Only in 1801 did major construction to Paddington occur. This happened when the bishops leased land to the Grand Junction Canal, where a direct trade link could now take place between London and the Midlands, bringing more employment to the area. The canal would remain dominant until Regent\\'s Canal was built in 1820. Construction and building projects would take place from east to west and south to north throughout the 19th century; increasing its population in a rapid pace, overtaking the village scene of Paddington. This population increase would go from 1,881 to 46,305 between 1801 and 1851 respectively; with 10,000 new inhabitants added every decade thereafter.[5]\\n Paddington station first opened in 1838, with the first underground line in 1863 (Metropolitan).[5] Paddington was one of the few districts in London that had a migrant majority population by 1881.[10]:\\u200a416\\u200a With a thriving Greek and Jewish community present in the mid-19th century. During the period, several Victorian churches were demolished owing to structural decay. Victorian housing developed into slums, giving the area an unsavoury reputation.\\n However, in the 1930s massive rebuilding and improvements projects were made. However, even as late as the 1950s Paddington was a byword for overcrowding, poverty and vice. Between the 1960s and 1980s, the area would see vast improvements and redevelopments in city planning.[5]\\n The southeast section of Tyburnia used to be a shanty-town in the 1790s before the Canal was built and brought much needed employment to its inhabitants. The area was built up during the course of the Napoleonic Wars.[5]\\n In the 19th century the part of the parish most sandwiched between Edgware Road and Westbourne Terrace, Gloucester Terrace and Craven Hill, bounded to the south by Bayswater Road, was known as Tyburnia. The district formed the centrepiece of an 1824 masterplan by Samuel Pepys Cockerell to redevelop the Tyburn Estate (historic lands of the Bishop of London) into a residential area to rival Belgravia.[12]\\n The area was laid out in the mid-1800s when grand squares and cream-stuccoed terraces started to fill the acres between Paddington station and Hyde Park; however, the plans were never realised in full. Despite this, Thackeray described the residential district of Tyburnia as \"the elegant, the prosperous, the polite Tyburnia, the most respectable district of the habitable globe.\"[13]\\n Derivation of the name is uncertain. Speculative explanations include Padre-ing-tun (explained as \"father\\'s meadow village\"), Pad-ing-tun (\"pack-horse meadow village\"),[14] and Pæding-tun (\"village of the race of Pæd\")[15] the last being the cited suggestion of the Victorian Anglo-Saxon scholar John Mitchell Kemble.\\n There is another Paddington in Surrey, recorded in the Domesday Book as \"Padendene\"[16] and later as \"Paddingdon\", perhaps to be derived from Old English dene, denu \"valley\", whereas Paddington in Middlesex is commonly traced back to Old English tūn \"farm, homestead, town\". Both place names share the same first part, a personal name rendered as Pad(d)a, of uncertain origin, giving \"Padda\\'s valley\" for the place in Surrey and \"homestead of Padda\\'s people\" for the place in Middlesex.[2] That both place names would refer to the same individual or ancient family,[17] is pure speculation. A lord named Padda is named in the Domesday Book, associated with Brampton, Suffolk.[18]\\n An 18th-century dictionary gives \"Paddington Fair Day. An execution day, Tyburn being in the parish or neighbourhood of Paddington. To dance the Paddington frisk; to be hanged.\"[19] Public executions were abolished in England in 1868.[20]\\n The Paddington district is centred around Paddington railway station.  The conventional recognised boundary of the district is much smaller than the longstanding pre-mid-19th century parish. That parish was virtually equal to the borough abolished in 1965.  It is divided from a northern offshoot Maida Vale by the Regent\\'s Canal; its overlap is the artisan and touristic neighbourhood of Little Venice.  In the east of the district around Paddington Green it remains divided from Marylebone by Edgware Road (as commonly heard in spoken form, the Edgware Road).  In the south west it is bounded by its south and western offshoot Bayswater.  A final offshoot, Westbourne, rises to the north west.\\n Paddington was part of the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington, the headquarters of which was at Paddington Town Hall, until 1965 when the area became part of the enlarged City of Westminster.[21]\\n A lagoon created in the 1810s at the convergence of the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal, the Regent\\'s Canal and the Paddington Basin.  It is an important focal point of the Little Venice area.  It is reputedly named after Robert Browning, the poet.  More recently known as the \"Little Venice Lagoon\" it contains a small islet known as Browning\\'s Island.  Although Browning was thought to have coined the name \"Little Venice\" for this spot there are strong arguments Lord Byron was responsible.[22]\\n Paddington station is the iconic landmark associated with the area.  In the station are statues of its designer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and the children\\'s fiction character Paddington Bear.\\n The terminus of the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal was originally known as the Paddington Basin and all the land to the south was developed into housing and commercial property and titled The Grand Junction Estate. The majority of the housing was bounded by Praed Street, Sussex Gardens, Edgware Road and Norfolk Place. Land and buildings not used for the canal undertaking remained after 1929 with the renamed Grand Junction Company, which functioned as a property company. While retaining its own name, it was taken over in 1972 by the Amalgamated Investment and Property Company, which went into liquidation in 1976. Prior to the liquidation the Welbeck Estate Securities Group acquired the entire estate comprising 525 houses 15 shops and the Royal Exchange public House in Sale Place.\\n The surrounding area is now known as Merchant Square. A former transshipment facility, the surrounds of the canal basin named Merchant Square have been redeveloped to provide 2,000,000\\xa0sq\\xa0ft (190,000\\xa0m2) of offices, homes, shops and leisure facilities.[23] The redeveloped basin has some innovative features including Heatherwicks Rolling Bridge, the Merchant Square Fan Bridge and the Floating Pocket Park.[24]\\n Situated to the north of the railway as it enters Paddington station, and to the south of the Westway flyover and with the canal to the east the former railway goods yard has been developed into a modern complex with wellbeing, leisure, retail and leisure facilities.[25] The public area from the canal to Sheldon Square with the amphitheatre hosts leisure facilities and special events.[26]\\n A green space and conservation area in the east of the Paddington district immediately to the north of the Westway and west of Edgware Road.  It includes St Mary on Paddington Green Church.  The Paddington Green campus of the City of Westminster College is adjacent to the Green.  Paddington Green Police Station is immediately to the north west of the intersection of Westway and Edgware Road.\\n Paddington station is on the London Underground and National Rail networks. It is in London fare zone 1.[27]\\n Great Western Railway services from Paddington run towards Slough, Maidenhead and Reading, with intercity services continuing towards destinations in South West England and South Wales, including Oxford, Worcester, Bristol, Cardiff, Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance.[28]\\n The Elizabeth line, operated by Transport for London (TfL), runs a stopping service from Paddington to Reading, either as part of through-running services from the central and eastern parts of the Elizabeth line or starting from Paddington. These trains mostly depart from the deep-level Elizabeth line platforms underneath the western side of the mainline station. These deep-level Elizabeth line tracks emerge above ground adjacent to the mainline tracks just west of Royal Oak tube station and join them at that point, thereafter sharing the relief line tracks with some Great Western Railway stopping services as far as the Elizabeth line terminus at Reading. Elizabeth line services link the Paddington area both to destinations in west London and Berkshire and to the centre and eastern side of London.\\n Trains to Heathrow Airport also depart from Paddington, operated both by the Elizabeth line (stopping services via Ealing Broadway) and the Heathrow Express (no intermediate stops).[27][28]\\n There are two London Underground (tube) stations in the Paddington station complex.\\n The Bakerloo, Circle and District lines call at the station on Praed Street (which, from the main concourse, is opposite platform 3). This links Paddington directly to destinations across Central and West London, including Baker Street, Earl\\'s Court, Oxford Circus, South Kensington, Victoria, Waterloo, Westminster and Wimbledon.[27]\\n The Circle and Hammersmith & City lines call at the station near the Paddington Basin (to the north of platform 12). Trains from this station link the area directly to Hammersmith via Shepherd\\'s Bush to the west. Eastbound trains pass through Baker Street, King\\'s Cross St Pancras, Liverpool Street in the City, Whitechapel and Barking.[27]\\n Lancaster Gate tube station is also in the area, served by Central line trains.[27]\\n Paddington station was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The permanent building opened in 1854.\\n Paddington Bear was also named after the station; in Michael Bond\\'s 1958 book A Bear Called Paddington, Paddington is found at the station by the Brown family. He is lost, having just arrived in London from \"darkest Peru.\"\\n London Buses 7, 23, 27, 36, 46, 205 and 332, and night buses N7 and N205 serve Paddington station. Buses 23, 27 and 36 operate 24 hours, daily.[29]\\n Routes 94 and 148 serve Lancaster Gate station to the south of Paddington. Both routes operate 24 hours, daily, supplemented by route N207 at nights.[30]\\n Several key routes pass through or around the Paddington area, including:\\n Cycling infrastructure is provided in Paddington by Transport for London (TfL) and the Canal & River Trust.\\n Several cycle routes pass through the area, including:\\n Sustrans also propose that National Cycle Route 6 (NCR 6) will begin at Paddington and run northwest along the Grand Union Canal towpath. The route, when complete, will run signposted and unbroken to Keswick, Cumbria. Within the M25, the route will pass through Hayes, Uxbridge and Watford.[34]\\n Santander Cycles, a London-wide bike sharing system, operates in Paddington, with several docking stations in the area.[35]\\n The Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal runs from Paddington to Hayes, via Westbourne Park and Willesden. Beyond Hayes, onward destinations include Slough, the Colne Valley, and Aylesbury. The Paddington Basin is in the area, as is Little Venice. A towpath runs unbroken from Paddington to Hayes.[36]\\n The Rolling Bridge at the Paddington Basin was designed by Thomas Heatherwick, who wanted to create a bridge that, instead of breaking apart to let boats through, would \"get out of the way\" instead. Heatherwick\\'s website cites the  \"fluid, coiling tails of the animatronic dinosaurs of Jurassic Park\" as the initial influence behind the Bridge.[37]\\n The Regent\\'s Canal begins at Little Venice, heading east towards Maida Vale, Regent\\'s Park, Camden Town, King\\'s Cross, Old Street and Mile End en route to Limehouse. A towpath runs along the canal from Paddington to Limehouse, broken only by the Maida Hill and Islington tunnels.[38]\\n Commercial traffic on the Grand Junction Canal (which became the Grand Union Canal in 1929) dwindled because of railway competition in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, and freight then moved from rail to road after World War II, leading to the abandonment of the goods yards in the early 1980s. The land lay derelict until the Paddington Waterside Partnership was established in 1998 to co-ordinate the regeneration of the area between the Westway, Praed Street and Westbourne Terrace. This includes major developments on the goods yard site (now branded Paddington Central) and around the canal (Paddington Basin).  As of October 2017[update] much of these developments have been completed and are in use.[39]\\n PaddingtonNow BID put forward a renewal bid in 2017 covering the period April 2018 to March 2023, which would be supported by a levy on local businesses. Development schemes for St. Mary\\'s Hospital and Paddington Square are likely to commence in this period, and the impact of the opening of the Elizabeth line in 2018 would be soon felt.[39]\\n Paddington has a number of Anglican churches, including St James\\'s, St Mary Magdalene, St David\\'s Welsh Church and St Peter\\'s. In addition, there is a large Muslim population in and around Paddington.\\n Between 1805 and 1817, the great actress Sarah Siddons lived at Desborough House,[42] (which was demolished before 1853 to make way for the Great Western Railway) and was buried at Paddington Green, near the later graves of the eminent painters Benjamin Haydon and William Collins.[43]:\\u200ap.183\\u200a Her brother Charles Kemble also built a house, Desborough Lodge, in the vicinity—in which she may have lived later.[11]:\\u200ap.230\\u200a In later years, the actress Yootha Joyce, best known for her part in the classic television comedy George and Mildred, lived at 198 Sussex Gardens.[44]\\n One of Napoleon\\'s nephews, Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte (1813–1891), a notable comparative linguist and dialectologist, who spent most of his adult life in England, had a house in Norfolk Terrace, Westbourne Park.[11]:\\u200ap.200\\u200a\\n The eccentric philanthropist Ann Thwaytes lived at 17 Hyde Park Gardens between 1840 and 1866.[45][46]\\n The Victorian poet Robert Browning moved from No. 1 Chichester Road to Beauchamp Lodge, 19 Warwick Crescent, in 1862 and lived there until 1887.[11]:\\u200app.199\\u200a  He is reputed to have named that locality, on the junction of two canals, \"Little Venice\". But this has been disputed by Lord Kinross in 1966[47][22] and more recently by londoncanals.uk[48] who both assert that Lord Byron humorously coined the name. The name is now applied, more loosely, to a longer reach of the canal system.\\n St Mary\\'s Hospital in Praed Street is the site of several notable medical accomplishments. In 1874, C. R. Alder Wright synthesised heroin (diacetylmorphine). Also there, in 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming first isolated penicillin, earning the award of a Nobel Prize. The hospital has an Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum[49] where visitors can see Fleming\\'s laboratory, restored to its 1928 condition, and explore the story of Fleming and the discovery and development of penicillin through displays and video.\\n Edward Wilson, physician, naturalist and ornithologist, who died in 1912 on Captain Robert Scott\\'s ill-fated British Antarctic expedition, had earlier practised as a doctor in Paddington. The former Senior Street primary school was renamed the Edward Wilson School after him in 1951.[11]:\\u200app.266\\u200a\\n British painter Lucian Freud had his studio in Paddington, first at Delamere Terrace from 1943 to 1962, and then at 124 Clarendon Crescent from 1962 to 1977.[50]\\n Timothy Forsyte of John Galsworthy\\'s The Forsyte Saga and other relatives resided in Bayswater Road.[51]\\n Paddington Bear, from \"deepest, darkest Peru\", emigrated to England via Paddington station.[52]', 'The Gruffalo is a British children\\'s picture book by author Julia Donaldson and illustrated by Axel Scheffler. It tells the story of a mouse taking a walk in the woods and deceiving different predators, including the Gruffalo. The Gruffalo was first published in 1999 in the United Kingdom by Macmillan Children\\'s Books. It is about 700 words long and is written in rhyming couplets featuring repetitive verse. It is an example of a trickster story and was inspired by a Chinese folk tale called \"The Fox that Borrows the Terror of a Tiger\". The Gruffalo has sold over 13.5 million copies and has won several prizes for children\\'s literature including the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize. \\n It has been adapted into plays and an Oscar-nominated animated film. The book has inspired a range of merchandise, a commemorative coin, a theme park ride in Chessington World of Adventures, and a series of woodland trails. In 2004, The Gruffalo was followed by a sequel—The Gruffalo\\'s Child—also written by Donaldson and illustrated by Scheffler.\\n Julia Donaldson is an author of children\\'s books, the most famous of which being The Gruffalo.[1] Before writing The Gruffalo, Donaldson had a background in drama and performance.[2] She studied drama at the University of Bristol and then busked in Europe and the United States.[1] She began her career as a writer by writing children\\'s songs for television programmes. In 1993, one of her songs that she sang and performed with her husband—\"A Squash and Squeeze\", about an elderly lady with a small house[3]—was turned into a book, published by Methuen and illustrated by Axel Scheffler.[4][5] Scheffler was born and grew up in Germany before moving to the UK to study art. He first worked with Donaldson on A Squash and Squeeze, published in 1993.[3]\\n In an interview in the book The Way We Write (2006), Donaldson writes that although \"It can take months or years for the germination of a book ... writing The Gruffalo probably took two weeks, with all the rewriting\".[6] She said that writing the second half of the book was difficult and almost forced her to stop altogether.[7] Donaldson said that she had admired Scheffler\\'s illustrations for A Squash and Squeeze, and when her publisher did not suggest he would also be illustrating The Gruffalo, she sent him the text of the book herself. Scheffler showed the text to Macmillan, who were his publisher at the time and subsequently published the book.[8]\\n A mouse walks through a wood and encounters three predators—first a fox, then an owl, & finally a snake. Each of these animals invites the mouse into their home for a meal, the implication being that they intend to eat the mouse. The mouse declines each offer, telling the predators that it plans to dine with a \"gruffalo\". The mouse then describes the gruffalo\\'s frightening features, such as \"terrible tusks, terrible claws, and terrible teeth in his terrible jaws\".[9] The mouse tells each predator that the predator is the gruffalo\\'s favourite food. Frightened that the gruffalo might eat them, each animal flees. Convinced the Gruffalo is fictional, the mouse says:\\n After getting rid of the snake, the mouse is shocked to encounter a real Gruffalo, which has all the features the mouse thought that it was inventing. The Gruffalo threatens to eat the mouse. Instead, the mouse insists that the mouse is the scariest animal in the wood. Laughing, the Gruffalo agrees to follow the mouse. The two walk through the wood, encountering each of the three predators again. Each predator is terrified by the sight of the Gruffalo and escapes to its home, but the Gruffalo believes that they are actually scared of the mouse. Exploiting this, the mouse threatens to eat the Gruffalo in a “Gruffalo crumble”. The Gruffalo flees, leaving the mouse to eat a nut in peace.\\n In an article titled \"Humour and the locus of control in \\'The Gruffalo\\'\", Betsie van der Westhuizen identifies the following types of humour used in The Gruffalo: \"humour with regard to the narrative aspects, humour with regard to the poetic aspects, visual humour and humour and the performing arts\".[10] She writes that the most common use of humour in the story is incongruity, arising from the sense that \"everything is not as it should be\".[11] Some examples include the mouse averting the predators and the unusual descriptions of food, such as \"owl ice cream\" and \"scrambled snake\".[12] She writes that there are different experiences of humour among different ages of children who read The Gruffalo: three to five year olds will appreciate the elements of surprise and repetition in the story; six to eight year olds will enjoy the rhyme and rhythm of the text and the story\\'s hyperbole.[10] As for visual representations of humour, van der Westhuizen writes that an example occurs when the mouse scares away the snake, accompanied by fragmented images of the imaginary gruffalo\\'s features, then immediately afterwards comes across the real Gruffalo.[13]\\n Mice often feature as the main character in stories for children, and one key characteristic of the animal in this context is humour.[14][10] Both Ghassan Fadhil Radhi and van der Westhuizen write that children relate to the character of the mouse who triumphs in difficult situations, along with the humour that is a key element of many mouse stories.[10][14]\\n Donaldson has said that the story of The Gruffalo was inspired by a Chinese folk tale known as \"The Fox that Borrows the Terror of a Tiger\"[15][16] (狐假虎威[17]). The folk tale is about a hungry tiger who tries to catch a fox. The fox is clever and tells the tiger that God has made the fox king of all animals. Whilst accompanying the fox, the tiger notices that other animals run away in fear. Not realising that they are actually running away from the tiger, the tiger believes that fox is indeed a feared king.[16] Donaldson was originally going to have the beast in her book be a tiger, but was unable to think of rhymes for \"tiger\" so instead invented a new word—\"gruffalo\".[16]\\n The Taiwanese translator of The Gruffalo recommended the book for publication in Taiwanese because he noticed the story bore resemblance to the traditional tale. Teachers have used this translated book to demonstrate a modern retelling of the Chinese folk tale. In an article on the traditional Chinese translation of The Gruffalo in Taiwan, Chen-Wei Yu writes that the \"resourcefulness\" of the mouse in Donaldson\\'s story represents a Western association with \"individual autonomy\" and \"self-achievement\", whereas the fox in the original fable is to be looked down upon because it does not accept its correct place in society nor an individual\\'s obligation to others.[16] This latter interpretation of the story has led the phrase \"The Fox that Borrows the Terror of a Tiger\" to mean someone who makes use of another person\\'s power for their own gain.[16]\\n The Gruffalo is a short children\\'s story around 700 words long.[18] It is intended to be read aloud as it is written for a target audience of children who do not know or are learning how to read.[19] It is written in rhyming couplets in primarily dactylic tetrameter. This is a relatively uncommon metre, consisting of one stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables, for instance:[20]\\n The rhythm of the text is broken at key points in the story. For example, when the mouse announces that he is going to meet the gruffalo \"here, by the rocks\", the pause on the word \"here\" lets the reader know the importance of the location and makes them more likely to remember it when the mouse and Gruffalo return there later in the story.[21] The rhythm is broken again after the mouse fools the predators and sees the Gruffalo for the first time, saying \"Oh, help! Oh, no! It\\'s a gruffalo\".[22]\\n To create a satisfying rhyming scheme for the story, Donaldson tried a few different names for the creature that would eventually become the Gruffalo.[23]\\n So I had my plot, but I couldn\\'t get any good couplet, like \\'Silly old fox! You ought to know, you really should, / There aren\\'t any tigers in this wood.\\' Something like that just didn\\'t seem very strong. So then I thought if the mouse were going to meet some made-up creature, it would be much easier for me to write about it. I have just looked at my notes, and see that at first I thought the creature could be a \\'snargle\\' or \\'stroog\\' or \\'tiglophant\\' (I must have been thinking at one stage of having it a cross between a tiger and an elephant). Then I finally thought of the lines, \\'Silly old fox! Doesn\\'t he know, / There\\'s no such thing as a gruffalo?\\' I thought the word had to have three syllables, and end in \\'o\\', and would sound fierce with \\'gr\\' at the beginning, so gruffalo came. In Burke\\'s view, the name is \"fittingly crafted by the author\".[24] The use of the Gr sound at the start of the name evokes negativity, harshness and discomfort, as it is a common consonant cluster in words with that connotation (for example: growl, groan, grumble). The first syllable in the name—gruff—is shared with the other children\\'s literary characters of the Three Billy Goats Gruff.[24] The sound of the word \"Gruffalo\" is used to emphasise the first time the Gruffalo is seen in the story: the mouse begins saying the sentence \"Silly old snake, doesn\\'t he know, there\\'s no such thing as a Gruffal ...\", then the reader turns the page to see the picture of the Gruffalo and the mouse finishes its sentence with the exclamation \"Oh!\". Burke writes that this exclamation works particularly well when the text is read out loud.[25] Van der Westhuizen writes that there is some \"very subtle wordplay/manipulation of spelling\" when the real Gruffalo is first introduced to make him \"more specific, more substantial\": from that point on in the text, \"Gruffalo\" is spelled with a capital \\'G\\'; up until in the story, it was spelled with a lower case \\'g\\'.[26] There is typographic variation in the text, in that the Gruffalo\\'s and predator\\'s dialogue is written in italic font whereas the mouse\\'s dialogue is not.[27]\\n The text contains a mixture of predictable rhymes (such as mouse-house and wood-good) and unpredictable rhymes (such as toowhoo-flew). It utilises alliteration from the very start (such as \"deep, dark woods\" in the opening line), which gives more emphasis to the descriptions and helps children remember them easier.[15][22] The word \"terrible\" is repeated as an adjective to describe the Gruffalo\\'s features (for example \"terrible tusks\", \"terrible claws\"), which Burke writes may remind readers of Where the Wild Things Are—another children\\'s book to use the word.[28] The Gruffalo mainly uses concrete nouns (such as \"lake\" and \"wood\") rather than abstract nouns.[15]\\n When writing the story, Donaldson did not have an exact vision of what the Gruffalo would look like. She said that she imagined he would be \"more weird and less furry\" than Scheffler\\'s final illustrations.[29] She read the story in schools prior to the book being published and invited the children to draw the Gruffalo, which resulted in creatures which she described as looking \"more like aliens and less like cuddly animals\".[29] In early sketches for the book, the Gruffalo was depicted as being humanoid, troll-like, and wearing a T-shirt and trousers. The book\\'s editor, Alison Green, said that they instead decided that the Gruffalo would look more like a woodland creature and predator, and Donaldson said the resulting illustration is \"more natural looking\".[29][30] Scheffler\\'s depiction of the creature relied on the physical descriptions within the text along with features which aren\\'t mentioned, such as a pair of bovine horns. He created a version of the character which is cuddly and furry but still scary.[31] Donaldson describes the Gruffalo\\'s appearance as a \"mixture of scary but stupid\".[30] Burke writes that the image of the Gruffalo has become \"iconic\".[19]\\n When the Gruffalo first appears in the story, he takes up a large part of the visual space on the page with strong, contrasting colours.[32] He appears menacing with his arms raised in an attack stance, claws extended, and a drooling tongue.[25] The mouse in comparison looks threatened,[32] but the humorous grin of the Gruffalo—who looks directly at the audience rather than the mouse—alongside the playfulness of the text implies that the creature is less scary than he appears.[33] As the story progresses, the Gruffalo gradually appears less menacing and more frightened. Throughout the nine visual depictions of the Gruffalo in the book, he becomes, as Burke writes, more \"buffoon-like\".[34] In the penultimate picture of the Gruffalo, he holds his hand to his neck area which makes him look uncomfortable. The final picture is of the Gruffalo is him running away.[34]\\n The Gruffalo is set in a forest. Scheffler was inspired by the forests in Hamburg when drawing rough initial sketches for the book.[31] The setting contains a footpath, stream, lake, mushrooms and other wildlife.[35] He depicts the \"deep dark wood\" with deep green and brown tones and dark outlines.[31] The darkness of the hues add to the feeling of suspense when reading the story.[36] Burke writes that the trees and tree roots are \"reminiscent of the Gruffalo itself, it is as if the forest has in part spawned the creature, and they serve in the story to foreshadow what is to come\".[19] Throughout the book, the setting doesn\\'t change—the illustrations at the end of the book are a mirror image of the forest at the beginning.[35]\\n The Gruffalo was published by Macmillan in 1999—a year after its completion.[37] An audiobook version, narrated by Imelda Staunton, was released in 2002[38] and a jigsaw book version was published in 2004.[39] The \"Gruffalo song\" was released with the audiobook on a musical CD with other songs from Donaldson\\'s books.[40] Scheffler and Donaldson continued to work together in an author-illustrator partnership and as of 2022 have created over 20 best-selling books.[18] In 2019, 20 years after the publication of The Gruffalo, over 13.5 million copies had been sold.[41] It has been translated into more than 100 languages,[1] including Cornish,[42] multiple dialects of Scots[43][44] and Latin.[45] The sequel to the book by Donaldson and Scheffler—The Gruffalo\\'s Child—was published in 2004.[46] It tells the story of the Gruffalo\\'s daughter discovering the mouse after hearing stories about it from her father.[47] Allusions to the Gruffalo character appear in several other books by Donaldson and Scheffler.[48]\\n The book has been adapted into a 30 minute animated film,[49] which was broadcast on BBC One in the UK on 25 December 2009.[50] This version features Robbie Coltrane in the title role, James Corden as the mouse, Helena Bonham Carter as the mother squirrel narrator, John Hurt as the Owl, Tom Wilkinson as the Fox and Rob Brydon as the Snake.[51] The production was animated at Studio Soi in Germany[52] and produced through Magic Light Pictures.[53] It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Short Film (Animated) in 2011.[54] The film was nominated for a BAFTA in 2010.[55]\\n The Gruffalo has been adapted for the stage by Tall Stories theatre company, premiering in 2001. The production has toured the West End, Broadway, and Sydney Opera House.[56] A review in The Scotsman says that the play \"develops Donaldson\\'s words with perfect understanding\".[57] A review in British Theatre praises the \"dynamic movements in all the scenes\", including fourth wall breaks, but writes that the musical numbers and scenery are not as inspiring.[58] The Gruffalo has also been adapted for the stage by Dutch theatre company Meneer Monster.[59]\\n A range of official The Gruffalo merchandise includes clothing, accessories, games, and soft toys.[60] A Gruffalo Woodland Trail was opened on 31 March 2012 at the Dean Heritage Centre in the Forest of Dean. The trail depicts scenes and characters from the book carved by chainsaw artists.[61] Other Gruffalo-themed woodland walks and trails have been established in Great Britain, including those at Kilmardinny Loch in Bearsden,[62] Mount Vernon Park in Glasgow,[63] Ardkinglas in Argyll,[64] Whinlatter Forest Park in Cumbria,[65] and several locations managed by Forestry England.[66] In 2017, Chessington World of Adventures opened The Gruffalo River Ride Adventure after securing a licensing deal with the studio Magic Light Pictures, which created The Gruffalo film. This ride replaced the park\\'s Bubbleworks Ride.[67] Another ride based on Donaldson\\'s book, and Magic Light Picture\\'s film, Room on the Broom was also opened.[68]\\n Sterling silver, gold, and UK 50p commemorative coins featuring \"The Gruffalo\" were issued in 2019 to mark the 20th anniversary of the book\\'s publication. The coins were not introduced into general circulation, but were sold through the Royal Mint website. The 50p coins sold out within a day of being released.[69] The same year, characters from the book featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail.[70]\\n The Gruffalo won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize and Blue Peter Book Award\\'s Best Book to Read Aloud.[71] In November 2009 the book was voted \"best bedtime story\" by listeners of BBC Radio 2.[72] In a 2010 survey by UK charity Booktime, the book came first in a list of children\\'s favourite books.[73]', 'Where the Wild Things Are is a 1963 children\\'s picture book written and illustrated by American author and illustrator, Maurice Sendak, originally published in hardcover by Harper & Row. The book has been adapted into other media several times, including an animated short film in 1973 (with an updated version in 1988); a 1980 opera; and a live-action 2009 feature-film adaptation. The book had sold over 19 million copies worldwide as of 2009, with 10 million of those being in the United States.[3]\\n Sendak won the annual Caldecott Medal from the children\\'s librarians in 1964, recognizing Wild Things as the previous year\\'s \"most distinguished American picture book for children\".[4] It was voted the number one picture book in a 2012 survey of School Library Journal readers, not for the first time.[5]\\n The story focuses on a young boy named Max who, after dressing in his wolf suit, wreaks such havoc through his household that he is sent to bed without his supper. Max\\'s bedroom undergoes a mysterious transformation into a jungle environment, and he winds up sailing to an island inhabited by monsters, simply called the Wild Things. The Wild Things try to scare Max, but to no avail. After stopping and intimidating the creatures, Max is hailed as the king of the Wild Things and enjoys a playful romp with his subjects. Finally, he stops them and sends them to bed without their supper. However, to the Wild Things\\' dismay, he starts to feel lonely and decides to abdicate and return home. The creatures do not want him to go and throw themselves into fits of rage as Max calmly sails away home. Upon returning to his bedroom, Max discovers a hot supper waiting for him.\\n Sendak began his career as an illustrator, but by the mid-1950s he had decided to start both writing and illustrating his own books.[6] In 1956, he published his first book for which he was the sole author, Kenny\\'s Window (1956). Soon after, he began work on another solo effort. The story was supposed to be that of a child who, after a tantrum, is punished in his room and decides to escape to the place that gives the book its title, the \"land of wild horses\".[6] Shortly before starting the illustrations, Sendak realized he did not know how to draw horses and, at the suggestion of his editor, changed the wild horses to the more ambiguous \"Wild Things\", a term inspired by the Yiddish expression \"vilde chaya\" (\"wild animals\"), used to indicate boisterous children.[7]\\n He replaced the horses with caricatures of his aunts and uncles, caricatures that he had originally drawn in his youth as an escape from their chaotic weekly visits, on Sunday afternoons, to his family\\'s Brooklyn home. Sendak, as a child, had observed his relatives as being \"all crazy – crazy faces and wild eyes\", with blood-stained eyes and \"big and yellow\" teeth, who pinched his cheeks until they were red.[6][8][9] These relatives, like Sendak\\'s parents, were poor Jewish immigrants from Poland, whose remaining family in Nazi-occupied Europe were killed during the Holocaust while Sendak was in his early teens. As a child, however, he saw them only as \"grotesques\".[9][10]\\n When working on the 1983 opera adaptation of the book with Oliver Knussen, Sendak gave the monsters the names of his relatives: Tzippy, Moishe, Aaron, Emile, and Bernard.[11]\\n In Selma G. Lanes\\'s book The Art of Maurice Sendak, Sendak discusses Where the Wild Things Are along with his other books In the Night Kitchen and Outside Over There as a trilogy centered on children\\'s growth, survival, and fury.[12][13] He indicated that the three books are \"all variations on the same theme: how children master various feelings – danger, boredom, fear, frustration, jealousy – and manage to come to grips with the realities of their lives\".[12] Fundamental to Sendak\\'s work for over fifty years is his trust in the validity of children\\'s emotions.[14]\\n Dr. Kara Keeling and Dr. Scott Pollard, both English professors, assess the role that food plays in the book, arguing that food is a metaphor for Max\\'s mother\\'s love based on the idea that Max comes home to a \"still hot\" supper, which suggests that his mother \"loves him best\".[15] Going along with this, Mary Pols of Time magazine wrote that \"[w]hat makes Sendak\\'s book so compelling is its grounding effect: Max has a tantrum and in a flight of fancy visits his wild side, but he is pulled back by a belief in parental love to a supper \\'still hot\\', balancing the seesaw of fear and comfort\".[16]\\n Where the Wild Things Are is a story that shows children\\'s resilience through their \"spirit\" and \"pluck\".[17] Max is able to stand up to the Wild Things with their \"terrible teeth\" and \"terrible claws\" using \"the magic trick of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once\".[17]\\n Professor Liam Heneghan describes Max\\'s dream as one of mastering the wild, from which he also learns to master his \"inner tumult\".[18] It sets forth the unrestrained rowdiness of the Wild Things and enlightens the reader to the idea that one cannot live in the wild forever. In her words: \"In this notion of wilderness, there is a heightened reminder that after our fill of wilderness, one can, or perhaps even should, return, replenished, to the comforts of home\".[18] Heneghan concludes that \"the overarching thought is an old one: a human engages with Wild Things and in so doing comes into accord with the world and gains a measure of self-mastery\".[18]\\n Where the Wild Things Are has received high critical acclaim. Francis Spufford suggests that the book is \"one of the very few picture books to make an entirely deliberate and beautiful use of the psychoanalytic story of anger\".[19] New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis noted that \"there are different ways to read the wild things, through a Freudian or colonialist prism, and probably as many ways to ruin this delicate story of a solitary child liberated by his imagination\".[20] Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \"Teachers\\' Top 100 Books for Children\".[21] Five years later, School Library Journal sponsored a survey of readers which identified Where the Wild Things Are as a top picture book.[5] Elizabeth Bird, the librarian from the New York Public Library who conducted the survey, observed that there was little doubt that it would be voted number one and highlighted its designation by one reader as a watershed, \"ushering in the modern age of picture books\". Another critic called it \"perfectly crafted, perfectly illustrated ... simply the epitome of a picture book\" and noted that Sendak \"rises above the rest in part because he is subversive\". President Barack Obama read it aloud for children who were attending the White House Easter Egg Roll in multiple years.[22]\\n New York Times writer Bruce Handy brought up the idea that \"as a child myself, without benefit of personal insights subsequently gleaned from more than a decade of talk therapy, I had been left cold by Where the Wild Things Are\".[23] Deborah Stevenson, a writer for The Horn Book Magazine, talks about the effects the book had on a child who \"screamed, apparently not with delight, every time Where the Wild Things Are was read to him. It is quite possible for some young readers or listeners to be moved to alarm by a book, just as they can be moved to joy or excitement or boredom\".[24] Sendak responded to this criticism in an interview, asking: \"Did she hate her kid? Is that why she was tormenting her with this book?\"[25]\\n Despite the book\\'s popularity, Sendak refused to produce a sequel; four months before his death in 2012, he told comedian Stephen Colbert that a sequel would be \"the most boring idea imaginable\".[26] Where the Wild Things Are was number four on the list of \"Top Check Outs OF ALL TIME\" by the New York Public Library.[27]\\n An animated short adaptation which had taken five years to complete was released in 1973,[28] directed and animated by Gene Deitch and produced at Krátký film, Prague, for Weston Woods. It had narration by Allen Swift and a musique concrète score composed by Deitch himself; an updated version, which featured a new musical score and narration both by Peter Schickele, was released in 1988. This revised version was featured in a Children\\'s Circle video titled The Maurice Sendak Library.\\n In the 1980s, Sendak worked with British composer Oliver Knussen on a children\\'s opera based upon the book.[11] The opera received its first (incomplete) performance in Brussels in 1980; the first complete performance of the final version was given by the Glyndebourne Touring Opera in London in 1984. This was followed by its first U.S. performance in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1985 and the New York City premiere by New York City Opera in 1987. A concert performance was given at The Proms in the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2002.[29] A concert production was produced by New York City Opera in spring 2011.[30]\\n In 1981, the New England Dinosaur Dance Company turned the book into a dance piece with choreography by Toby Armour and music by Ezra Sims.[31] The piece debuted at Boston\\'s Wilbur Theatre on December 22, 1981.[32]\\n In 1983, Walt Disney Productions conducted a series of tests of computer-generated imagery created by Glen Keane and John Lasseter using as their subject Where the Wild Things Are.[33]\\n In 1999, Isadar released a solo piano musical composition titled \"Where the Wild Things Are\" which appeared on his album Active Imagination, inspired by the Sendak book. The composition was revisited and re-recorded in 2012 on Isadar\\'s album, Reconstructed, with Grammy winner and founder of Windham Hill Records, William Ackerman, producing.[34]\\n The 2005 Simpsons episode, \"The Girl Who Slept Too Little\", features a spoof of Where the Wild Things Are entitled \"The Land of the Wild Beasts\".\\n A live-action film version of the book was released on October 16, 2009.[35] Directed by Spike Jonze and co-produced by Sendak, the film stars Max Records as Max and features Catherine Keener as his mother, with Lauren Ambrose, Chris Cooper, Paul Dano, James Gandolfini, Catherine O\\'Hara and Forest Whitaker providing the voices of the principal Wild Things. The soundtrack was written and produced by Karen O and Carter Burwell. The screenplay was adapted by Jonze in collaboration with Dave Eggers, who also novelized the screenplay as The Wild Things, published in 2009.\\n In 2012, indie rock quartet alt-J released the song \"Breezeblocks\", inspired in part by the book.[36] Alt-J keyboardist Gus Unger-Hamilton said the story and the song share similar ideas about parting with a loved one. \"Breezeblocks\" reached certified ARIA Gold status in Australia.[37]\\n In 2016, Alessia Cara released her second single, \"Wild Things\", which charted at number fifty on the Billboard Hot 100. In an interview with ABC News Radio, Cara stated she took inspiration from Where the Wild Things Are, saying \"each \\'Thing\\' represents an emotion and [the main character] kinda escapes into this world ... and that\\'s kinda what I wanted to do\".[38]', 'The King and the Mockingbird (French: Le Roi et l\\'Oiseau, lit.\\u2009\\'The King and the Bird\\') is a traditionally-animated fantasy film directed by Paul Grimault. Prior to 2013, it was released in English as The King and Mister Bird.[1]\\n Begun in 1948 as La Bergère et le Ramoneur (lit. \"The shepherdess and the chimney sweep\", loosely based on the fairy-tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen), the film was a collaboration between Grimault and popular French poet and screenwriter Jacques Prévert. However, the film suddenly stopped production and was released unfinished by its producer in 1952, without the approval of either Grimault or Prévert. Through the course of the 1960s and 1970s, Grimault obtained the rights to the film and was able to complete a new version as they originally intended. The film was completed over 30 years after production commenced.\\n The film is today regarded as a masterpiece[2] of French animation and has been cited by the Japanese directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata as an influence. It was released in the United Kingdom dubbed into English in cinemas in 1984[1] and subsequently on VHS, but then had poor availability in English until 2014. After being re-released in France in 2013,[3] it was re-released in cinemas in the United Kingdom,[4] and the first English-friendly DVD release was made there in April 2014.[5]\\n While the completed version has not been released on home video in North America, it was available for streaming on The Criterion Channel.[6]\\n A low-budget English-language release of the 1952 version, titled The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird, is in the public domain and available free online. In that version, Peter Ustinov narrates and voices the main role of the bird.\\n The huge kingdom of Takicardia is ruled by a king under the unwieldy title of Charles V + III = VIII + VIII = XVI. He is a heartless ruler, hated by his people as much as he hates them. The King is fond of hunting, but is unfortunately cross-eyed – not that anyone would dare acknowledge this in front of him, as the numerous statues and paintings that adorn the palace and the land show him with regular eyes. Occasionally, the King does hit his target, though; notably, the wife of the bird. The bird, known only as l\\'Oiseau, is the narrator of the story and takes pleasure in taunting the king at every opportunity.\\n In his secret apartment, the King dreams of the beautiful shepherdess whose painting he keeps on his wall, but the shepherdess is in love with the chimney sweep whose hated portrait is on the opposite wall. At night, the paintings come to life and attempt to escape from the palace, but are pursued by a non-cross-eyed painting of the king that also has come to life. He deposes the real king, takes his place, and orders the capture of the shepherdess and the sweep, but the bird is there to help when called upon.\\n Later, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep find themselves in the lower city, where the inhabitants have never seen the light. Meanwhile, the King summons a robot built for him, and he attacks the village. He takes the shepherdess and captures the chimney sweep, the bird, and a blind organ-grinder from the village, putting the organ-grinder in a pen of lions and tigers. The King forces the shepherdess to agree to marry him, threatening to kill the chimney sweep if she does not accept. When she does, the King sends the chimney sweep and the bird to paint manufactured sculptures of his head on a conveyor belt. They begin to ruin the sculptures, and are sent to jail, where the lions and tigers have been listening to the organ-grinder playing. The bird convinces them to help the shepherdess, saying that her marriage to the King prevents her from tending to the sheep, which the animals eat. The animals break out of the jail and attack the interviewers and king in the chapel. The bird and his sons take control of the robot and start destroying the castle. Once the castle is in rubble, the King attacks the couple, but the robot grabs him and blows him into the distance. Sitting on the ruins of the castle the next morning, the robot sees one of the bird\\'s sons trapped in a cage. After freeing the bird, the robot smashes the cage.\\n Only the early scene in the secret apartment is based on \"The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep\", while the rest of the movie focuses much more on the king and the bird, hence the ultimate title. In Andersen\\'s tale, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep are china figurines, rather than paintings, and a wooden (mahogany) satyr wishes to wed the shepherdess, supported by a Chinaman, rather than a king and a classical statue. In both tales, the Chinaman/statue breaks, and the duo escape up the chimney, and delight in celestial bodies, but in Andersen\\'s tale the shepherdess is afraid of the wide world and the duo return; this is echoed in the movie where the statue predicts that they will return.\\n The 1952 film ends with the bird taking a photo of the newly-wed shepherdess and chimney sweep along with the king\\'s dog, all of the bird\\'s sons, and others after the king is vanquished.[7]\\n Additional voices\\n Additional voices\\n Originally titled La Bergère et le Ramoneur (lit. \"The shepherdess and the chimney sweep\"), Grimault and Prévert began the film in 1948 (following their first collaboration, Le Petit soldat, lit. \"The little soldier\", also a Hans Christian Andersen adaptation), and it was highly anticipated, but in 1950, the film was taken out of their control, and subsequently the expense of the film caused the failure of the studio (Les Gémeaux). Grimault\\'s partner André Sarrut (the producer) then released the film unfinished in 1952, against Grimault and Prévert\\'s wishes, which caused a rift between partners, and they went their separate ways. In 1967, Grimault regained possession of the film, and spent the next decade trying to finance a new version under his supervision. By 1977 he had arranged financing,[8] and thus the film was completed over the two-year period of 1977–79. In 1980 the finished film was finally released under a new title, Le Roi et l\\'Oiseau – to make clear the distinction from the earlier version – and shortly after the death of Prévert, to whom the film is dedicated.\\n The completed film uses 42 of the 62 minutes of the 1952 footage,[8] and, at 87 minutes, includes significant new animation, completely different music, and a very different, more symbolic ending. Some footage is cut, such as the bird taking over the role as announcer at the wedding and the original ending. The new footage includes both entirely new scenes, and changes to existing scenes. For example, in the completed film, the initial scenes of the king practicing target shooting and having his portrait painted are new, while the scene of the king shooting at the baby bird, which falls between these two, was from the 1952 footage. The differences between the old and new animation are visible at some points in a single scene, most noticeably in the lion pit, where the lions are drawn in two very different styles;[9] the simpler, more abstract lions are the new animation.\\n The production of the music is unusual in that Grimault left it entirely in the hands of Wojciech Kilar – Grimault gave no instruction as to what music he desired, nor was there any back-and-forth, but simply shared the movie with Kilar, who studied it carefully, then went to Poland, recorded it, and returned with the completed score, which was accepted unchanged.[8] The score was made available on an album of music from the original soundtrack, but no official sheet music exists. However, Simon Bozonnet, an amateur musician and fan of the film, released a faithful transcription of the piano theme on his website.\\n \\nThe movie is rife with cultural references.[10][11] Most basically, the castle is similar to 19th century fairy-tale castles, the best known of which is Neuschwanstein Castle, while the best-known such model in France is the medieval town Carcassonne, which notably has a surrounding ville basse (lower city), as in the movie. The city, with its dark, industrial underbelly recalls Metropolis by Fritz Lang,[10] and the enslaved work recalls Modern Times of Charlie Chaplin.  The castle, presiding over a city, has been compared to a \"Neo-Sacré-Cœur\",[8] this basilica being the highest point of Paris, presiding over the city from the top of Montmartre. The visual style is painterly, with strong perspective, recalling surrealist artists, most notably Giorgio de Chirico, but also Yves Tanguy,[11] friend of Prévert\\'s youth. See this article[12] for a sampling of scenes.\\n There are extensive allusions to Germany, particularly connections between the king and Adolf Hitler, most obviously in the king\\'s appearance on leaving water (mustache and hair strongly resembling Hitler\\'s) and in the cult of personality, but also in the king\\'s statement that \"work…is liberty\", alluding to the infamous \"Arbeit macht frei\" (work sets you free), written over the entrances to concentration camps, and also the iconic Stahlhelm (steel helmets) seen in places.\\n The king\\'s number alludes to Louis XVI of France, though visually the film recalls more the \"Sun King\" Louis XIV,[11] and parts of the castle resemble Venice, with the canals, gondola, and Bridge of Sighs. The mustached, bowler-hatted police recall Thomson and Thompson (Dupont et Dupond) from The Adventures of Tintin.[10]\\n The robot\\'s behavior recalls King Kong,[10] notably both in his chest-pounding and in his waving off the circling bird. He also rests in the figure of The Thinker, by Auguste Rodin.\\n Some potentially unfamiliar phrases and concepts used in the movie include lettres de cachet, gallows birds (gibier de potence), lèse-majesté (Contempt of the Sovereign), and the Mayor of the Palace. The bird also mentions having seen Les Cloches de Corneville, having been to the Place d\\'Italie, and having attended the Neuilly festival (Neuilly-sur-Seine is the birthplace of both Prévert and Grimault). It also mentions dernières cartouches (Last Cartridges) which alludes to an episode in the Franco-Prussian War involving the Blue Division of the French marines, memorialized in a painting by that name by Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville.\\n Others see connection with Ubu Roi (King Ubu) of Alfred Jarry, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, and Magritte.[10]\\n Grimault details some of the specific inspirations: for example, the bird was inspired by Jean Mollet (secretary of Guillaume Apollinaire) and by actor Pierre Brasseur, playing the character of Robert Macaire (via the character Frédérick Lemaître) in Les Enfants du paradis.[8]\\n In the context of the principal authors\\' other works, it is notable that this is not the only Andersen adaptation that this pair animated – Grimault and Prévert also adapted \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" as Le Petit Soldat (The Little Soldier) (1947), which is included in La Table tournante (\"The turning table\") on the deluxe edition of The King and the Mockingbird. In the early 1970s, Prévert and Grimault also made two dark animations, one apocalyptic – Le Chien mélomane (The Melomaniac Dog) (1973), which features a dog wielding a violin that caused destruction at a distance and leaves the world a gray waste (as in the end of Le Roi); both are collected in La Table tournante.\\n Grimault did not directly reuse characters between his animations, but similar characters recur – the twin police officers in Voleur de paratonnerres (\"The lightning rod thief\") are recalled by Le Sir de Massouf in La Flûte magique (\"The magic flute\"), then reappears as the chief of police in The King and the Mockingbird. Similarly, Gô from Passagers de La Grande Ourse (\"Passengers of The Great Bear) is recalled by Niglo in Marchand de notes, then becomes the chimney sweep in The King and the Mockingbird.\\n For Prévert\\'s part, he had previously written a poem about the Neuilly festival, mentioned by the bird (\"La Fête à Neuilly\", in Histoires, 1946), featuring lions, and a lion character features prominently in Children of Paradise, as do other bombastic characters, recalling and in fact inspiring the bird. He also wrote of birds in \"Pour faire le portrait d\\'un oiseau\" (To make [paint] a portrait of a bird) in Paroles (1945),[13] which, fittingly, given the long production of the movie, includes the lines \"Parfois l\\'oiseau arrive vite / mais il peut aussi bien mettre de longues années / avant de se décider\" (Often the bird arrives quickly / but he can also take many years / before he decides himself).\\n The King and the Mockingbird has been called one of the greatest animated films produced in France.[14]\\n The film had a profound influence on Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, who later founded Studio Ghibli.[6] Miyazaki states, inter alia, that \"We were formed by the films and filmmakers of the 1950s. At that time I started watching a lot of films. One filmmaker who really influenced me was the French animator Paul Grimault.\"[15] and \"It was through watching Le Roi et l\\'Oiseau by Paul Grimault that I understood how it was necessary to use space in a vertical manner.\"[16] For his part, Takahata states \"My admiration towards Paul Grimault and Le Roi et l\\'Oiseau has always been the same, probably because he achieved better than anyone else a union between literature and animation.\" The influence is also visible in The Castle of Cagliostro, whose castle resembles the castle in The King and the Mockingbird. They discuss this at length in a documentary on the deluxe edition of the Japanese DVD, noting for example that they took frame-by-frame photographs of some sequences (such as the king elbowing the court painter aside) to be able to study how the animation was done.[17] The film would be dubbed into Japanese for the release and star the voice of Gorō Naya, the voice of Koichi Zenigata, who had reprised his role for The Castle of Cagliostro.\\n It was also officially selected for the 2014 New York Film Festival.[18]\\n The King and the Mockingbird has been released in various editions, in various languages. Beyond the fundamental distinction between editions based on the incomplete 1952 version and the 1980 version, the film has been dubbed in many languages, including Japanese and Dutch.\\n In 1957, the 1952 version of the film was released in the United States and given an English-dubbed soundtrack under the title of The Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird.[19] Peter Ustinov narrates and provides the voice of the bird in this version. Since then, the Mr. Wonderbird version is now in the public domain and has been released as bargain video releases. Adventures of Mr. Wonderful was another name given to this version among many of its releases. Now Mr. Wonderbird is available for free online on the Internet Archive.\\n The 1980 version of the film was also dubbed into English with a cast of France-based American voice actors, and released in the United Kingdom in 1984, in cinemas under the title The King and Mister Bird by the Institute of Contemporary Arts[1] and on VHS under the title Mr Bird to the Rescue by Entertainment in Video.[20]\\n A Japanese-subtitled DVD version, titled Ō to Tori (王と鳥), is available through Ghibli Museum Library, and went on sale 4 April 2007, following a theatrical release in Japan starting 29 July 2006.[21]\\n In 2013, the 2003 digital restoration of the film was re-released in French cinemas in the summer, this time as a Digital Cinema Package, by Sophie Dulac Distribution.[3] It was then released on DVD in Germany on September 5 and in France in both a standard DVD edition, a Blu-ray Disc edition, and a collector\\'s box set on October 15.[3]\\n The French deluxe version Blu-ray Disc and DVD includes a collection of Grimault\\'s shorts and a 1988 documentary of Grimault and his work, La Table tournante, (\"The turning table\"), filmed by Jacques Demy, together with various shorts.\\n It was re-released as a DCP in cinemas in the United Kingdom on April 11, 2014[22] by the Independent Cinema Office, both in French with English subtitles and in the King and Mister Bird dub,[4] and on DVD with English subtitles and this dub, for the first time in both cases, on April 28, 2014.[5] Previously, it was not available in the English-speaking world except by import of the French, Japanese and German editions. Although the film does not contain a lot of dialogue, fan-created English subtitles for the completed 1980 edition are available at this page at Open Subtitles. Rialto Pictures released the film in select theaters in the United States and Lionsgate made it available on Amazon Prime Video and on Vudu.', \"Kirikou and the Sorceress (French: Kirikou et la Sorcière, [kiʁiku e la sɔʁsjɛʁ]) is a 1998 French-language animated adventure fantasy film written and directed by Michel Ocelot. Drawn from elements of West African folk tales,[4] it depicts how a newborn boy, Kirikou, saves his village from the evil witch Karaba. The film was originally released on 9 December 1998.[5] It is a co-production between companies in France (Exposure, France 3 Cinema, Les Armateurs, Monipoly, Odec Kid Cartoons), Belgium (Radio-Télévision belge) and Luxembourg (Studio O, Trans Europe Film) and animated at Rija Films' studio in Latvia and Studio Exist in Hungary.[1][5]\\n It was so successful that it was followed by Kirikou et les bêtes sauvages, released in 2005, and adapted into a stage musical, Kirikou et Karaba, first performed in 2007.[6] Another follow-up, Kirikou et les hommes et les femmes, was released in late 2012.[7]\\n In a little West African village, an unusual boy named Kirikou is born, who can speak before birth and walk immediately after birth. After Kirikou's mother tells him that an evil sorceress, Karaba, has dried up their spring and eaten all the men of the village except for one, he decides to accompany the last warrior, his uncle, to visit her and try to stop her.\\n Kirikou manages to trick the sorceress and save his uncle by waiting inside his uncle's hat and pretending that it is magic. Additionally, he saves the village's children from being kidnapped both by the sorceress's boat and tree, and kills the monster who was drinking all the village's water, gaining trust and stature in the eyes of the previously skeptical villagers. With the help of his mother and various animals, Kirikou then evades Karaba's watchmen and travels into a forbidden mountain to ask his wise old grandfather about the sorceress.\\n His grandfather tells him that she is evil because she suffers from a poisoned thorn in her back, which causes her great pain and also gives her great power. After learning this, Kirikou manages to take the sorceress's stolen gold, thus luring her outside to where he can trick her and extract the poisoned thorn. As a result, the sorceress is cured of her suffering, and she kisses Kirikou, who then becomes an adult.\\n When Kirikou and Karaba arrive back at the village, no one believes that the sorceress is cured until a procession of drummers arrive with Kirikou's grandfather. The drummers turn out to be the sorceress's watchmen and henchmen restored to their original human forms, the missing men of the village, whom she hadn't eaten after all.\\n The film is a co-production of Les Armateurs, Trans Europe Film, Studio O, France 3 cinéma, RTBF and Exposure in France, Odec Kid Cartoons in Belgium and Monipoly in Luxembourg.[1] It was animated at Rija Films' animation studio in Latvia and Studio Exist in Hungary, with backgrounds painted at Les Armateurs and Paul Thiltges' animation studio, Tiramisu, in Luxembourg, digital ink and paint and compositing by Les Armateurs and Odec Kid Cartoons in Belgium and voices and music recorded in Senegal.[8]\\n The original French voice acting was performed by a cast of West African actors and schoolchildren and recorded in Dakar. The English dubbing, also directed by Ocelot, was made in South Africa.[3] A dub of the film in the Swahili language was produced in Tanzania in 2009 through the help of the Danish Film Institute (DFI) and John Riber of Media for Development in Dar es Salaam.[9]\\n The film contains many instances of nudity that reflect the non-sexualized view of the human body in the West African culture depicted. This was controversial enough in the U.S. and the U.K. to prevent its release.[10][11][12] Eventually, the British Film Institute gave the film a few screenings in the U.K., and in the U.S. specialist distributor Artmattan released it to a small but appreciative African-American audience.[10][12]\", 'Azur & Asmar: The Princes\\' Quest (French: Azur et Asmar) is a 2006 animated fairytale fantasy film[2] written and directed by Michel Ocelot and animated at the Paris animation and visual effects studio Mac Guff Ligne. It was released in theaters in North America as just Azur & Asmar.\\n It is Ocelot\\'s fourth feature, though his first wholly original creation since Kirikou and the Sorceress, and his first use of 3D computer graphics, albeit an atypical employment of this medium with two-dimensional, painted backgrounds and non-photorealistic rendering. Like most of his films, it is an original fairy tale, in this case, inspired by the folklore (such as the One Thousand and One Nights) and decorative art of Maghreb, Algeria and especially Morocco [1] and with an increased degree of characterisation relative to his previous works which push it into the genre of fairytale fantasy.\\n The original-language version of the film has significant amounts of dialogue in both French and Arabic; however, the Arabic was not subtitled in the original French theatrical release and is not intended to be subtitled nor replaced for any other audiences.[2]\\n Once upon a time, there were two children nursed by Jénane: Azur, a blond, blue-eyed son of a nobleman, and Asmar, the tan-skinned and dark-eyed child of Jénane. The nurse tells them the story of the Djinn-fairy waiting to be freed from her prison by a good and heroic prince. Brought up together, the two boys are as close as brothers until the day Azur\\'s father cruelly separates them, banishing his nurse and Asmar from his home and sending Azur away to receive schooling from a personal tutor. Years later, Azur is haunted by memories of the legendary Djinn-fairy and takes it upon himself to journey all the way to Asmar\\'s homeland to seek her out and marry her. Now reunited, he finds that Jénane has since become a successful and rich merchant, while Asmar is now a member of the Royal Guard. However, Asmar and Azur\\'s separation has damaged their bond and Asmar also longs to find and marry the Djinn-fairy. They must learn to work together and get along again, but only one of the two princes can be successful in his quest.[1]\\n Ocelot describes the visual style of Azur & Asmar, as distinct from his earlier works, as being influenced by French art and Early Netherlandish painting of the 15th century (in particular, Jean Fouquet, the Limbourg brothers and Jan van Eyck), Persian miniatures and Islamic civilization from the Middle Ages until the 15th century and 16th century Safavid art.[4]\\n Azur & Asmar premièred on 21 May 2006 as part of the Directors\\' Fortnight of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival[1] and was released to French theatres nationwide on 25 October 2006.[5]\\n An English-subtitled version was shown at numerous film festivals including the Montreal Film Festival for Children and Sprockets Toronto International Film Festival for Children – in both cases winning the festival\\'s audience award. At the World Festival of Animated Film Zagreb - Animafest Zagreb the film won the Grand Prix - Best Feature Film award in 2007.\\n The film was subsequently dubbed into English and distributed in the United Kingdom and Ireland by Soda Pictures (now known as Thunderbird Releasing) under the expanded title Azur & Asmar: The Princes\\' Quest, receiving a limited release which began on 8 February 2008[1] and lasted several months, most likely due to the small number of dubbed prints made (as of 27 June 2008, it was still showing at one cinema in Cleethorpes).[6] It was rated U by the British Board of Film Classification for \"mild fantasy violence\"[7]\\n The film was licensed for distribution in the United States by the Weinstein Company on 13 February 2007, during the European Film Market at the Berlin International Film Festival.[8] However, as of September 2008 – over a year later – no plans to release the film in the United States had been announced. Similarly, Seville Pictures announced that they would distribute the film to both English and French speakers in Canada, but as September 2008 they have only released a DVD with only the original French dialogue and no English subtitles.[9] Some commentators had theorised that a United States release would be impossible due to Jénane\\'s nipples being visible during a breastfeeding scene early in the film (Kirikou and the Sorceress went unrated to avoid the PG-13 or higher rating it would have received from the Motion Picture Association of America despite the similarly non-sexual nature of the nudity in that film)[10] and the director\\'s refusal to allow his films to be distributed in a censored version; the Weinsteins\\' apparent dropping of the title seemed attributable to this.[11] However, in early September 2008 it was revealed to have been submitted to the MPAA by Genius Products (a home media distributor then co-owned the Weinstein Company) and received only a PG rating for \"thematic material, some mild action and peril,\" with no explicit reference made to the nudity.[12]\\n The British-dubbed version had its American première at IFC Center in New York City on 17 October 2008, and was distributed in theatres by GKIDS in collaboration with the Weinstein Company and under the shorter title of just Azur & Asmar. It was originally planned to run for one week in New York, before touring to other cities. However, due to the success of the first week (all screenings were sold out)[13] its residency was extended for a second week of screenings.

The first English translation, by Ralph Manheim, was published in 1983. It was later adapted into a film series.\\n The book centres on a boy, Bastian Balthazar Bux, an overweight and imaginative child who is neglected by his father after the death of Bastian\\'s mother. While escaping from some bullies, Bastian bursts into the antiquarian book store of Carl Conrad Coreander, where he finds his interest held by a book called The Neverending Story. Unable to resist, he steals the book and hides in his school\\'s attic, where he begins to read.\\n The story Bastian reads is set in the magical land of Fantastica, a place of wonder ruled by the benevolent and mysterious Childlike Empress. A great delegation has come to the Empress to seek her help against a formless entity called \"The Nothing\". The delegates are shocked when the Empress\\'s physician, a centaur named Cairon, informs them that the Empress is ill, and has chosen a boy warrior named Atreyu to find a cure. Upon finding Atreyu, Cairon gives him AURYN: a powerful amulet that protects him from all harm. At the advice of the giant turtle Morla the Aged One, Atreyu sets off in search of an invisible oracle known as Uyulala, who may know the Empress\\'s cure. In reaching her, he is aided by a luckdragon named Falkor, whom he rescues from the shapeshifting creature Ygramul the Many. By Uyulala, he is told the only thing that can save the Empress is a new name given to her by a human, who can only be found beyond Fantastica\\'s borders.\\n Through reading the story, Bastian becomes increasingly disturbed by hints that the characters are somehow aware that he is reading their adventures, being able to hear or even see him at points. As Falkor and Atreyu search for the borders of Fantastica, Atreyu is flung from Falkor\\'s back in a confrontation with the four Wind Giants and loses AURYN in the sea. Atreyu lands in the ruins of Spook City, the home of various creatures of darkness. Wandering the dangerous city, Atreyu finds the werewolf Gmork, chained and near death, who tells him that all the residents of the city have leapt voluntarily into The Nothing. There, thanks to the irresistible pull of the destructive phenomenon, the Fantasticans are becoming lies in the human world. The wolf also reveals that he is a servant of the force behind The Nothing and was sent to prevent the Empress\\'s chosen hero from saving her. Gmork then reveals that when the princess of the city discovered his treachery against the Empress, she imprisoned him and left him to starve to death. When Atreyu announces that he is the hero Gmork has sought, the wolf laughs and succumbs to death. When approached, Gmork\\'s body instinctively seizes Atreyu\\'s leg in his jaws, preventing him from escaping The Nothing. Meanwhile, Falkor retrieves AURYN from the sea and arrives in time to save Atreyu from the rapid approach of The Nothing.\\n Falkor and Atreyu go to the Childlike Empress, who assures them they have brought her rescuer to her; Bastian suspects that the Empress means him, but cannot bring himself to believe it. When Bastian refuses to speak the new name, to prompt him into fulfilling his role as savior, the Empress herself locates the Old Man of Wandering Mountain, who possesses a book also entitled The Neverending Story, which the Empress demands he read aloud. As he begins, Bastian is amazed to find the book he is reading is repeating itself, beginning once again whenever the Empress reaches the Old Man — only this time, the story begins with Bastian\\'s meeting with Coreander, his theft of the book, and all his actions in the attic. Realizing that the story will repeat itself forever without his intervention, Bastian names the Empress \"Moon Child\", and appears with her in Fantastica, where he restores its existence through his own imagination. The Empress has also given him AURYN, on the back of which he finds the inscription \"Do What You Wish\".\\n For each wish, Bastian loses a memory of his life as a human. Unaware of this at first, Bastian goes through Fantastica, having adventures and telling stories, while losing his memories. In spite of the warnings of Atreyu and Bastian\\'s other friends, Bastian uses AURYN to create creatures and dangers for himself to conquer, which causes some negative side effects for the rest of Fantastica, such as the rampage of the dragon \"Smerg\" and the birth of the Shlamoofs, winged insane clown creatures. After being abetted by the wicked sorceress Xayide, and with the mysterious absence of the Childlike Empress, Bastian decides to take over Fantastica as emperor. During his coronation ceremony he is stopped by Atreyu, whom Bastian grievously wounds in a battle so fierce it results in the destruction of the Ivory Tower. Bastian then enters \"The City of Old Emperors\", inhabited by human beings who came to Fantastica earlier but could not find their way out, eking out a meaningless existence there. Ultimately, a repentant Bastian is reduced to two memories: that of his father, and of his own name. After more adventures, Bastian must give up the memory of his father to discover that his strongest wish is to be capable of love and to give love to others.\\n After much searching, and having lost his final pre-Fantastican memory (his name and knowledge of himself), Bastian is unable to find the Water of Life with which to leave Fantastica with his memories. After an attack by the Shlamoofs he is rescued by Atreyu. Of his own volition, Bastian lays down AURYN at his friend\\'s feet, and Atreyu and Falkor enter AURYN with him, where the Water of Life demands to know Bastian\\'s name, and if Bastian has finished all the stories he began in his journey, which he has not. Only after Atreyu gives Bastian\\'s name and promises to complete all the stories for him does the Water of Life allow Bastian to return to the human world, along with some of the mystical waters. After drinking the Water of Life, Bastian returns to his original form, and feels comfortable and happy with it. He returns to his father, where he tells the full tale of his adventures, and thus his father is restored from his grief. Afterward, Bastian confesses to Coreander about stealing his book and losing it, but Coreander denies ever owning such a book. He reveals he has also been to Fantastica, that the book has likely moved into the hands of someone else and that Bastian—like he did—will eventually show people the many ways to Fantastica.\\n The Neverending Story was first published under the title Die unendliche Geschichte in 1979 by West German publisher Thienemann Verlag. It was number one on West Germany\\'s highly respected Der Spiegel bestseller list for 113 weeks, and remained on the list for 332 weeks.[2] The original edition was printed using red and green text: red writing to represent the story lines which take place in the human world, and green writing to represent the events taking place in Fantastica. The illustrations by Roswitha Quadflieg that begin each chapter are drawn in both colors to illustrate how the two worlds intertwine.[3] It was initially only printed as a hardcover, not paperback, because Ende wanted the book to look as much as possible like the book that Bastian steals from Mr. Coreander in the story.[4]\\n The English version, translated by Ralph Manheim, was published simultaneously in the United Kingdom and United States in 1983.[4] Several other English-language editions have since been published, with a variety of covers and lettering styles.[5] As of 2010, The Neverending Story has been translated into 36 languages, and sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[2]\\n In 1998 Der Niemandsgarten (English: The No Man\\'s Garden) was published. This anthology of Michael Ende\\'s unpublished works includes insight on the creation of The Neverending Story and has been translated into Japanese but not English.[6] Also unavailable in English is Aber das ist eine andere Geschichte – Das große Michael Ende Lesebuch (English: But that is Another Story: The Big Michael Ende Reader), which contains the previously unpublished chapter \"Bastian erlernt die Zauberkunst\" (English: \"Bastian learns the art of magic\").[7]\\n A survey conducted by German filmmaker Ulli Pfau found that The Neverending Story appeals particularly to readers aged 18–35. It remains most successful in Germany and Japan, while the 1984 film tends to be better-known among English-speaking audiences.[4]\\n Early reviews of the English-language edition included positive reviews in Library Journal and Kirkus Reviews, the latter calling The Neverending Story an \"appealing, delicately wrought, engrossing adventure—for children of all ages\".[8][9] A less positive review in gaming magazine White Dwarf took issue with the appearance of the physical book, writing that \"despite plush production the artwork is grotty, while the promised \\'shimmering copper-coloured silk\\' binding looks like plain red cloth to me. A good buy, though, unless you suffer from red/green colour blindness\".[10]\\n In subsequent years the text of The Neverending Story has been analyzed from several different viewpoints. In The Rhetoric of Character in Children\\'s Literature, literary critic Maria Nikolajeva states that \"the two parts of the novel repeat each other\" in that Bastian becomes a hero but then in the second half he \"acts not even as an antihero but as a false hero of the fairy tale\" and the characters of Bastian and Atreyu can also be seen as mirror halves.[11] Helmut Gronemann\\'s Fantastica—the Realm of the Unconscious explores the novel from a Jungian point of view, identifying archetypes and symbols in the story.[4] Additionally, some religious groups have analyzed the text for occult messages and imagery.[4]\\n The NeverEnding Story was the first film adaptation of the novel. It was released in 1984, directed by Wolfgang Petersen and starring Barret Oliver as Bastian, Noah Hathaway as Atreyu, and Tami Stronach as the Childlike Empress. It covers only the first half of the book, ending at the point where Bastian enters Fantastica (renamed \"Fantasia\" in the film), and features characters who look markedly different from how they are described in the book (most notably Bastian, who is very self-conscious about his weight in the book, but is depicted as slender in the film).[14] Ende, who was reportedly \"revolted\" by the film,[1] requested they halt production or change the film\\'s name, as he felt it had ultimately and drastically deviated from his novel; when they did neither, he sued them and subsequently lost the case.[15]\\n The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter, directed by George T. Miller and starring Jonathan Brandis and Kenny Morrison, was released in 1990. It used plot elements primarily from the second half of Ende\\'s novel, but told a new tale. Ende has dismissed both the 1984 film and its 1990 sequel as \"gigantic melodrama made of kitsch and commerce, plush and plastic\".[16]\\n The NeverEnding Story III, directed by Peter MacDonald and starring Jason James Richter, Melody Kay and Jack Black, was released in 1994 in Germany. This film was primarily based only upon the characters from Ende\\'s book but had an original story. The film was lambasted by film critics for its poor and laughable dialogue and special effects and was a box-office bomb. In addition, the US release went straight to video and received a limited theatrical run in 1996.[17]\\n In March 2024, Michael Ende Productions, in association with See-Saw Films, announced plans for a series of films based on the book.[18]\\n From 2003 to 2004, the German publishing house AVAinternational published six novels of different authors in a series called Legends of Fantastica, each using parts of the original plot and characters to compose an entirely new storyline:\\n The world première of the stage production took place in 2012 in Brisbane, Australia, by the Harvest Rain Theatre Company.[19][20]\\n In Germany, The Neverending Story has been variously adapted to a stage play, ballet and opera,[21] which premiered both at Trier and at Weimar Nationaltheater on 10 April 2004, and was subsequently staged at Linz Landestheater on 11 December. The scores to both the opera and the ballet versions were composed by Siegfried Matthus. The opera libretto was by Anton Perry.\\n In Canada, the novel was adapted to stage for the Stratford Festival for the 2019 season adapted by David S. Craig with original music by Hawksley Workman.[22]\\n The 1995 animated series was produced by Canadian animation studio Nelvana, under the title of The Neverending Story: The Animated Adventures of Bastian Balthazar Bux. The animated series ran for two years, and had a total of twenty-six episodes. Director duties were split between Marc Boreal and Mike Fallows. Each episode focused on Bastian\\'s further adventures in Fantastica, largely different from his further adventures in the book, but occasionally containing elements of them.\\n Tales from the Neverending Story, a one-season-only TV series that is loosely based on Ende\\'s novel, was produced in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, through December 2000 to August 2002 and distributed by Muse Entertainment, airing on HBO in 2002. It was aired as four two-hour television movies in the US and as a TV series of 13 one-hour episodes in the United Kingdom. The series was released on DVD in 2001.\\n On 1 September 2016, a Google Doodle created by Google artist Sophie Diao commemorated the first publication of the work, on the 37th anniversary.[23]\\n Ocean Software released a text adventure in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit computers.[24]\\n A video game based on the second film was released in 1990 by Merimpex Ltd under their Linel label and re-released by System 4 for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.[25]\\n The Ende-inspired video game AURYN Quest was released in 2002.[26]', 'The Great Gilly Hopkins is a 1978 realistic children\\'s novel by Katherine Paterson. It won the U.S. National Book Award in 1979.[2] In 2012 it was ranked number 63 among all-time children\\'s novels in a survey published by School Library Journal – the third of three books by Paterson in the top 100.[3]\\n A film adaptation starring Sophie Nélisse as Gilly Hopkins and Kathy Bates as Trotter was released in 2015.[4]\\n The novel has been translated into Catalan, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish.[5][6] Árpád Göncz\\'s Hungarian translation has been adapted into a radio play, with Zsófi Jávor playing Gilly and Márta Fónay playing Trotter.[7]\\n Galadriel \"Gilly\" Hopkins is a mean, unfriendly 11-year-old girl who is headed for yet another foster home.

Gilly doesn\\'t like the look of her new foster mom, Mrs. Trotter, a \"fat hippo\", and decides she is going to hate her whole life.\\n Gilly hatches a plan to escape from Trotter and steals the money she needs for it to work. She knows that her mother lives in San Francisco, California so she writes a letter to Courtney saying that her beloved Galadriel will be with her soon. When Gilly escapes the first time, she gets caught by police and Trotter immediately comes down to the station to retrieve her. Gilly\\'s grandmother, Nonnie, comes to Trotter\\'s house and tells her that she will take Gilly home. Nonnie was previously unaware that she had a granddaughter. By this time Gilly realizes that she really wants to be with Trotter. However, the law says that Gilly must go with Nonnie, so she goes to Nonnie\\'s house.\\n Then Gilly gets good news: her mother is coming. But when she goes to the airport, Courtney is not the woman in Gilly\\'s photograph: she has stringy hair and a lot of other traits Gilly didn\\'t expect, like being selfish. Gilly also finds out that her mother only came because Nonnie paid her, not because she wanted to come. She realizes for the first time how foolish she has been and that she actually loves Trotter. The story ends with Gilly on the phone, crying to Trotter to take her back.

In Prose. Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843 and illustrated by John Leech. It recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. In the process, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.\\n Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions, including carols, and newer customs such as cards and Christmas trees. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several establishments for London\\'s street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character  are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this is a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.\\n Published on 19 December, the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella favourably. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took legal action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, further reducing Dickens\\'s small profits from the publication. He subsequently wrote four other Christmas stories. In 1849 he began public readings of the story, which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. A Christmas Carol has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media.\\n A Christmas Carol captured the zeitgeist of the early Victorian revival of the Christmas holiday. Dickens acknowledged the influence of the modern Western observance of Christmas and later inspired several aspects of Christmas, including family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.\\n The book is divided into five chapters, which Dickens titled \"staves\".\\n A Christmas Carol opens on a bleak, cold Christmas Eve in London, seven years after the death of Ebenezer Scrooge\\'s business partner, Jacob Marley. Scrooge, an ageing miser, dislikes Christmas and refuses a dinner invitation from his nephew Fred. He turns away two men seeking a donation to provide food and heating for the poor and only grudgingly allows his overworked, underpaid clerk, Bob Cratchit, Christmas Day off with pay to conform to the social custom.\\n That night Scrooge is visited at home by Marley\\'s ghost, who wanders the Earth entwined by heavy chains and money boxes forged during a lifetime of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has a single chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and must listen or be cursed to carry much heavier chains of his own.\\n The first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, takes Scrooge to Christmas scenes of Scrooge\\'s boyhood, reminding him of a time when he was more innocent. The scenes reveal Scrooge\\'s lonely childhood at boarding school, his relationship with his beloved sister Fan, the long-dead mother of Fred, and a Christmas party hosted by his first employer, Mr Fezziwig, who treated him like a son. Scrooge\\'s neglected fiancée Belle is shown ending their relationship, as she realises that he will never love her as much as he loves money. Finally, they visit a now-married Belle with her large, happy family on the Christmas Eve that Marley died. Scrooge, upset by hearing a description of the man that he has become, demands that the ghost remove him from the house.\\n The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joyous market with people buying the makings of Christmas dinner and to celebrations of Christmas in a miner\\'s cottage and in a lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred\\'s Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit\\'s family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die unless the course of events changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge\\'s concern for their welfare.\\n The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The silent ghost reveals scenes involving the death of a disliked man whose funeral is attended by local businessmen only on condition that lunch is provided. His charwoman, laundress and the local undertaker steal his possessions to sell to a fence. When he asks the spirit to show a single person who feels emotion over his death, he is only given the pleasure of a poor couple who rejoice that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. When Scrooge asks to see tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. The ghost then allows Scrooge to see a neglected grave, with a tombstone bearing Scrooge\\'s name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to change his ways.\\n Scrooge awakens on Christmas morning a changed man. He makes a large donation to the charity he rejected the previous day, anonymously sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner and spends the afternoon at Fred\\'s Christmas party. The following day he gives Cratchit an increase in pay, and begins to become a father figure to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge treats everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.\\n The writer Charles Dickens was born to a middle-class family which got into financial difficulties as a result of the spendthrift nature of his father John. In 1824 John was committed to the Marshalsea, a debtors\\' prison in Southwark, London. Dickens, aged 12, was forced to pawn his collection of books, leave school and work at a dirty and rat-infested shoe-blacking factory. The change in circumstances gave him what his biographer, Michael Slater, describes as a \"deep personal and social outrage\", which heavily influenced his writing and outlook.[1]\\n By the end of 1842 Dickens was a well-established author with six major works[n 1] as well as several short stories, novellas and other pieces.[2] On 31 December that year he began publishing his novel Martin Chuzzlewit as a monthly serial;[n 2] it was his favourite work, but sales were disappointing and he faced temporary financial difficulties.[3]\\n Celebrating the Christmas season had been growing in popularity through the Victorian era.[4] The Christmas tree was introduced in Britain during the 18th century, and its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.[5] In the early 19th century there had been a revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert\\'s 1823 work Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England and William Sandys\\'s 1833 collection Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern led to a growth in the form\\'s popularity in Britain.[6]\\n Dickens had an interest in Christmas, and his first story on the subject was \"Christmas Festivities\", published in Bell\\'s Weekly Messenger in 1835; the story was then published as \"A Christmas Dinner\" in Sketches by Boz (1836).[7] \"The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton\", another Christmas story, appeared in the 1836 novel The Pickwick Papers. In the episode, a Mr Wardle describes a misanthropic sexton, Gabriel Grub, who undergoes a Christmas conversion after being visited by goblins who show him the past and future.[8] Slater considers that \"the main elements of the Carol are present in the story\", but not yet in a firm form.[9] The story is followed by a passage about Christmas in Dickens\\'s editorial Master Humphrey\\'s Clock.[9] The professor of English literature Paul Davis writes that although the \"Goblins\" story appears to be a prototype of A Christmas Carol, all Dickens\\'s earlier writings about Christmas influenced the story.[10]\\n Dickens was not the first author to celebrate the Christmas season in literature.[11] Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham.[12] The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that returning to Christmas traditions might promote a type of social connection that they felt had been lost in the modern world.[13]\\n Several works may have had an influence on the writing of A Christmas Carol, including two Douglas Jerrold essays: one from an 1841 issue of Punch, \"How Mr. Chokepear Keeps a Merry Christmas\" and one from 1843, \"The Beauties of the Police\".[14] More broadly, Dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories, which he closely associated with Christmas, because he saw them as stories of conversion and transformation.[15]\\n Dickens was touched by the lot of poor children in the middle decades of the 19th century.[16] In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered by seeing children working in appalling conditions.[17] The suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital\\'s half-starved, illiterate street children.[18]\\n In February 1843 the Second Report of the Children\\'s Employment Commission was published. It was a parliamentary report exposing the effects of the Industrial Revolution upon working class children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled, An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man\\'s Child, but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet\\'s production until the end of the year.[19] In March he wrote to Dr Southwood Smith, one of the four commissioners responsible for the Second Report, about his change in plans: \"you will certainly feel that a Sledge hammer has come down with twenty times the force—twenty thousand times the force—I could exert by following out my first idea\".[20]\\n In a fundraising speech on 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform,[21] and realised in the days following that the most effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.[22]\\n By mid-1843 Dickens began to suffer from financial problems. Sales of Martin Chuzzlewit were falling off, and his wife, Catherine, was pregnant with their fifth child. Matters worsened when Chapman & Hall, his publishers, threatened to reduce his monthly income by £50 if sales dropped further.[23] He began A Christmas Carol in October 1843.[24] Michael Slater, Dickens\\'s biographer, describes the book as being \"written at white heat\"; it was completed in six weeks, the final pages being written in early December.[25] He built much of the work in his head while taking night-time walks of 15 to 20 miles (24 to 32\\xa0km) around London.[26] Dickens\\'s sister-in-law wrote how he \"wept, and laughed, and wept again, and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner, in composition\".[27] Slater says that A Christmas Carol was\\n intended to open its readers\\' hearts towards those struggling to survive on the lower rungs of the economic ladder and to encourage practical benevolence, but also to warn of the terrible danger to society created by the toleration of widespread ignorance and actual want among the poor.[16] George Cruikshank, the illustrator who had earlier worked with Dickens on Sketches by Boz (1836) and Oliver Twist (1838), introduced him to the caricaturist John Leech. By 24 October Dickens invited Leech to work on A Christmas Carol, and four hand-coloured etchings and four black-and-white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text.[28] Dickens\\'s hand-written manuscript of the story does not include the sentence in the penultimate paragraph \"...\\xa0and to Tiny Tim, who did not die\"; this was added later, during the printing process.[29][n 3]\\n The central character of A Christmas Carol is Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly London-based businessman,[30] described in the story as \"a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner!\"[31] Kelly writes that Scrooge may have been influenced by Dickens\\'s conflicting feelings for his father, whom he both loved and demonised. This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man.[32] The professor of English literature Robert Douglas-Fairhurst considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge\\'s lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty \"is something of a self-parody of Dickens\\'s fears about himself\"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself.[33]\\n Scrooge could also be based on two misers: the eccentric John Elwes, MP,[34] or Jemmy Wood, the owner of the Gloucester Old Bank and also known as \"The Gloucester Miser\".[35] According to the sociologist Frank W. Elwell, Scrooge\\'s views on the poor are a reflection of those of the demographer and political economist Thomas Malthus,[36] while the miser\\'s questions \"Are there no prisons?\\xa0... And the Union workhouses?\\xa0... The treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\" are a reflection of a sarcastic question raised by the philosopher Thomas Carlyle, \"Are there not treadmills, gibbets; even hospitals, poor-rates, New Poor-Law?\"[37][n 4]\\n There are literary precursors for Scrooge in Dickens\\'s own works. Peter Ackroyd, Dickens\\'s biographer, sees similarities between the character and the elder Martin Chuzzlewit character, although the miser is \"a more fantastic image\" than the Chuzzlewit patriarch; Ackroyd observes that Chuzzlewit\\'s transformation to a charitable figure is a parallel to that of the miser.[39] Douglas-Fairhurst sees that the minor character Gabriel Grub from The Pickwick Papers was also an influence when creating Scrooge.[40][n 5] It is possible that Scrooge\\'s name came from a tombstone Dickens had seen on a visit to Edinburgh. The grave was for Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose job was given as a meal man—a corn merchant; Dickens misread the inscription as \"mean man\".[42][n 6] This theory has been described as \"a probable Dickens hoax\" for which \"[n]o one could find any corroborating evidence\".[44]\\n When Dickens was young he lived near a tradesman\\'s premises with the sign \"Goodge and Marney\", which may have provided the name for Scrooge\\'s former business partner.[45] For the chained Marley, Dickens drew on his memory of a visit to the Western Penitentiary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in March 1842, where he saw—and was affected by seeing—fettered prisoners.[37] For the character Tiny Tim, Dickens used his nephew Henry, a disabled boy who was five at the time A Christmas Carol was written.[46][n 7] The two figures of Want and Ignorance, sheltering in the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present, were inspired by the children Dickens had seen on his visit to a ragged school in the East End of London.[18]\\n The transformation of Scrooge is central to the story.[48] Davis considers Scrooge to be \"a protean figure always in process of reformation\";[49] Kelly writes that the transformation is reflected in the description of Scrooge, who begins as a two-dimensional character, but who then grows into one who \"possess[es] an emotional depth [and] a regret for lost opportunities\".[50] Some writers, including the Dickens scholar Grace Moore, consider that there is a Christian theme running through A Christmas Carol, and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the Christian concept of redemption.[51][n 8] Dickens\\'s biographer, Claire Tomalin, sees the conversion of Scrooge as carrying the Christian message that \"even the worst of sinners may repent and become a good man\".[54] Dickens\\'s attitudes towards organised religion were complex;[n 9] he based his beliefs and principles on the New Testament.[53] His statement that Marley \"had no bowels\" is a reference to the \"bowels of compassion\" mentioned in the First Epistle of John, the reason for his eternal damnation.[57][n 10]\\n Other writers, including Kelly, consider that Dickens put forward a \"secular vision of this sacred holiday\".[11] The Dickens scholar John O. Jordan argues that A Christmas Carol shows what Dickens referred to in a letter to his friend John Forster as his \"Carol philosophy, cheerful views, sharp anatomisation of humbug, jolly good temper\\xa0... and a vein of glowing, hearty, generous, mirthful, beaming reference in everything to Home and Fireside\".[58] From a secular viewpoint, the cultural historian Penne Restad suggests that Scrooge\\'s redemption underscores \"the conservative, individualistic and patriarchal aspects\" of Dickens\\'s \"Carol philosophy\" of charity and altruism.[59]\\n Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol in response to British social attitudes towards poverty, particularly child poverty, and wished to use the novella as a means to put forward his arguments against it.[60] The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance.[61] The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim.[62] Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity without alienating his largely middle-class readership.[63]\\n As the result of the disagreements with Chapman and Hall over the commercial failures of Martin Chuzzlewit,[64] Dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself, in exchange for a percentage of the profits.[33] Production of A Christmas Carol was not without problems. The first printing was meant to have festive green endpapers, but they came out a dull olive colour. Dickens\\' publisher Chapman and Hall replaced these with yellow endpapers and reworked the title page in harmonising red and blue shades.[65] The final product was bound in red cloth with gilt-edged pages, completed only two days before the publication date of 19 December 1843.[66] Following publication, Dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in red Morocco leather and presented as a gift to his solicitor, Thomas Mitton.[67][n 11]\\n Priced at five shillings (equal to £31 in 2024 pounds),[68] the first run of 6,000 copies sold out by Christmas Eve. Chapman and Hall issued second and third editions before the new year, and the book continued to sell well into 1844.[70] By the end of 1844 eleven more editions had been released.[71] Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.[72] It was Dickens\\'s most popular book in the United States, and sold over two million copies in the hundred years following its first publication there.[52]\\n The high production costs upon which Dickens insisted led to reduced profits, and the first edition brought him only £230 (equal to £29,000 in 2024 pounds)[68] rather than the £1,000 (equal to £124,000 in 2024 pounds)[68] he expected.[73] A year later, the profits were only £744, and Dickens was deeply disappointed.[64][n 12]\\n According to Douglas-Fairhurst, contemporary reviews of A Christmas Carol \"were almost uniformly kind\".[75] The Illustrated London News described how the story\\'s \"impressive eloquence\\xa0... its unfeigned lightness of heart—its playful and sparkling humour\\xa0... its gentle spirit of humanity\" all put the reader \"in good humour with ourselves, with each other, with the season and with the author\".[76] The critic from The Athenaeum, the literary magazine, considered it a \"tale to make the reader laugh and cry\\xa0– to open his hands, and open his heart to charity even toward the uncharitable\\xa0... a dainty dish to set before a King.\"[77] William Makepeace Thackeray, writing in Fraser\\'s Magazine, described the book as \"a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness. The last two people I heard speak of it were women; neither knew the other, or the author, and both said, by way of criticism, \\'God bless him!\\'\"[74]\\n The poet Thomas Hood, in his own journal, wrote that \"If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and charitable observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease.\"[78] The reviewer for Tait\\'s Edinburgh Magazine—Theodore Martin, who was usually critical of Dickens\\'s work[75]—spoke well of A Christmas Carol, noting it was \"a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good\".[79] After Dickens\\'s death, Margaret Oliphant deplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as \"a new gospel\", and noted that the book was unique in that it made people behave better.[75] The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1844, Christian Remembrancer thought the tale\\'s old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author\\'s sense of humour and pathos.[80] The writer and social thinker John Ruskin told a friend that he thought Dickens had taken the religion from Christmas, and had imagined it as \"mistletoe and pudding – neither resurrection from the dead, nor rising of new stars, nor teaching of wise men, nor shepherds\".[81]\\n There were critics of the book. The New Monthly Magazine praised the story, but thought the book\\'s physical excesses—the gilt edges and expensive binding—kept the price high, making it unavailable to the poor. The review recommended that the tale should be printed on cheap paper and priced accordingly.[82] An unnamed writer for The Westminster Review mocked Dickens\\'s grasp of economics, asking \"Who went without turkey and punch in order that Bob Cratchit might get them—for, unless there were turkeys and punch in surplus, someone must go without\".[83]\\n Dickens had criticised the US in American Notes and Martin Chuzzlewit, making American readers reluctant to embrace his work, but by the end of the American Civil War, the book had gained wide recognition in American households.[84] In 1863 The New York Times published an enthusiastic review, noting that the author brought the \"old Christmas\\xa0... of bygone centuries and remote manor houses, into the living rooms of the poor of today\".[85]\\n In January 1844 Parley\\'s Illuminated Library published an unauthorised version of the story in a condensed form which they sold for twopence.[n 13] Dickens wrote to his solicitor\\n I have not the least doubt that if these Vagabonds can be stopped they must.\\xa0... Let us be the sledge-hammer in this, or I shall be beset by hundreds of the same crew when I come out with a long story.[87] Two days after the release of the Parley version, Dickens sued on the basis of copyright infringement and won. The publishers declared themselves bankrupt and Dickens was left to pay £700 in costs.[88] The small profits Dickens earned from A Christmas Carol further strained his relationship with his publishers, and he broke with them in favour of Bradbury and Evans, who had been printing his works to that point.[16]\\n Dickens returned to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised on the success of the book by publishing other Christmas stories: The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost\\'s Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which acknowledged the progressive societal changes of the previous year, and highlighted those social problems which still needed to be addressed. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.[89]\\n By 1849 Dickens was engaged with David Copperfield and had neither the time nor the inclination to produce another Christmas book.[90] He decided the best way to reach his audience with his \"Carol philosophy\" was by public readings.[91] During Christmas 1853 he gave a reading in Birmingham Town Hall to the Industrial and Literary Institute. He insisted that tickets be reserved for working-class attendees at quarter-price and the performance was a great success.[92][93][94] Thereafter, he read the tale in an abbreviated version 127 times, until 1870 (the year of his death), including at his farewell performance.[95]\\n In the years following the book\\'s publication, responses to the tale were published by W. M. Swepstone (Christmas Shadows, 1850), Horatio Alger (Job Warner\\'s Christmas, 1863), Louisa May Alcott (A Christmas Dream, and How It Came True, 1882), and others who followed Scrooge\\'s life as a reformed man\\xa0– or some who thought Dickens had got it wrong and needed to be corrected.[96]\\n The novella was adapted for the stage almost immediately. Three productions opened on 5 February 1844, one by Edward Stirling, A Christmas Carol; or, Past, Present, and Future, being sanctioned by Dickens and running for more than 40 nights.[97] By the close of February 1844 eight rival A Christmas Carol theatrical productions were playing in London.[75] The story has been adapted for film and television more than any of Dickens\\'s other works.[98] In 1901 it was produced as Scrooge, or, Marley\\'s Ghost, a silent black-and-white British film; it was one of the first known adaptations of a Dickens work on film, but it is now largely lost.[99] The story was adapted in 1923 for BBC radio.[100] It has been adapted to other media, including opera, ballet, animation, stage musicals and a BBC mime production starring Marcel Marceau.[101]\\n Davis considers the adaptations have become better remembered than the original. Some of Dickens\\'s scenes—such as visiting the miners and lighthouse keepers—have been forgotten by many, while other events often added—such as Scrooge visiting the Cratchits on Christmas Day—are now thought by many to be part of the original story. Accordingly, Davis distinguishes between the original text and the \"remembered version\".[102]\\n The phrase \"Merry Christmas\" had been around for many years – the earliest known written use was in a letter in 1534 – but Dickens\\'s use of the phrase in A Christmas Carol popularised it among the Victorian public.[103] The exclamation \"Bah! Humbug!\" entered popular use in the English language as a retort to anything sentimental or overly festive;[104] the name \"Scrooge\" became used as a designation for a miser and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary as such in 1982.[105]\\n In the early 19th century the celebration of Christmas was associated in Britain with the countryside and peasant revels, disconnected to the increasing urbanisation and industrialisation taking place. Davis considers that in A Christmas Carol, Dickens showed that Christmas could be celebrated in towns and cities, despite increasing modernisation.[106] The modern observance of Christmas in English-speaking countries is largely the result of a Victorian-era revival of the holiday. The Oxford Movement of the 1830s and 1840s had produced a resurgence of the traditional rituals and religious observances associated with Christmastide and, with A Christmas Carol, Dickens captured the zeitgeist while he reflected and reinforced his vision of Christmas.[107]\\n Dickens advocated a humanitarian focus of the holiday,[108] which influenced several aspects of Christmas that are still celebrated in Western culture, such as family gatherings, seasonal food and drink, dancing, games and a festive generosity of spirit.[109][n 14] The historian Ronald Hutton writes that Dickens \"linked worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation\".[110]\\n The novelist William Dean Howells, analysing several of Dickens\\'s Christmas stories, including A Christmas Carol, considered that by 1891 the \"pathos appears false and strained; the humor largely horseplay; the characters theatrical; the joviality pumped; the psychology commonplace; the sociology alone funny\".[111][112] The writer James Joyce considered that Dickens took a childish approach with A Christmas Carol, producing a gap between the naïve optimism of the story and the realities of life at the time.[112]\\n Ruth Glancy, the professor of English literature, states that the largest impact of A Christmas Carol was the influence felt by individual readers.[113] In early 1844 The Gentleman\\'s Magazine attributed a rise of charitable giving in Britain to Dickens\\'s novella;[114] in 1874, Robert Louis Stevenson, after reading Dickens\\'s Christmas books, vowed to give generously to those in need,[115] and Thomas Carlyle expressed a generous hospitality by hosting two Christmas dinners after reading the book.[116] In 1867 one American businessman was so moved by attending a reading that he closed his factory on Christmas Day and sent every employee a turkey,[75] while in the early years of the 20th century Maud of Wales – the Queen of Norway – sent gifts to London\\'s crippled children signed \"With Tiny Tim\\'s Love\".[117] On the novella, the author G. K. Chesterton wrote \"The beauty and blessing of the story\\xa0... lie in the great furnace of real happiness that glows through Scrooge and everything around him.\\xa0... Whether the Christmas visions would or would not convert Scrooge, they convert us.\"[118]\\n Analysing the changes made to adaptations over time, Davis sees changes to the focus of the story and its characters to reflect mainstream thinking of the period. While Dickens\\'s Victorian audiences would have viewed the tale as a spiritual but secular parable, in the early 20th century it became a children\\'s story, read by parents who remembered their parents reading it when they were younger. In the lead-up to and during the Great Depression, Davis suggests that while some saw the story as a \"denunciation of capitalism,\\xa0...most read it as a way to escape oppressive economic realities\".[119] The film versions of the 1930s were different in the UK and US. British-made films showed a traditional telling of the story, while US-made works showed Cratchit in a more central role, escaping the depression caused by European bankers and celebrating what Davis calls \"the Christmas of the common man\".[120] In the 1960s, Scrooge was sometimes portrayed as a Freudian figure wrestling with his past. By the 1980s he was again set in a world of depression and economic uncertainty.[120]\\n  Literature portal\\n Novels portal', '\"The Little Mermaid\" (Danish: Den lille havfrue), sometimes translated in English as \"The Little Sea Maid\",[1] is a fairy tale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. Originally published in 1837 as part of a collection of fairy tales for children, the story follows the journey of a young mermaid princess who is willing to give up her life in the sea as a mermaid to gain a human soul.\\n The original story has been the subject of multiple analyses by scholars such as Jacob Bøggild and Pernille Heegaard, as well as the folklorist Maria Tatar. These analyses cover various aspects of the story, from interpreting the themes to discussing why Andersen chose to write a tragic story with a happy ending. It has been adapted to various media, including musical theatre, anime, ballet, opera, and film. There is also a statue portraying the mermaid in Copenhagen, Denmark, where the story was written and first published.\\n The Little Mermaid lives in a Utopian underwater kingdom with her widowed father, the Sea King, her paternal grandmother, and her five older sisters, each one of them born a year apart. The Little Mermaid is fascinated by the world above the sea, and human beings, and keeps a statue of a human boy in her garden in the palace. Lonely and feeling isolated from her family, she yearns to explore the world above, and constantly asks her grandmother to tell her stories of humans.\\n When a mermaid turns fifteen, she is permitted to swim to the surface for the first time to catch a glimpse of the world above. When the six mermaids become old enough, each of them visits the upper world one at a time every year. As each returns, the Little Mermaid listens longingly to their various descriptions of the world inhabited by human beings. The elder sisters, however, soon become jaded of the world above and are content to remain below the sea.\\n When the Little Mermaid\\'s turn comes, she rises up to the surface, watches a birthday celebration being held on a ship in honor of a handsome prince, and falls in love with him from a safe distance. A violent storm then hits, sinking the ship, and the Little Mermaid saves the prince from drowning. She delivers him unconscious to the shore near a temple. Here, the Little Mermaid waits until a young woman from the temple and her ladies-in-waiting find him. To her dismay, the prince never sees the Little Mermaid or even realizes that it was she who had originally saved his life.\\n The Little Mermaid becomes melancholic and asks her grandmother if humans can live forever. Her grandmother explains that humans have a much shorter lifespan than mermaids (around 300 years), but that they have an eternal soul that lives on in heaven, while mermaids turn to sea foam at death and cease to exist.\\n The Little Mermaid, longing for the prince and an eternal soul, visits the Sea Witch who lives in a dangerous part of the ocean, surrounded by a forest of polyps, mud, and whirlpools. Although the witch warns the Little Mermaid that her attempts to win the love of the prince are doomed, she willingly helps her by selling her a potion that gives her legs in exchange for her voice (her tongue), as the Little Mermaid has the most enchanting voice in the entire world. The witch warns the Little Mermaid that once she becomes a human, she will never be able to return to the sea. Consuming the potion will make her feel as if a sword is being passed through her body. When she recovers, she will have two human legs and will be able to dance as no human has ever danced before; however, the pain of losing her tail will never leave her: she will constantly feel as if she is walking on sharp knives, and her feet will bleed terribly. Moreover, she will obtain a soul only if she wins the love of the prince and marries him, for then a part of his soul will flow into her. Otherwise, at dawn on the first day after he marries someone else, the Little Mermaid will die with a broken heart and dissolve into sea foam upon the waves.\\n After she agrees to the arrangement, the Little Mermaid swims up to the surface near the prince\\'s castle and drinks the potion. The liquid feels like a sword piercing her body and she passes out on the shore, naked. She is found by the prince, who is mesmerized by her beauty and grace, even though he discovers that she is mute. Most of all, he likes to see her dance, and she dances for him despite suffering excruciating pain with every step. Soon, the Little Mermaid becomes the prince\\'s favorite companion and accompanies him on many of his outings. As she is mute, he confides in her his deepest thoughts and feelings—but he does not fall in love with her at all: he regards her more as a pet than a person, and has her sleep on the floor outside his bedroom door.\\n Despite the indifference of the prince and the agonising pain she constantly suffers, the Little Mermaid is happy. She loves exploring the world she was obsessed with for so long; every night she goes down to the seashore to bathe her tortured feet in the cold seawater. Her sisters come to her at night, along with their father and grandmother, and feel betrayed and heartbroken that she has left them. Although the Little Mermaid misses her family very much, she is happier in the human world than she was under the sea.\\n When the prince\\'s parents encourage him to marry the neighboring princess in an arranged marriage, the prince tells the Little Mermaid he will not because he does not love the princess. He goes on to say that he can only love the young woman from the temple, whom he believes rescued him. It turns out that the princess from the neighboring kingdom was the temple woman, as she was sent to the temple for her education. The prince declares his love for her, and the royal wedding is announced at once.\\n The prince and princess celebrate their new marriage aboard a wedding ship, and the Little Mermaid\\'s heart breaks. She thinks of all that she has sacrificed and of all the pain she has endured for the prince. She despairs, thinking of the death that awaits her, but before dawn, her sisters rise out of the water and bring her a dagger that the Sea Witch has given them in exchange for their long, beautiful hair. If the Little Mermaid kills the prince and lets his blood drip on her feet, she will become a mermaid once more, all her suffering will end, and she will live out her full life in the ocean with her family. However, the Little Mermaid cannot bring herself to kill the sleeping prince lying with his new wife, and she throws the dagger and herself off the ship into the water just as dawn breaks.\\n Her body dissolves into foam, but instead of ceasing to exist, she feels the warm sun and discovers that she has turned into a luminous and ethereal earthbound spirit, a daughter of the air, and has regained the ability to speak. As the Little Mermaid ascends into the atmosphere, she is greeted by other daughters, who tell her she has become like them because she strove with all her heart to obtain an immortal soul.\\n Because of the Little Mermaid\\'s sacrifice, she is given a chance to do good deeds for all her lifespan (300 years like the merpeople) and she will receive her soul and rise up into Heaven when her lifespan ends.\\n \"The Little Mermaid\" was written by Hans Christian Andersen in 1836 and first published by C.A. Reitzel in Copenhagen on 7 April 1837 in Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection. (Danish: Eventyr, fortalte for Børn. Første Samling.), a collection of nine fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen.\\n The story was republished on 18 December 1849 as a part of Fairy Tales. 1850 (Eventyr. 1850), and again on 15 December 1862 as a part of the first volume of Fairy Tales and Stories (Eventyr og Historier).[2]\\n The ending with the mermaid\\'s death and resurrection caused debate and critique. On the fact that children are told that their good behavior will help the mermaid earn her soul more quickly, but their bad behavior will add days to her time of service, P. L. Travers, author of Mary Poppins and noted folklore commentator, wrote, \"a year taken off when a child behaves; a tear shed and a day added whenever a child is naughty? Andersen, this is blackmail. And the children know it and say nothing. There\\'s magnanimity for you.\"[3][4]\\n Other scholars like Jacob Bøggild and Pernille Heegaard notice the ending\\'s shift away from tragedy as well. They point out that the events leading up to the mermaid\\'s death should culminate in tragedy, but that the sudden twist allows the narrative to finish on a hopeful success. Bøggild and Heegaard argue that this disjointed ending was not the result of Andersen\\'s sentimentality and religious beliefs—to which have been attributed his choice to stray from the tragic path in the rest of the narrative.  Rather, a conscious choice for ambiguity stemmed from Andersen\\'s skepticism towards idealized physical and religious symbols.[5]\\n However, other critics including Søren Baggesen and James Massengale have argued that the ending is not tacked on, but is a natural part of the story\\'s structure as a religious narrative.[6] The working title of the story was \"Daughters of the Air\",[3] which are spirits who, as Andersen conceived them, can earn souls by doing three hundred years\\' worth of good deeds. At the end of the story, one of these spirits explains to the Little Mermaid that they do as many good things for humankind as they are able so that, at the end of those years, they can receive an immortal soul and \"take part in the happiness of mankind\".[7] The spirits also explain that because the Little Mermaid refused to kill the Prince and has spent so much time in pain while still doing good things for men, she has \"raised [herself] to the spirit-world\" and can participate in the three hundred years of good deeds alongside the Daughters of the Air.\\n Andersen was influenced by Undine, another story of a mermaid gaining a soul through marriage, but felt that his ending was an improvement. In 1837, shortly after completing his manuscript, Andersen wrote to a friend, \"I have not, like de la Motte Fouqué in Undine, allowed the mermaid\\'s acquiring of an immortal soul to depend upon an alien creature, upon the love of a human being. I\\'m sure that\\'s wrong! It would depend rather much on chance, wouldn\\'t it? I won\\'t accept that sort of thing in this world. I have permitted my mermaid to follow a more natural, more divine path.\"[8][9] Andersen was concerned that the story\\'s meanings would appeal best to adults, but wrote in the foreword to Fairy Tales Told for Children, \"I dare presume, however, that the child will also enjoy it and that the denouement itself, plainly considered, will grip the child.\"[10]\\n In Maria Tatar\\'s The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales, the transformation of the little mermaid from sea creature to mermaid in human form, and then to a creature of the air, is believed to reflect Andersen\\'s constant engagement with mutability and changes in identity.[11] Tatar also suggests that the Little Mermaid did not give up everything for love alone. Tatar\\'s interpretation of the tale is one that presents a rare heroine with an investigative curiosity which is shown through the mermaid\\'s fascination with the unknown, the forbidden, and her intent on broadening her horizons from the start. Even before she sees the prince, she displays an intense longing to visit the world above the sea through her actions such as: arranging the flowers in her garden into the shape of the sun, listening to her grandmother and sisters\\' stories of the surface, and peeking in through the window of the prince\\'s cabin during his birthday celebrations. Tatar argues that the mermaid wants, above all, to explore the world and discover things that are beyond what she already knows. The world above seems larger than her own and holds a greater range of possibilities to exercise her adventurous spirit. This is demonstrated in some versions of the story when the prince has a page boy\\'s costume made for her so that she may ride on horseback and explore the land with him. Here, her willingness to cross-dress implies a willingness to transcend gender boundaries and take risks to be able to see the world. Tatar feels this also comments on Andersen\\'s interests in changes in identity.[12]\\n In her analysis, Virginia Borges concludes that the story contains a theme about love and self-sacrifice and the dangers of accepting abuse or inconsiderate treatment in the name of love.[13]\\n Alienation, or feeling like an outsider , is also a theme of the tale. The Little Mermaid feels isolated throughout the story and struggles to find her place in the world. She feels that she does not belong in the world under the sea and is disconnected from her own people, but she does not feel that she belongs in the human world either, where she constantly suffers agonising pain and is treated as an animal or an amusement by the prince. [14][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]\\n The story could also be considered by whom?a cautionary tale, suggesting that  people should love what they already have, lest they lose it forever. The Little Mermaid has a beautiful home under the sea and a loving family, yet willingly abandons them to embark on an ill-fated quest to win the love of a man who never loves her in return. The Little Mermaid\\'s endeavours to earn an immortal soul through the love of a prince are fraught with suffering from the beginning: she is constantly racked with horrific pain from losing her tail; the prince regards her as a plaything rather than a love interest; and on the evening of his wedding before the sun rises, the Little Mermaid laments the home and family she has left behind. She was warned by the Sea Witch that once she became a human, she would never be able to return to her home and she would die the day after the prince married someone else, but the Little Mermaid was heedless of the consequences and, thus, her home and family were lost to her as a result. [15][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]\\n Susan White interprets the story as the difficult liminal passage of the girl into the order of speech and social symbolism (power, politics, and agency) which is symbolically understood as masculine.[16]\\n The artist Pen Dalton has made use of Laura Mulvey\\'s interpretation of fetishism in art to link The Little Mermaid to the wearing of fetishistic clothes, and obsessive cosmetic surgery with masculine fears of loss.[17]\\n The American writer Rictor Norton, in My Dear Boy: Gay Love Letters through the Centuries, and the German scholar Heinrich Detering, in Das offene Geheimnis (The Open Secret), theorize that The Little Mermaid was written as a love letter by Hans Christian Andersen to Edvard Collin.[18][19] This is based on a letter Andersen wrote to Collin, upon hearing of Collin\\'s engagement to a young woman, around the same time that the Little Mermaid was written. Andersen wrote \"I languish for you as for a pretty Calabrian wench ... my sentiments for you are those of a woman. The femininity of my nature and our friendship must remain a mystery.\"[20] Andersen also sent the original story to Collin.[21] Norton interprets the correspondence as a declaration of Andersen\\'s homosexual love for Collin and describes The Little Mermaid as an allegory for Andersen\\'s life.[22]\\n In 1958, NBC began airing a new television show titled Shirley Temple\\'s Storybook, an American children\\'s anthology series that was hosted and narrated by actress Shirley Temple. The series features adaptations of fairy tales like Mother Goose and other family-oriented stories performed by well-known actors. The first season of sixteen black-and-white and colored episodes aired on NBC between 12 January 1958, and 21 December 1958, as Shirley Temple\\'s Storybook. Thirteen episodes of the first season re-ran on ABC beginning on 12 January 1959.[23] The second season of twenty-five color episodes aired on NBC as The Shirley Temple Show between 18 September 1960, and 16 July 1961 in much the same format that it had under its original title.\\n The show aired their adaptation of The Little Mermaid on 5 March 1961 as episode 22 during the show\\'s second season. Shirley Temple herself played the mermaid. Unlike the original story, the mermaid does not give up her voice to become human, but she still fails to win the prince\\'s heart when he falls in love with the princess who found him. In the end, when she cannot bring herself to kill the prince with the dagger, she prepares to throw herself into the sea. Neptune himself intervenes and says that for her selfless act, she has earned the right to become a mermaid again and rejoin her family, giving the story a happy ending.\\n This 1976 Russian feature film was directed by Vladimir Bychkov and starred Viktoriya Novikova as the mermaid. The story is set in the 13th century. The mermaid saves the prince from drowning, after other mermaids mesmerize the sailors into crashing their ship onto the rocks. The prince is saved by a local princess under whose care he recovers. The mermaid seeks to marry the prince. A traveling handyman tries to help the mermaid in her love. He finds a local witch who changes her tail into legs in exchange for her hair. The prince marries the local princess and the mermaid is destined to die on the same day. The traveling handyman challenges the prince to a fight and is killed. His sacrifice spares the mermaid from death and her soul becomes eternal.\\n Filmed in 1987, this installment of Shelley Duvall\\'s Faerie Tale Theatre gives the Little Mermaid the name \"Pearl.\" She lives under the sea with her father the king and her three older sisters.\\n On her fifteenth birthday, she goes to the surface and sees a prince on a ship and falls in love with him while singing to him from the sea. Later, when the ship catches fire and the prince is thrown into the sea, Pearl rescues him and brings him to shore. There, she revives him and they kiss though he is not fully conscious and for him it is as a dream.  Pearl must return to the sea before he is fully awake.\\n Pearl tells her family what happened and that she\\'s in love with a mortal. They try to talk her out of it, but instead she goes to see the Sea Witch- who also tries to talk her out of it. Pearl is determined. She exchanges her voice for legs. If she cannot win the prince\\'s love, she will turn into sea foam the morning after he weds another.\\n Meanwhile the prince, still on the beach where Pearl brought him, is found by a princess of a neighboring kingdom, Amelia. The prince transfers his feelings of love for Pearl onto her, believing she is his rescuer, and they begin a courtship that they find each of their father\\'s had hoped would happen so they could conjoin their kingdoms.\\n The prince and Amelia are out walking when they come across Pearl, naked and newly-legged, on the shore.

Her body then disappears as expected but because she was pure of heart she did not disappear into sea foam but instead became a spirit of the air and watched over the royal couple for the rest of their long, happy lives.\\n Disney\\'s The Little Mermaid is a 1989 American animated musical fantasy romance film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Loosely based on the original tale, the 1989 Disney film tells the story of a mermaid princess named Ariel, who dreams of becoming human, especially after falling in love with a human prince named Eric. Written, produced, and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, with music by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (who also served as a co-producer), the film features the voices of Jodi Benson, Christopher Daniel Barnes, and Pat Carroll among others.\\n The Little Mermaid was originally planned as part of one of Walt Disney\\'s earliest feature films, a proposed package film featuring vignettes of Hans Christian Andersen tales.[24] Development started in the late 1930s but was delayed due to various circumstances.[25] In 1985, Ron Clements became interested in a film adaptation of The Little Mermaid while he was serving as a director on The Great Mouse Detective (1986).[26] Clements discovered the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale while browsing through a bookstore.[27] Believing the story provided an \"ideal basis\" for an animated feature film and keen on creating a film that took place underwater,[26] Clements wrote and presented a two-page treatment of Mermaid to Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, who approved of the idea for possible development the next day. While in production in the 1980s, the staff by chance found the original story and visual development work done by Kay Nielsen for Disney\\'s proposed 1930s Andersen feature.[24] Many of the changes made by the staff in the 1930s to Hans Christian Andersen\\'s original story were coincidentally the same as the changes made by Disney writers in the 1980s.[27]\\n In 2023, the 1989 film was adapted into a live-action remake.[28]\\n A statue of The Little Mermaid sits on a rock in the Copenhagen harbor in Langelinie. This small and unimposing statue is a Copenhagen icon and tourist attraction.\\n The statue was commissioned in 1909 by Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of Carlsberg, after he had been fascinated by a ballet based on the fairy tale. The sculptor Edward Eriksen created the statue, which was unveiled on 23 August 1913. His wife, Eline Eriksen, was the model for the body. Ellen Price, the ballerina who danced the Little Mermaid in the 1909 Royal Danish Ballet production, was the model for the head and face.[29] The statue has been severely vandalized several times.[30]\\n In May 2010, it was moved from its Copenhagen harbor emplacement for the first time ever, for transport to Expo 2010 in Shanghai, where it remained until 20 November 2010.[31]\\n A statue of The Little Mermaid looks out over Larvotto beach in Monaco. She was created in 2000 by Kristian Dahlgard, with several layers of metal, in homage to the Danes who live in Monaco and for the late Prince Rainier III to mark the 50th year of his reign.', \"The Three Robbers is a children's book by Tomi Ungerer. There was a 6-minute animated adaptation released in 1972 by Gene Deitch.\\n Triplet brothers are very successful in their exploits as highwayman robbers: Dominik using his blunderbuss to intimidate coachmen and passengers, Felix using his pepper-blower to disorientate and blind the horses, while Maximus vandalizes and damages the carriage wheels with his red battle axe. But, one day the robbers intercept a carriage, only to find a lonely girl named Tiffany whose parents died and is being sent to live with a wicked aunt who runs an orphanage. Not wanting to go to the orphanage, Tiffany tricks the robbers into believing she was the daughter of a maharaja, and is carried off to their hideout. While Tiffany makes the robbers question what they intend to do with their amassed wealth, she helps them learn to read and write when they want to send a ransom letter. The robbers eventually learn Tiffany lied to them when they found her missing child poster. Tiffany is remorseful and leaves in shame to head to the orphanage.\\n Tiffany encounters two runaway orphans along the way to the orphanage. From them she learns that Auntie places the children in mandatory child labor to harvest sugar beets and extract the sugar for her pastry-making machine to make her desserts. After secretly entering the orphanage while the runways are captured, Tiffany exposes Auntie's pastry hoard to the other orphans. Auntie was about to punish Tiffany when the robbers arrive, revealed to be runaway orphans themselves as they make amends with Tiffany. Auntie refuses to hand Tiffany over to the robbers before falling into her pastry-making vat in a fit of insanity and is turned into a cake which the orphans eat. The robbers then use their wealth to buy the orphanage, which becomes a haven for all uncared children; eventually growing into a large town with its residents revering the robbers.\\n The book was adapted as a full-length feature film by Hayo Freitag, released in mid-2007 as Die Drei Rauber. This was adapted into a French version called Les Trois Brigands then an English one called Trick or Treaters, which removed the original narration by Tomi Ungerer along with cutting out some of the original movie to shorten it and added a Halloween theme with the new narrator.[1]\\n The film received the second prize for Animated Feature Film or Video in the Adult Jury Prizes at the Chicago International Children's Film Festival in 2007,[2] and in 2008 and 2009 was awarded first prizes and audience awards at film festivals in Hamburg (Germany), Paris, Bordeaux, Annecy (France), Poznan (Poland), Bilbao (Spain), Brussels, Ghent (Belgium), Bucharest (Romania), and Toronto. It received the audience Award at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, 2008. Trick or Treaters DVD was released on September 6, 2016 in United States.\"]\n"

Elle en tomba amoureuse.\\n\\nUn jour, après une tempête, elle sauva le prince de la noyade. Mais, comme il ne se souvenait pas qu'elle l'avait sauvé, il tomba amoureux d'une autre princesse. Pour pouvoir être avec le prince, la petite sirène demanda à la sorcière de la mer de lui donner des jambes, en échange de sa belle voix. Ainsi, elle put marcher sur la terre, mais chaque pas lui faisait très mal.\\n\\nMalgré la douleur, elle passa beaucoup de temps avec le prince, mais il la considérait plutôt comme une amie. Lorsqu'il décida d'épouser la princesse, la petite sirène eut le cœur brisé. Ses sœurs lui apportèrent un couteau magique de la sorcière pour qu'elle redevienne une sirène, mais elle ne put se résoudre à blesser celui qu'elle aimait.\\n\\nAu lieu de disparaître en écume, la petite sirène devint un esprit de l'air, car elle avait été courageuse et gentille. Elle put ainsi continuer à faire de bonnes actions et gagner une âme pour monter au ciel un jour. C'était une histoire de courage, d'amour et de sacrifices.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)\n",

Dominik, Felix et Maximus étaient très forts dans leurs aventures : Dominik effrayait les gens avec son gros fusil, Felix utilisait du poivre pour semer la confusion, et Maximus cassait les roues des carrosses avec sa hache. Mais un jour, ils arrêtèrent une calèche et ne trouvèrent à l'intérieur qu'une petite fille seule, nommée Tiffany. Ses parents étaient morts, et elle se rendait chez une méchante tante.\\n\\nTiffany, malicieuse, raconta aux voleurs qu'elle était la fille d'un riche roi pour les convaincre de l'emmener avec eux. Les voleurs, intrigués, la conduisirent à leur cachette. À mesure qu'ils passaient du temps ensemble, Tiffany les aida à apprendre à lire et écrire. Mais les voleurs découvrirent la vérité : Tiffany n'était pas une princesse, mais une orpheline qui avait peur d'aller à l'orphelinat.\\n\\nSur le chemin de l'orphelinat, Tiffany rencontra deux autres enfants perdus. Ils lui racontèrent que la méchante tante obligeait les enfants à travailler dur. Tiffany découvrit le secret de la tante : elle stockait plein de pâtisseries faites par les enfants. Quand la tante essaya de la punir, les trois voleurs revinrent aider Tiffany. Dans un moment fou, la tante tomba dans sa machine à pâtisseries et disparut.\\n\\nLes voleurs décidèrent d’utiliser leur richesse pour acheter l’orphelinat. Ils en firent un endroit chaleureux où tous les enfants sans famille pouvaient vivre heureux. Grâce à Tiffany et aux trois voleurs, l’orphelinat devint un joli village où tout le monde vivait en paix.

Coproduit par les studios Disney, il est le premier long m\\u00e9trage d'animation en images de synth\\u00e8se des studios Pixar. Le sc\\u00e9nario, \\u00e9labor\\u00e9 par Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen et Alec Sokolow, est bas\\u00e9 sur une histoire originale de John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton et Joe Ranft.\\n Le film met en sc\\u00e8ne un groupe de jouets. Woody, une poup\\u00e9e repr\\u00e9sentant un cow-boy, et Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, une figurine d'astronaute, en sont les personnages principaux.\\n Toy Story a produit pr\\u00e8s de 362\\u00a0millions de dollars de recettes dans le monde. Il a re\\u00e7u des critiques tr\\u00e8s positives qui saluent \\u00e0 la fois l'innovation technique de l'animation et la qualit\\u00e9 du sc\\u00e9nario. Depuis 2005 \\u2014 sa premi\\u00e8re ann\\u00e9e d'\\u00e9ligibilit\\u00e9 \\u2014, il fait partie du National Film Registry.\\n En plus des sorties DVD, de nombreux produits d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9s sont apparus sur le march\\u00e9\\u00a0: jouets, jeux vid\\u00e9o, attractions,\\u00a0etc.\\n Le film a fait l'objet de trois suites au cin\\u00e9ma\\u00a0: Toy Story 2 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 \\u00e0 nouveau par John Lasseter en 1999, Toy Story 3 de Lee Unkrich en 2010[NB 1], et Toy Story 4 de Josh Cooley en 2019.\\n La franchise comprend aussi une s\\u00e9rie t\\u00e9l\\u00e9vis\\u00e9e d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9e, Les Aventures de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair (2000-2001) dont Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, le film\\u00a0: Le D\\u00e9but des aventures, long-m\\u00e9trage directement sorti en vid\\u00e9o en 2000, constitue le prologue. Un film d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9, Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, est sorti en salles en 2022.\\n On peut \\u00e9galement retrouver les personnages de Toy Story dans les Toy Story Toons, qui sont trois courts m\\u00e9trages\\u00a0: Vacances \\u00e0 Hawa\\u00ef (2011), Mini Buzz (2011) et Rex, le roi de la f\\u00eate (2012), mais aussi dans deux moyens m\\u00e9trages\\u00a0: Toy Story\\u00a0: Angoisse au motel (2013) et Toy Story\\u00a0: Hors du temps (2014).\\n Dans la chambre d'Andy, ses jouets se mettent \\u00e0 vivre leur propre vie d\\u00e8s qu'il sort de la pi\\u00e8ce. Le jour de son anniversaire, quelques jours avant le d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement de sa famille, c'est la panique puisque chacun craint d'\\u00eatre remplac\\u00e9 par un jouet neuf. Woody le cow-boy est le jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9 du jeune gar\\u00e7on et n'appr\\u00e9hende donc pas tellement cette f\\u00eate. Mais Andy re\\u00e7oit une figurine articul\\u00e9e d'astronaute, Buzz l'\\u00c9clair (\\u00ab\\u00a0Buzz Lightyear\\u00a0\\u00bb en version originale et qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9coise). Tr\\u00e8s vite, il s'av\\u00e8re que Woody a \\u00ab\\u00a0perdu sa place\\u00a0\\u00bb de jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9, au profit de Buzz. Il essaie toutefois d'accueillir Buzz dans le groupe des jouets d'Andy, mais l'astronaute ne sait pas qu'il est un jouet, mais pense qu'il est un Ranger de l'espace, employ\\u00e9 par Star Command et ennemi du terrible empereur Zurg. Il pense aussi qu'il peut voler, ce que Woody conteste. Apr\\u00e8s une \\u00ab\\u00a0d\\u00e9monstration\\u00a0\\u00bb devant les jouets, ceux-ci l'applaudissent, \\u00e0 l'exception de Woody, qui \\u00ab\\u00a0n'appelle pas \\u00e7a voler\\u00a0\\u00bb mais plut\\u00f4t \\u00ab\\u00a0tomber avec panache\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n Alors qu'Andy se pr\\u00e9pare pour aller \\u00e0 Pizza Plan\\u00e8te (\\u00ab\\u00a0Pizza Planet\\u00a0\\u00bb en version originale et qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9coise), sa m\\u00e8re lui dit qu'il ne peut prendre qu'un seul jouet. Woody essaie alors de se d\\u00e9barrasser de Buzz en le faisant tomber dans un coin inaccessible de la chambre, mais \\u00e9choue et Buzz se retrouve projet\\u00e9 \\u00e0 travers la fen\\u00eatre. Les autres jouets commencent alors \\u00e0 penser que Woody, jaloux, a essay\\u00e9 de tuer Buzz. Quant \\u00e0 Andy, ne trouvant plus Buzz, il s'empare de Woody pour aller \\u00e0 Pizza Planet. Buzz voit soudain Andy aller dans la voiture de sa m\\u00e8re avec Woody et grimpe dans le v\\u00e9hicule pour se venger de ce dernier. Lors d'un arr\\u00eat \\u00e0 une station-service, les deux jouets rivaux se battent, quittent m\\u00eame la voiture de la m\\u00e8re d'Andy, qui repart finalement sans eux.\\n Woody trouve un camion Pizza Planet et pr\\u00e9voit alors de monter dedans pour rejoindre Andy. Mais, redoutant le regard des autres jouets s'il revient seul, il demande \\u00e0 Buzz de venir avec lui. Arriv\\u00e9s \\u00e0 destination, les deux jouets finissent dans une machine attrape-peluche, o\\u00f9 Sid, le voisin d'Andy, connu pour \\u00eatre un destructeur de jouets, les capture.\\n Buzz et Woody essaient d\\u00e9sormais de s'enfuir de la maison de Sid avant le d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement d'Andy. Cette maison renferme de nombreux jouets inqui\\u00e9tants ainsi que Scud, le chien m\\u00e9chant de Sid. Buzz voit alors une publicit\\u00e9 pour la gamme de jouets Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, ce qui le choque profond\\u00e9ment. Il veut se prouver qu'il peut voler, mais n'y arrive pas et se casse un bras. D\\u00e9prim\\u00e9, Buzz se sent incapable de participer au plan d'\\u00e9vasion de Woody. Ce dernier essaie d'obtenir l'aide des jouets d'Andy, situ\\u00e9s dans la maison d'en face\\u00a0; mais ceux-ci lui en veulent toujours d'avoir essay\\u00e9 d'\\u00e9carter Buzz. En revanche, les jouets de Sid viennent en aide \\u00e0 Woody en refixant le bras de Buzz, qui se fait ensuite martyriser par Sid. Woody organise alors, avec les jouets de Sid, un plan de sauvetage de Buzz. Mais m\\u00eame apr\\u00e8s tous ces efforts, les deux jouets ne parviennent pas \\u00e0 rattraper la voiture de la m\\u00e8re d'Andy partie pour le d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement.\\n Ils s'accrochent alors au camion de d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement mais sont poursuivis par Scud. En sauvant Woody du chien, Buzz est \\u00e9ject\\u00e9 du camion. Woody essaie de le sauver avec la voiture t\\u00e9l\\u00e9guid\\u00e9e d'Andy, mais les autres jouets ne lui font pas confiance et il est jet\\u00e9 par-dessus bord. Les jouets comprennent leur erreur lorsqu'ils aper\\u00e7oivent Woody et Buzz sur la voiture t\\u00e9l\\u00e9guid\\u00e9e et les aident alors \\u00e0 les ramener sur le camion\\u00a0; mais les piles de la voiture sont \\u00e9puis\\u00e9es et les deux h\\u00e9ros sont oblig\\u00e9s d'allumer la fus\\u00e9e qu'avait fix\\u00e9e Sid sur le dos de Buzz pour d\\u00e9coller. Finalement, la voiture t\\u00e9l\\u00e9guid\\u00e9e rejoint les autres jouets dans le camion et Buzz et Woody rejoignent Andy dans la voiture. La famille et tous les jouets d'Andy arrivent finalement \\u00e0 bon port dans la nouvelle maison. Chaque jouet est \\u00e0 sa place et chacun s'en trouve heureux.\\n Au No\\u00ebl suivant, la s\\u0153ur d'Andy re\\u00e7oit une Madame Patate tandis qu'Andy re\\u00e7oit un v\\u00e9ritable petit chien, ce qui ne rassure pas la tribu des jouets.\\n \\u00a0Sauf indication contraire ou compl\\u00e9mentaire, les informations mentionn\\u00e9es dans cette section peuvent \\u00eatre confirm\\u00e9es par la base de donn\\u00e9es IMDb.\\n \\u00a0Source et l\\u00e9gende\\u00a0: version qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9coise (VQ) sur Doublage.qc.ca\\n \\u00c0 la fin des ann\\u00e9es 1970, John Lasseter entre aux Studios Disney comme animateur et participe \\u00e0 la production de Rox et Rouky (1981). C'est \\u00e0 cette p\\u00e9riode que remonte sa premi\\u00e8re exp\\u00e9rience dans le domaine de l'animation par ordinateur. Deux de ses amis lui font d\\u00e9couvrir la sc\\u00e8ne du Light Cycle, issue du film Tron (1982)[NB 2]. Cette exp\\u00e9rience est une r\\u00e9v\\u00e9lation qui le sensibilise aux possibilit\\u00e9s offertes par l'animation par ordinateur. Lasseter travaille ensuite pour la division Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Group de Lucasfilm Ltd. qui, vendue par George Lucas \\u00e0 Steve Jobs, deviendra Pixar Animation Studios en 1986.\\n Le court-m\\u00e9trage oscaris\\u00e9 Tin Toy (1988) r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 par Lasseter permet \\u00e0 Pixar d'esp\\u00e9rer pouvoir r\\u00e9aliser son premier long m\\u00e9trage mais, comme le studio r\\u00e9alise une perte nette de 8,3\\u00a0millions de $ en 1990, il doit chercher un partenaire financier. La soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 se s\\u00e9pare le 30 avril 1990 de sa division de mat\\u00e9riel informatique.\\n Au d\\u00e9but des ann\\u00e9es 1990, le studio Disney cherche de nouvelles formes d'animation comme l'animation en volume (L'\\u00c9trange No\\u00ebl de monsieur Jack de Henry Selick, 1993) et \\u00e0 am\\u00e9liorer ses techniques de production avec par exemple le projet informatis\\u00e9 CAPS, collaboration entre les deux soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9s, mais aussi \\u00e0 produire un film en images de synth\\u00e8se. Disney a d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 fait quelques utilisations de l'informatique comme dans La Belle et la B\\u00eate (1991). Ces \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments permettent \\u00e0 Disney et Pixar de se rapprocher. Bien que Lasseter soit un ancien de Disney, il pr\\u00e9f\\u00e8re rester chez Pixar et lancer un projet commun.\\n C'est dans le cadre du projet CAPS qu'au d\\u00e9but de l'\\u00e9t\\u00e9 1990, \\u00e0 l'approche de la fin de la production de Bernard et Bianca au pays des kangourous (1990), l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar apprend l'int\\u00e9r\\u00eat de Disney pour une collaboration.\\n Les premi\\u00e8res discussions commencent entre Ed Catmull, Avy Ray Smith et Peter Schneider, pr\\u00e9sident de Walt Disney Feature Animation. Apr\\u00e8s quelques rencontres entre les membres de Pixar et ceux de Disney, c'est Jeffrey Katzenberg, le pr\\u00e9sident du studio Disney, qui prend en main les n\\u00e9gociations. Pixar propose une \\u00e9mission sp\\u00e9ciale d'une demi-heure nomm\\u00e9e A Tin Toy Christmas, pour gagner en exp\\u00e9rience. Mais Katzenberg refuse cette proposition et autorise l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar, lors de leur r\\u00e9union au sein du studio Disney, \\u00e0 rencontrer les animateurs Disney pour les aider \\u00e0 faire non pas un moyen m\\u00e9trage mais un long m\\u00e9trage. Les discussions se poursuivent et aboutissent en mars 1991 \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9criture d'un contrat pour un long m\\u00e9trage bas\\u00e9 sur les personnages de Tin Toy, appel\\u00e9 Toy Story,.\\n Le 3 mai 1991, les deux parties s'accordent sur les termes du contrat, sign\\u00e9 d\\u00e9but juillet. Le journal The Hollywood Reporter r\\u00e9v\\u00e8le l'information le 12 juillet 1991\\u00a0; le contrat pr\\u00e9voit alors aussi deux autres films, aux noms pour le moment ind\\u00e9termin\\u00e9s, en contrepartie de quoi Pixar percevra 10\\u00a0% des b\\u00e9n\\u00e9fices,. Mais le contrat est beaucoup plus pr\\u00e9cis, il comporte plusieurs clauses dont la possibilit\\u00e9 pour Disney d'arr\\u00eater \\u00e0 tout moment le projet (Pixar recevant 350\\u00a0000\\u00a0USD en compensation) ou de r\\u00e9\\u00e9crire son propre sc\\u00e9nario si celui de Pixar ne leur convient pas, et accorde \\u00e0 Disney la totalit\\u00e9 des droits de toutes les productions d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9es. Une autre concerne les producteurs.\\n Le projet permet \\u00e0 Disney de profiter de l'avance de Pixar dans l'image de synth\\u00e8se, tandis que Pixar utilise l'exp\\u00e9rience de Disney dans la production de longs m\\u00e9trages. Le projet commence chez Pixar avec Edwin Catmull (pr\\u00e9sident), John Lasseter, Ralph Guggenheim (producteur) et Bill Reeves (directeur technique). Leur premi\\u00e8re t\\u00e2che a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 de r\\u00e9aliser un film de 30\\u00a0secondes pour tester la technologie. L'\\u00e9quipe, simplement 10\\u00a0personnes dans l'arri\\u00e8re boutique d'un constructeur de mat\\u00e9riel informatique, s'\\u00e9toffe rapidement avec l'arriv\\u00e9e de Peter Docter et Andrew Stanton.\\n Le concept de base du film est d'imaginer l'empilement des jouets d'une chambre d'enfant prendre vie. Selon Lasseter\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Cette chambre est un microcosme urbain, un melting pot pas si emm\\u00eal\\u00e9\\u00a0\\u00bb. En suivant ce concept, la principale t\\u00e2che de l'\\u00e9quipe de production a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 de retrouver l'essence physique et conceptuelle de chaque jouet, sa (ses) mati\\u00e8re(s), ses textures, ses limitations techniques et en fonction de ces contraintes d'imaginer un caract\\u00e8re, une personnalit\\u00e9. Toutefois c'est d'abord \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9quipe du sc\\u00e9nario de chercher une histoire forte et inoubliable.\\n Un premier sc\\u00e9nario arrive rapidement \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9t\\u00e9 1991, mais Katzenberg le rejette car les personnages voulaient la m\\u00eame chose pour les m\\u00eames raisons. Au d\\u00e9part, le premier jouet devait \\u00eatre Tinny, h\\u00e9ros de Tin Toy, mais ce musicien m\\u00e9canique dans son uniforme rouge \\u00e9tait muet et \\u00ab\\u00a0trop vieillot\\u00a0\\u00bb pour devenir le personnage principal,. Une version interm\\u00e9diaire selon Stanton \\u00e9tait con\\u00e7ue comme la nouvelle de Rip Van Winkle, un jouet se r\\u00e9veille sur le bord d'une route et part \\u00e0 la recherche de ses propri\\u00e9taires, c'\\u00e9tait l'id\\u00e9e retenue pour l'\\u00e9mission A Tin Toy Christmas.\\n \\nIl propose alors \\u00e0 Lasseter de faire un buddy movie et de s'inspirer de films comme 48 heures (1982) et La Cha\\u00eene (1958), des films centr\\u00e9s sur deux personnages qui malgr\\u00e9 leur opposition doivent coop\\u00e9rer, gagnant un respect mutuel.  \\u00ab\\u00a0C\\u2019est un genre que personne n\\u2019avait r\\u00e9ellement explor\\u00e9 dans le domaine de l\\u2019animation. Nous y avons vu un grand potentiel pour r\\u00e9aliser un film avec des personnages forts. L\\u2019id\\u00e9e de base d\\u2019un \\u00ab\\u00a0buddy movie\\u00a0\\u00bb, c\\u2019est de mettre en sc\\u00e8ne deux personnages aux caract\\u00e8res r\\u00e9solument oppos\\u00e9s et de les placer dans une situation qui les oblige \\u00e0 collaborer et \\u00e0 se remettre en cause. Cela permet de traduire \\u00e0 l\\u2019image toutes les \\u00e9tapes de leur \\u00e9volution, et cela offre de grandes possibilit\\u00e9s en termes d\\u2019interpr\\u00e9tation.\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0John Lasseter Une nouvelle version du sc\\u00e9nario, \\u00e9crite par Lasseter, Stanton et Docter, est pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9e en septembre 1991 avec Tinny et une marionnette de ventriloque du genre Charlie McCarthy et ayant appartenu au p\\u00e8re d'Andy. L'id\\u00e9e au centre de l'histoire est la confrontation de deux personnages qui d\\u00e9veloppent petit \\u00e0 petit une amiti\\u00e9,. Cette relation entre un ancien et un nouveau jouet permet d'explorer des territoires complexes en \\u00e9motions. La cr\\u00e9ation des personnages principaux, \\u00e0 savoir l'ancien et le nouveau jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9 d'Andy, n'a pas \\u00e9t\\u00e9 ais\\u00e9e.\\n Tinny est ensuite remplac\\u00e9 par une figurine militaire de type G.I. Joe, jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9 de Lasseter, avant de se doter d'un th\\u00e8me spatial, d'apr\\u00e8s le jouet des ann\\u00e9es 1960 Major Matt Mason. De plus, la soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Hasbro a refus\\u00e9 l'usage du G.I. Joe, mais a autoris\\u00e9 celui de M.\\u00a0Patate,. Selon le magazine EW, le refus \\u00e9tait motiv\\u00e9 par la mauvaise image donn\\u00e9e par un personnage G.I. Joe attach\\u00e9 \\u00e0 un p\\u00e9tard M-80, m\\u00eame renomm\\u00e9 Combat Carl. Tinny est alors rebaptis\\u00e9 Lunar Larry puis Tempus from Morph.\\n Les personnages devant s'opposer mais partager des traits communs, afin d'avoir un meilleur sc\\u00e9nario autour de l'astronaute, l'ancien jouet est alors devenu un cow-boy, les deux genres cherchant \\u00e0 conqu\\u00e9rir une fronti\\u00e8re. Il est baptis\\u00e9 Woody d'apr\\u00e8s l'acteur afro-am\\u00e9ricain Woody Strode mais reste une marionnette de ventriloque. Les deux personnages Woody et Tempus sont pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9s en juin 1992 \\u00e0 Disney dans un test de 30\\u00a0secondes. Mais comme Disney souhaite que le film vise \\u00e0 la fois un public jeune et un public adulte, la compagnie demande \\u00e0 revoir les personnalit\\u00e9s de Woody et Tempus et que des r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences pour adultes soient ajout\\u00e9es. Un des probl\\u00e8mes de Woody est que les marionnettes de ventriloque ont r\\u00e9cemment \\u00e9t\\u00e9 associ\\u00e9es aux films d'horreur. Lasseter se base alors sur une poup\\u00e9e de Casper le gentil fant\\u00f4me, munie d'une ficelle pour la voix, pour transformer Woody, r\\u00e9duisant en plus sa taille, tr\\u00e8s proche de celle de Tempus et permettant un meilleur antagonisme. Woody a conserv\\u00e9 une trace de la poup\\u00e9e de ventriloque avec sa corde parlante. Le reste de la personnalit\\u00e9 de Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 d\\u00e9velopp\\u00e9 sur l'acteur choisi pour lui pr\\u00eater sa voix (voir ci-apr\\u00e8s). L'ajout de ce personnage spatial, bri\\u00e8vement nomm\\u00e9 Buzz the spaceman, modifie le sc\\u00e9nario. Finalement le personnage spatial est baptis\\u00e9 Buzz Lightyear (Buzz l'\\u00c9clair), en r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 l'astronaute Buzz Aldrin.\\n Dans les premiers sc\\u00e9narios, le lieu de d\\u00e9tente de la famille \\u00e9tait une combinaison entre une pizzeria et un golf miniature, avec des sc\\u00e8nes comiques autour des \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments du golf. Ce n'est qu'avec l'arriv\\u00e9e de Buzz qu'il se transforme en quelque chose qui peut \\u00e9voquer un spatioport, la pizzeria Pizza Planet, m\\u00e9lange de diner des ann\\u00e9es 1950, d'une salle d'arcade des ann\\u00e9es 1990 et d'un fast-food au d\\u00e9cor de science-fiction. Les plans du restaurant et de sa salle de jeu sont si d\\u00e9taill\\u00e9s qu'ils auraient pu \\u00eatre construits pour de vrai, l'\\u00e9quipe charg\\u00e9e de les concevoir ayant travaill\\u00e9 comme des architectes. En octobre 1992, Joe Ranft rejoint Pixar et aide au d\\u00e9veloppement du sc\\u00e9nario.\\n Le nouveau sc\\u00e9nario de Toy Story est fortement influenc\\u00e9 par les id\\u00e9es du sc\\u00e9nariste Robert McKee, et conna\\u00eet de nombreuses modifications avant d'\\u00eatre finalis\\u00e9. Le sc\\u00e9nario initial est l'\\u0153uvre de Lasseter, Schneider, Schumacher, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter et Joe Ranft, ancien de chez Disney. Comme son contrat l'autorise, Disney fait appel \\u00e0 Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow et, plus tard, Whedon, pour aider le d\\u00e9veloppement du sc\\u00e9nario,.\\n Au bout d'une ann\\u00e9e de production, la productrice Bonnie Arnold vient aider Guggenheim, apportant son exp\\u00e9rience des films d'action comme Danse avec les loups (1990). Son arriv\\u00e9e pr\\u00e9vue par le contrat de juillet 1990 \\u00e9tait un souhait de Disney d'avoir deux producteurs, Guggenheim c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 Pixar et Arnold c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 Disney. Le duo a con\\u00e7u un syst\\u00e8me budg\\u00e9taire pour assurer la productivit\\u00e9 du studio Pixar. Du c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 de chez Disney, Kathleen Gavin assure la coordination des projets sp\\u00e9ciaux en tant que vice-pr\\u00e9sidente, ayant d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 coproduit L'\\u00c9trange No\\u00ebl de monsieur Jack.\\n Joss Whedon vient aider \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9criture du sc\\u00e9nario durant quelques mois avant qu'il soit connu comme le cr\\u00e9ateur de la s\\u00e9rie Buffy contre les vampires (d\\u00e9but\\u00e9e en 1997). Whedon avait propos\\u00e9 de faire de Barbie un personnage qui sauverait Woody et Buzz \\u00e0 la fin du film, dans un tenue de commando \\u00e0 l'image de Sarah Connor dans Terminator 2\\u00a0: Le Jugement dernier, \\u00e9l\\u00e9ment qu'il avait d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 imagin\\u00e9 en 1992 pour le film Buffy, tueuse de vampires,. L'id\\u00e9e fut abandonn\\u00e9e apr\\u00e8s le refus de Mattel, propri\\u00e9taire de la licence Barbie. Le producteur Ralph Guggenheim a d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que Mattel n'avait pas accept\\u00e9 l'utilisation de Barbie dans le film car \\u00ab\\u00a0Mattel pense que les filles qui jouent avec des poup\\u00e9es Barbie projettent leurs personnalit\\u00e9s sur la poup\\u00e9e. Si vous donnez \\u00e0 la poup\\u00e9e une voix et que vous l'animez, vous lui donnez une personnalit\\u00e9 qui ne correspond pas \\u00e0 l'id\\u00e9al de chaque petite fille\\u00a0\\u00bb. Les poup\\u00e9es Barbie appara\\u00eetront, cependant, dans les suites du film, Toy Story 2 et Toy Story 3.\\n Disney a donn\\u00e9 officiellement son feu vert pour le film le 19 janvier 1993, date \\u00e0 laquelle le casting des voix a pu commencer,.\\n Lasseter avait toujours voulu que Tom Hanks soit la voix originale de Woody, affirmant que Hanks \\u00ab\\u00a0a la capacit\\u00e9 de prendre des sentiments et de les rendre \\u00e9mouvants\\u00a0\\u00bb,. M\\u00eame si le personnage, comme celui de Une \\u00e9quipe hors du commun (1992) est pauvre et m\\u00e9prisable.\\u00a0\\u00bb De rapides s\\u00e9ances de test, utilisant la voix de Hanks dans Turner et Hooch (1989), ont convaincu ce dernier de signer pour le film,.\\n Billy Crystal a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 approch\\u00e9 pour la voix de Buzz mais a refus\\u00e9 le r\\u00f4le, ce qu'il a ensuite regrett\\u00e9, bien qu'il ait quelques ann\\u00e9es plus tard jou\\u00e9 la voix originale de Bob Razowski dans un autre succ\\u00e8s de Pixar, Monstres et Cie (2001),. Katzenberg propose alors le r\\u00f4le \\u00e0 Tim Allen, d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 apparu dans la s\\u00e9rie t\\u00e9l\\u00e9vis\\u00e9e Papa bricole, et celui-ci accepte apr\\u00e8s une session de test faite \\u00e0 D\\u00e9troit.\\n Toy Story est le premier r\\u00f4le dans un film d'animation \\u00e0 la fois pour Hanks et pour Allen.\\n Lasseter voulait que Don Rickles fasse la voix de M.\\u00a0Patate. Afin de le persuader, Lasseter, Thomas Schumacher et quelques personnes lui ont rendu visite avec une figurine de M.\\u00a0Patate. Par accident, Lasseter a fait tomber le chapeau melon de la figurine qui, sans cet accessoire, avait une forte ressemblance avec Rickles, chauve. Cet incident a permis de d\\u00e9tendre l'atmosph\\u00e8re et finalement Rickles a accept\\u00e9. La recherche de l'acteur pour Zigzag a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 plus longue car l'\\u00e9quipe cherchait un acteur avec un accent ironique. Ne parvenant pas \\u00e0 trouver ce qu'ils voulaient, un jour Schumacher proposa de changer d'optique et d'avoir un accent rural, ce que l'acteur Jim Varney repr\\u00e9sentait assez bien. Ce dernier accepta. Ce choix a par la suite oblig\\u00e9 les \\u00e9quipes artistiques \\u00e0 modifier l\\u00e9g\\u00e8rement Zigzag (voir ci-apr\\u00e8s).\\n Lasseter ne voulait pas faire de Toy Story un film musical comme l'ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 les pr\\u00e9c\\u00e9dentes productions de Disney telles que La Petite Sir\\u00e8ne (1989), Aladdin ou Le Roi lion. Initialement, Disney avait toutefois voulu privil\\u00e9gier le format musical, faisant valoir que \\u00ab\\u00a0Nous suivons la voie des films musicaux. Les personnages qui se mettent \\u00e0 chanter constituent un raccourci important\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n Disney et Pixar sont finalement parvenus \\u00e0 un accord respectant le choix de Lasseter\\u00a0: pas de com\\u00e9die musicale et pas de personnage qui chante, mais des musiques accompagnant et soulignant l'action. Chris Montan, responsable musical chez Disney depuis le milieu des ann\\u00e9es 1980, contacte Randy Newman pour lui demander d'\\u00e9crire les chansons de Toy Story. Ce dernier n'avait alors jamais compos\\u00e9 de musique pour un film d'animation. Lasseter a d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que \\u00ab\\u00a0Ses musiques sont \\u00e9mouvantes, profondes et satiriques, il apportera une touche \\u00e9motionnelle \\u00e0 chaque sc\\u00e8ne\\u00a0\\u00bb. Newman accepte et pr\\u00e9sente sa premi\\u00e8re composition, Je suis ton ami, le 26 mars 1993 \\u00e0 Lasseter, Guggenheim, Arnold et Montan au si\\u00e8ge de Disney \\u00e0 Burbank. Newman a compos\\u00e9 la chanson phare du film Je suis ton ami (ou T'as trouv\\u00e9 un ami au Qu\\u00e9bec et You've Got a Friend in Me en version originale) en un jour. La chanson la plus difficile \\u00e0 composer selon Newman a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 I Will Go Sailing No More (Jamais plus je ne volerai) en raison du changement de sentiment \\u00e0 rendre en plein milieu, passant \\u00ab\\u00a0d'une lamentation plaintive et mordante \\u00e0 un cri de d\\u00e9fi.\\nLa version fran\\u00e7aise quant \\u00e0 elle, est compos\\u00e9e de onze chansons instrumentales, trois versions fran\\u00e7aises interpr\\u00e9t\\u00e9es par Charl\\u00c9lie Couture et d'une chanson dans sa version originale en anglais.\\n Pixar pr\\u00e9sente un avant-projet du film \\u00e0 Disney le 19 novembre 1993,. Le r\\u00e9sultat est d\\u00e9sastreux car Woody est pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9 comme un \\u00ab\\u00a0imb\\u00e9cile sarcastique\\u00a0\\u00bb, un personnage insupportable. Le pr\\u00e9sident de Walt Disney Feature Animation, Peter Schneider, arr\\u00eate imm\\u00e9diatement la production en attendant qu'un nouveau sc\\u00e9nario soit pr\\u00e9par\\u00e9 et approuv\\u00e9 par Disney. Steve Daly mentionne une r\\u00e9union similaire tenue par Joe Ranft en date du 17 novembre 1993 avec le m\\u00eame r\\u00e9sultat. Il pr\\u00e9cise que l'animation avait d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 commenc\\u00e9 et a d\\u00fb \\u00eatre arr\\u00eat\\u00e9e.\\n Dans cette version, Woody trompe les autres jouets et crie sur Zigzag, pousse intentionnellement Buzz, le m\\u00e8ne vers le jardin de Sid. Lasseter demande alors \\u00e0 Disney d'attendre un peu le temps de modifier le sc\\u00e9nario afin d'\\u00e9viter de devoir licencier toute l'\\u00e9quipe de production chez Pixar et que le studio Disney produise le film seul. Pixar parvient \\u00e0 survivre \\u00e0 cet arr\\u00eat en se repliant sur ses anciennes activit\\u00e9s en attendant que le sc\\u00e9nario soit r\\u00e9\\u00e9crit,.\\n Le nouveau sc\\u00e9nario fait de Woody un personnage plus sympathique, gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 la pr\\u00e9sence du sc\\u00e9nariste et v\\u00e9t\\u00e9ran de l'animation Joe Ranft. Par exemple c'est une lampe Luxo (non vivante), en hommage \\u00e0 Luxo Jr., qui fait tomber Buzz et non Woody. Le film est allong\\u00e9 avec une introduction dans laquelle on voit Andy jouer avec Woody pour apporter plus de sentiments. Pour des besoins de r\\u00e9alisme, ou une \\u00ab\\u00a0cr\\u00e9dibilit\\u00e9 \\u00e9motionnelle\\u00a0\\u00bb selon Steve Daly, du film, de nombreux \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments secondaires ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s, le meilleur exemple \\u00e9tant la publicit\\u00e9 pour Buzz l'\\u00c9clair.\\n Katzenberg red\\u00e9marre alors la production en f\\u00e9vrier 1994,. Aucun employ\\u00e9 n'a donc \\u00e9t\\u00e9 licenci\\u00e9. Les acteurs ont d\\u00fb revenir en mars pour enregistrer les textes du nouveau sc\\u00e9nario. Mais Katzenberg refuse que le titre final du film comporte le terme Toy (\\u00ab\\u00a0jouet\\u00a0\\u00bb) par peur de repousser le public adolescent. En raison de d\\u00e9saccords avec Michael Eisner, alors PDG de Disney, Jeffrey Katzenberg quitte Disney et son rempla\\u00e7ant ne s'oppose pas \\u00e0 l'usage du titre Toy Story.\\n Entre le d\\u00e9but de la production et 1994, l'\\u00e9quipe de 24\\u00a0personnes a grossi pour atteindre 110\\u00a0personnes,. En comparaison, Le Roi lion, sorti en 1994, avait un budget de 45\\u00a0millions de dollars et une \\u00e9quipe de 800\\u00a0personnes. David Price d\\u00e9taille ainsi l'\\u00e9quipe\\u00a0: 27\\u00a0animateurs, 22\\u00a0directeurs techniques, 61\\u00a0artistes et ing\\u00e9nieurs. Mais de nombreux artistes \\u00e9taient en r\\u00e9alit\\u00e9 employ\\u00e9s par une soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 commune \\u00e0 Disney et Pixar nomm\\u00e9e Hi Tech Toons.\\n Durant la production, l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar a fait le choix de ne pas reproduire la r\\u00e9alit\\u00e9 en cherchant \\u00e0 en faire une r\\u00e9plique exacte mais de cr\\u00e9er un monde hyperr\\u00e9el. Lasseter a dit \\u00e0 propos du d\\u00e9fi que repr\\u00e9sentait l'animation par ordinateur\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Chaque feuille et chaque brin d'herbe ont d\\u00fb \\u00eatre cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s.\\u00a0\\u00bb Ce principe est compr\\u00e9hensible avec l'exemple des soldats en plastique. Bien qu'ils ne bougent ni comme de vrais soldats ni comme les jouets en plastique qu'un enfant manipule, ils agissent comme des soldats en plastique vivants. Lui et son \\u00e9quipe avaient pour souci majeur de rendre les jouets authentiques et vivants\\u00a0:\\n \\u00ab\\u00a0La qualit\\u00e9 du jeu des personnages de Toy Story parvient \\u00e0 vous faire croire que les jouets sont vivants. Apr\\u00e8s avoir vu le film, vous ne regarderez plus jamais vos jouets ou ceux de vos enfants comme avant. Finalement, Toy Story n\\u2019est peut-\\u00eatre pas une histoire imaginaire...\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0Ralph Guggenheim, producteur du film L'organisation de l'\\u00e9quipe \\u00e9tait comme une cha\\u00eene de montage similaire \\u00e0 celle en vigueur chez Disney.\\n Le d\\u00e9partement artistique con\\u00e7oit les personnages, les d\\u00e9cors et tous les objets. La cr\\u00e9ation du film a commenc\\u00e9 gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 des storyboards anim\\u00e9s qui aidaient les 27\\u00a0animateurs travaillant sur le film \\u00e0 concevoir les personnages. L'animation par ordinateur de chaque personnage est pass\\u00e9e par une premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9tape, o\\u00f9 chaque personnage a soit \\u00e9t\\u00e9 cr\\u00e9\\u00e9 avec de la p\\u00e2te \\u00e0 modeler, soit \\u00e9t\\u00e9 mod\\u00e9lis\\u00e9 sur un sch\\u00e9ma dessin\\u00e9 \\u00e0 l'ordinateur.\\n Le service de la conception graphique dirig\\u00e9 par Ralph Eggleston et comprenant Bob Pauley, Bill Cone, Tia Kratter et Robin Cooper a eu la charge du niveau de d\\u00e9tail des sc\\u00e8nes, de la lumi\\u00e8re d'ambiance g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale au plus petit d\\u00e9tail des accessoires. Des d\\u00e9tails \\u00e0 peine visibles comme les rayures sur plinthes ou un r\\u00e9veil d\\u00e9r\\u00e9gl\\u00e9 et clignotant dans la chambre d'Andy ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 ajout\\u00e9s pour donner l'impression d'un monde r\\u00e9el.\\n Ces \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments sont mod\\u00e9lis\\u00e9s en 3D par l'un des directeurs techniques soit \\u00e0 partir d'un cahier des charges soit d'une sculpture pour les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments plus complexes (certains jouets ou les humains). Les mod\\u00e8les 3D sont agr\\u00e9ment\\u00e9s de contr\\u00f4les, ou variables d'animation, afin de d\\u00e9finir leurs mouvements et les cons\\u00e9quences d'un mouvement sur leur forme. Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 mod\\u00e9lis\\u00e9 par Bill Reeves et Buzz par Eben Ostby. Les cadreurs ont aussi \\u00e9t\\u00e9 charg\\u00e9s de redimensionner les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s par les artistes, parfois de cr\\u00e9er plusieurs versions d'un m\\u00eame mod\\u00e8le comme le bureau d'Andy dont les d\\u00e9tails du bois apparaissent quand Woody monte dessus.\\n Ensuite, le d\\u00e9partement artistique d\\u00e9finit une sc\\u00e8ne avec sa palette de couleurs et son \\u00e9clairage et le d\\u00e9partement du cadrage positionne les mod\\u00e8les dans la sc\\u00e8ne et les mouvements de cam\\u00e9ra. Il n'a fallu pas moins de neuf sources diff\\u00e9rentes de lumi\\u00e8re pour Woody lorsqu'il regarde par la fen\\u00eatre Buzz qui vient de tomber, en raison de l'heure, celle du coucher de soleil.\\n \\u00c0 plusieurs reprises, le film use de miroirs, de reflets et autres surfaces r\\u00e9fl\\u00e9chissantes (casque de Buzz, r\\u00e9troviseur,\\u00a0etc.). Ce rendu a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 obtenu gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 la cr\\u00e9ation d'un environnement mapp\\u00e9 dans un cube. Les images \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments de la sc\\u00e8ne sont projet\\u00e9es sur les faces int\\u00e9rieures d'un cube qui entoure les personnages\\u00a0; le miroir ne fait alors que r\\u00e9fl\\u00e9chir une des faces du cube sans \\u00eatre oblig\\u00e9 de recr\\u00e9er les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments.\\n La sc\\u00e8ne finale, une course poursuite pour rejoindre la voiture de la famille d'Andy, a n\\u00e9cessit\\u00e9 la cr\\u00e9ation d'un d\\u00e9cor tr\\u00e8s important. Pour simplifier leur t\\u00e2che, l'\\u00e9quipe a cr\\u00e9\\u00e9 un jeu de mod\\u00e8les r\\u00e9utilisables constitu\\u00e9 de 14\\u00a0maisons et 15\\u00a0terrains param\\u00e9trables en couleur, implantation et d\\u00e9cors de jardin, pour un total de 125\\u00a0d\\u00e9clinaisons.\\n Le d\\u00e9partement d'animation (3D) applique alors les principes de base de l'animation pour donner vie aux personnages. Une fois que les animateurs avaient le mod\\u00e8le d'un personnage, les articulations et les mouvements ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 cod\\u00e9s, permettant \\u00e0 chaque personnage de se d\\u00e9placer de diverses mani\\u00e8res, de parler, marcher ou sauter. Chaque articulation, avec le code qui lui est associ\\u00e9, est nomm\\u00e9e avar\\u00a0(en) (animation variable),. Une fois le personnage et ses avars cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s, les animateurs avaient souvent la charge de chercher \\u00e0 \\u00ab\\u00a0briser\\u00a0\\u00bb le personnage, pousser les avars \\u00e0 l'extr\\u00eame pour d\\u00e9tecter les \\u00e9ventuels bugs.\\n Chez Pixar, \\u00e0 l'inverse des habitudes[NB 3] de Disney, un animateur g\\u00e8re une sc\\u00e8ne en entier et non un personnage durant tout le film\\u00a0; toutefois, il y a quelques exceptions. Pour la sc\\u00e8ne dans la station service, Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 anim\\u00e9 par Mark Oftedal et Buzz par Guionne Leroy. L'animateur d\\u00e9finit des points cl\\u00e9s de l'animation, la machine g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rant les \\u00e9tapes interm\\u00e9diaires.\\n De tous les personnages, Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 le plus complexe puisqu'il a n\\u00e9cessit\\u00e9 la cr\\u00e9ation de 723\\u00a0mouvements possibles, dont 212 pour le visage et 58 pour la bouche,.\\n Lasseter a fait le choix de ne pas faire g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rer les mouvements des l\\u00e8vres. Pour synchroniser la voix des acteurs avec les personnages, les animateurs ont pass\\u00e9 une semaine par trame de 8\\u00a0secondes \\u00e0 repasser en d\\u00e9tail sur la bouche des personnages et sur leurs expressions.\\n Apr\\u00e8s cela, les animateurs ont compil\\u00e9 les sc\\u00e8nes et d\\u00e9velopp\\u00e9 un nouveau storyboard avec les personnages anim\\u00e9s par ordinateur. Les animateurs ont ensuite ajout\\u00e9 des ombres, de l'\\u00e9clairage, des effets visuels, et enfin \\u2014 gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 300\\u00a0processeurs informatiques \\u2014 ont donn\\u00e9 au film son apparence finale,. L'\\u00e9quipe responsable des textures, dirig\\u00e9e par Tom Porter, a utilis\\u00e9 l'outil de texturage de RenderMan, le RenderMan Shading Language. L'\\u00e9quipe responsable des \\u00e9clairages, la plus importante en nombre et dirig\\u00e9e par Galyn Susman et Sharon Calahan, a eu \\u00e0 sa disposition de nombreuses possibilit\\u00e9s techniques allant des \\u00e9clairages standards (vie courante), professionnels (cin\\u00e9ma) mais aussi des lumi\\u00e8res sans ombres, d'autres n'\\u00e9clairant qu'un seul objet ou encore des projecteurs d'ombres.\\n Afin de r\\u00e9aliser le rendu de Toy Story, Pixar a utilis\\u00e9 une ferme de serveurs, la Renderfarm. Le film a utilis\\u00e9 un affichage \\u00e0 la r\\u00e9solution de 1\\u00a0536 \\u00d7 922 pixels avec un pixel repr\\u00e9sentant un carr\\u00e9 d'un demi-centim\\u00e8tre pour un \\u00e9cran de salle de cin\\u00e9ma standard. Gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 l'utilisation de l'anticr\\u00e9nelage pour adoucir les traits, une r\\u00e9solution plus grande, estim\\u00e9e \\u00e0 plusieurs milliers de lignes, n'a pas \\u00e9t\\u00e9 n\\u00e9cessaire.\\n Au cours de la post-production, le film a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 envoy\\u00e9 \\u00e0 Skywalker Sound, o\\u00f9 les effets sonores ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 m\\u00e9lang\\u00e9s avec le th\\u00e8me musical. Une s\\u00e9ance de test en public a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9e \\u00e0 San Rafael en 1993.\\n L'apparence de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair est bas\\u00e9e sur les combinaisons port\\u00e9es par les astronautes du programme Apollo et les figurines G.I. Joe,. Sa mentalit\\u00e9 rigide et son inflexibilit\\u00e9, mais aussi sa force de caract\\u00e8re sont dus \\u00e0 la mati\\u00e8re qui le compose, du plastique rigide.\\n Le deuxi\\u00e8me personnage, initialement une poup\\u00e9e de ventriloque, a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 chang\\u00e9 en une poup\\u00e9e cow-boy, le sh\\u00e9rif Woody, nomm\\u00e9e d'apr\\u00e8s l'acteur am\\u00e9ricain de westerns Woody Strode. En apparence, Woody est tr\\u00e8s relax\\u00e9, d\\u00e9tendu, avec un aspect attachant et des valeurs qui nous poussent \\u00e0 avoir confiance en lui. Au contraire de Buzz, Woody n'a pas un moral d'acier\\u00a0; quand son mental flanche, son corps fait de m\\u00eame, c'est \\u00e0 relier au fait que c'est une poup\\u00e9e en tissu.\\n Plus de deux mille croquis de Woody et mille de Buzz ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 n\\u00e9cessaires avant d'aboutir aux personnages que l'on conna\\u00eet, choisis par John Lasseter. Graphiquement, les deux personnages ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 con\\u00e7us avant que Tim Allen et Tom Hanks ne donnent leurs voix\\u00a0; mais selon Bonnie Arnold, plus ils pr\\u00eataient leur voix, plus Buzz et Woody donnaient l'impression d'\\u00eatre Allen et Hanks. Finalement, Woody comprend plus de 1\\u00a0500 avars, bien plus que les 18 de Luxo Jr.\\n Le caract\\u00e8re m\\u00e9content de M.\\u00a0Patate est, comme l'explique Lasseter, d\\u00fb \\u00e0 son int\\u00e9grit\\u00e9 physique, les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments de son visage tombant \\u00e0 longueur de journ\\u00e9e, motif l\\u00e9gitime de m\\u00e9contentement. Ceci fait en plus un parall\\u00e8le avec l'expression am\\u00e9ricaine \\u00ab\\u00a0a chip on his shoulder\\u00a0\\u00bb qui d\\u00e9signe un m\\u00e9contentement, une rumination pour la personne qui doit porter \\u00ab\\u00a0une \\u00e9charde (chip) sur son \\u00e9paule\\u00a0\\u00bb, \\u00e9tant donn\\u00e9 que chip signifie \\u00e9galement \\u00ab\\u00a0tranche\\u00a0\\u00bb et que c'est de l\\u00e0 que vient le mot \\u00ab\\u00a0chips\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n La fragilit\\u00e9 de la poup\\u00e9e de porcelaine La Berg\\u00e8re induit la douce romance avec Woody et ses mouvements d\\u00e9licats, sinon elle casse. Pour Bayonne, comme on place souvent une tirelire en hauteur sur une \\u00e9tag\\u00e8re, il \\u00e9prouve un sentiment de sup\\u00e9riorit\\u00e9 et, en liaison avec l'expression \\u00ab\\u00a0two cents matters\\u00a0\\u00bb, pense avoir souvent raison. Techniquement les deux personnages sont identiques au niveau informatique, un assemblage de formes simples \\u00e0 la surface lisse mais gr\\u00e2ce au logiciel d'ombrage, qui g\\u00e8re la fa\\u00e7on dont une source lumineuse arrive sur une surface, la texture, la \\u00ab\\u00a0peau\\u00a0\\u00bb de Bayonne et celle de la Berg\\u00e8re sont totalement diff\\u00e9rentes.\\n Pour Rex, ses articulations peu nombreuses et limit\\u00e9es l'\\u00e9loignent des monstres de Jurassic Park (1993) ce qui le rend rigide mais aussi provoque son manque de confiance en lui. Sa pr\\u00e9sence dans le film \\u00e9tait justifi\\u00e9e par la forte popularit\\u00e9 des dinosaures et du Tyrannosaurus rex. Afin de renforcer le fait que ce soit un jouet, la texture de sa peau au niveau du cou se brise quand il tourne la t\\u00eate, qui comme c'est un jouet bouge d'un seul bloc. Zigzag, en raison de sa difficult\\u00e9 \\u00e0 se mouvoir par lui-m\\u00eame, a un caract\\u00e8re de suiveur. \\u00c0 l'origine con\\u00e7u comme un chien Jack Russell Terrier, joueur et nerveux, son aspect a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 modifi\\u00e9 avec le choix de l'acteur Jim Varney, ses oreilles ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 allong\\u00e9es, assouplies et d\\u00e9plac\\u00e9es du haut du cr\\u00e2ne vers le c\\u00f4t\\u00e9, ses yeux ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 mis en berne, son cou rapetiss\\u00e9 et il est devenu plus proche du chien de Saint-Hubert, comme Pluto.\\n Le colosse miniature avec des bras disproportionn\\u00e9s est appel\\u00e9 Rocky Gibraltar, c'est une figurine de catch. Pour animer les soldats en plastique, Pete Docter a demand\\u00e9 \\u00e0 une partie des artistes d'attacher chacun des vieilles chaussures \\u00e0 une planche et de marcher avec. Apr\\u00e8s plusieurs s\\u00e9ries de pas et sauts dans le hall du studio, les animateurs ont r\\u00e9ussi \\u00e0 imaginer les mouvements des soldats. De m\\u00eame, de nombreuses tentatives ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9es pour comprendre l'ouverture du parachute et les mouvements lors d'une descente du second \\u00e9tage d'un soldat parachutiste miniature suspendu par le casque.\\n Pour repr\\u00e9senter les humains, le d\\u00e9fi de l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 comparable \\u00e0 celui pour Blanche-Neige et les Sept Nains (1937) car personne n'avait encore r\\u00e9ussi \\u00e0 reproduire un humain convaincant, or il fallait ici en cr\\u00e9er quatre. Le premier personnage humain le plus approchant de ce que les animateurs voulaient \\u00e9tait le b\\u00e9b\\u00e9 dans Tin Toy. La difficult\\u00e9 provient surtout de la conjonction de la peau et des v\\u00eatements\\u00a0; ainsi, pour reproduire les mouvements du visage et du T-shirt de Sid, garde-robe qui ne d\\u00e9passe pas un total de 50\\u00a0$ (dans la vie r\\u00e9elle), il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 n\\u00e9cessaire \\u00ab\\u00a0d'afficher plus de lignes qu'un \\u00e9cran de contr\\u00f4le a\\u00e9rien\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n Le chien de Sid, Scud, est anim\\u00e9 gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 178 avars mais certains comme ceux des oreilles et de la queue ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 tr\\u00e8s souvent utilis\\u00e9s, au contraire de ceux des dents. Les jouets mutants, \\u00ab\\u00a0r\\u00e9par\\u00e9s\\u00a0\\u00bb par Sid, sont parmi les derniers \\u00e0 avoir \\u00e9t\\u00e9 con\\u00e7us et model\\u00e9s. Et pour beaucoup ils r\\u00e9utilisent des \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments con\\u00e7us pour les jouets d'Andy comme le torse de Rocky Gibraltar pour le mutant \\u00e0 t\\u00eate d'insecte ou le skateboard d'Andy en version miniature pour RollerBob.\\n Le budget initial fourni par Disney \\u00e9tait de 17,5\\u00a0millions d'USD avec une sortie pr\\u00e9vue pour 1994. Mais d\\u00e8s 1994, le budget de Disney atteint les 21,5\\u00a0millions, et 6\\u00a0millions sont encore n\\u00e9cessaires. De son c\\u00f4t\\u00e9, Steve Jobs, qui avait achet\\u00e9 Pixar pour 10\\u00a0millions d'USD, a investi plus de 50\\u00a0millions sans atteindre la rentabilit\\u00e9. Disney demande \\u00e0 Pixar de faire un cr\\u00e9dit de 3\\u00a0millions d'USD garanti sur les fonds personnels de Jobs. Steve Jobs tente de renflouer Pixar en faisant un partenariat avec Microsoft.\\n Finalement la cr\\u00e9ation du film a n\\u00e9cessit\\u00e9 un budget de 30\\u00a0millions de dollars. Avant la sortie du film, le producteur ex\\u00e9cutif du film Steve Jobs avait d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que \\u00ab\\u00a0Si Toy Story remporte un succ\\u00e8s mod\\u00e9r\\u00e9 \\u2014 disons 75\\u00a0millions de $ au box-office \\u2014 on [Pixar et Disney] atteindra le seuil de rentabilit\\u00e9. S'il en recueille 100\\u00a0millions, on gagnera de l'argent. Mais si c'est un vrai blockbuster et qu'il rapporte 200\\u00a0millions ou \\u00e0 peu pr\\u00e8s, on va se faire beaucoup d'argent.\\u00a0\\u00bb Le pr\\u00e9sident de Disney Michael Eisner avait lui d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que \\u00ab\\u00a0La technologie est brillante, les voix sont inspir\\u00e9es et je pense que l'histoire va toucher la corde sensible des gens. Croyez-moi, lorsqu'on a pour la premi\\u00e8re fois accept\\u00e9 de travailler ensemble, on ne pensait vraiment pas que leur premier film serait notre sortie de l'\\u00e9t\\u00e9 1995\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n En d\\u00e9cembre 1994, Guggenheim rencontre un directeur de Disney Consumer Products (DCP) et d\\u00e9couvre l'absence d'une gamme de produits d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9s. Cette absence \\u00e9tait due \\u00e0 un calendrier charg\\u00e9 en productions chez Disney, avec Pocahontas (1995) et Le Bossu de Notre-Dame (1996) ainsi qu'\\u00e0 une incompr\\u00e9hension, d'apr\\u00e8s laquelle Toy Story n'aurait pas de personnages originaux.\\n En janvier 1995, Peter Schneider annonce la sortie de Toy Story pour novembre 1995 ne laissant que la moiti\\u00e9 du temps habituel pour concevoir une gamme. De plus, Mattel et Hasbro d\\u00e9clinent l'offre de produire des jouets. Disney trouve un fabricant qui accepte de produire les jouets, Toy Fair, une soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 de Toronto avec une succursale en Chine nomm\\u00e9e Thinkway Toys, sp\\u00e9cialis\\u00e9e dans les tirelires parlantes. C'est aussi en janvier que Lasseter rencontre Albert Chan, propri\\u00e9taire de Thinkway et principal cr\\u00e9ateur. Chan propose une gamme de jouets bas\\u00e9e sur des figurines de 6\\u00a0pouces (15,2\\u00a0cm), moiti\\u00e9 moins que le format des G.I. Joe souhait\\u00e9 par Lasseter pour Buzz. Chan r\\u00e9pond que ce format ne se fait plus mais Lasseter insiste arguant que le public voudra les personnages du film. D\\u00e9but mars, Chan revient avec des figurines, 12\\u00a0pouces (30,5\\u00a0cm) pour Buzz et 15\\u00a0pouces (38,1\\u00a0cm) pour Woody et Lasseter l'emm\\u00e8ne dans une salle de projection du studio o\\u00f9 le film \\u00e9tait projet\\u00e9. Selon les souvenirs de Lasseter, les employ\\u00e9s du studio sont alors devenus hyst\\u00e9riques. Eben Osby, modeleur de Buzz, a bondi de son si\\u00e8ge, travers\\u00e9 la salle en courant pour prendre la figurine des mains de Lasseter. Mais les cha\\u00eenes de magasins n'ont pas partag\\u00e9 l'enthousiasme des employ\\u00e9s\\u00a0: Walmart ne commercialisa pas la figurine, Toys \\\"R\\\" Us et Disney Store n'ont eux command\\u00e9 pour les \\u00c9tats-Unis que 60\\u00a0000\\u00a0figurines de Buzz et 45\\u00a0000 de Woody. Lasseter demanda la cr\\u00e9ation de 250\\u00a0000\\u00a0figurines de chaque, mena\\u00e7ant de les produire \\u00e0 ses frais. Une semaine avant la sortie du film, ce stock \\u00e9tait d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 \\u00e9coul\\u00e9. Les commandes de figurines de Buzz ont atteint les 1,6\\u00a0million apr\\u00e8s une semaine de diffusion. En 2007, on comptait 25\\u00a0millions de figurines vendues, tous personnages confondus.\\n Toy Story a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 au centre d'une grande campagne de marketing avant sa sortie qui mettait en avant des images du film, par exemple sur les emballages alimentaires. Une grande diversit\\u00e9 de produits d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9s est sortie durant l'exploitation en salles du film et durant sa sortie en VHS dont des jouets, des v\\u00eatements ou des chaussures.\\n Disney a d\\u00e9pens\\u00e9 20\\u00a0millions de dollars pour le marketing autour du film\\u00a0; Burger King, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola et Payless ShoeSource ont eux d\\u00e9pens\\u00e9 125\\u00a0millions de dollars dans des op\\u00e9rations mettant en jeu la promotion autour du film,. The New York Times d\\u00e9taille quelques-unes des d\\u00e9penses\\u00a0: 45\\u00a0millions de dollars pour Burger King, 75\\u00a0\\u00e0 80\\u00a0millions de sachets promotionnels chez Frito-Lay, filiale de PepsiCo, tandis que Coca-Cola a propos\\u00e9 des promotions sur la gamme Minute Maid (alors en perte de vitesse).\\n Un consultant marketing a dit \\u00e0 propos de cette promotion\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Comment un enfant, assis devant un film d'une heure et demie mettant en sc\\u00e8ne une foule de jouets reconnaissables \\u00e0 l'\\u0153il, pourra ne pas vouloir en poss\\u00e9der un\\u00a0?\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n \\n AllMusic\\u00a0: \\n modifier  Classements\\u00a0:\\n La premi\\u00e8re de Toy Story a eu lieu le 19 novembre 1995 \\u00e0 Hollywood, en Californie dans le El Capitan Theatre.

Le tout premier court-m\\u00e9trage de Pixar, Les Aventures d'Andr\\u00e9 et Wally B., \\u00e9tait projet\\u00e9 avant chaque diffusion du film dans tous les cin\\u00e9mas.\\n \\u00a0Sauf indication contraire ou compl\\u00e9mentaire, les informations mentionn\\u00e9es dans cette section peuvent \\u00eatre confirm\\u00e9es par la base de donn\\u00e9es IMDb.\\n Dans la plupart de ces pays, le film est ressorti dans une version en relief (projection en relief st\\u00e9r\\u00e9oscopique) et a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9 avec Toy Story 2, avant la sortie du troisi\\u00e8me volet.\\n \\u00c0 sa sortie, Toy Story \\u00e9tait la seule production de Pixar qui arborait uniquement le logo de Disney, malgr\\u00e9 la collaboration des deux entreprises sur le film. Cependant, depuis l'acquisition compl\\u00e8te de Pixar par The Walt Disney Company en 2006, Toy Story \\u2014 tout comme les autres films produits par Pixar \\u2014 fait d\\u00e9sormais figurer la marque Disney\\u2022Pixar.\\n Toy Story a re\\u00e7u un accueil critique tr\\u00e8s favorable par les critiques du monde entier.

Sa premi\\u00e8re sortie en DVD remonte au 17 octobre 2000, o\\u00f9 il \\u00e9tait inclus dans un pack avec Toy Story 2 (avant d'\\u00eatre plus tard disponible individuellement). \\u00c9galement le 17 octobre 2000, un ensemble de trois DVD est sorti, l\\u2019Ultimate Toy Box, compos\\u00e9 de Toy Story, Toy Story 2 et un DVD de bonus. Le 6 septembre 2005, un double-DVD en l'honneur du dixi\\u00e8me anniversaire de la s\\u00e9rie est sorti, contenant une grande partie des bonus de l\\u2019Ultimate Toy Box.\\n Toy Story a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 disponible en format Blu-ray pour la premi\\u00e8re fois dans le Special Edition Combo Pack qui contenait deux disques\\u00a0: le film en format Blu-ray et le film en format DVD, et qui est sorti le 23 novembre 2010.\\n R\\u00e9compenses\\n Nominations\\n Ce premier long-m\\u00e9trage des studios Pixar marque un tournant dans l'histoire du dessin anim\\u00e9\\u00a0: c'est le premier film enti\\u00e8rement r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 en images de synth\\u00e8se 3D\\u00a0; coproduit par les studios Disney, il inaugure une suite de succ\\u00e8s parmi lesquels 1001 pattes (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monstres et Cie (2001), Le Monde de Nemo (2003), Les Indestructibles (2004), Cars (2006), Ratatouille (2007), WALL-E (2008), L\\u00e0-haut (2009) et Toy Story 3 (2010).\\n Amor\\u00e7ant une tradition chez les studios Pixar, Toy Story renferme de multiples clins d'\\u0153il \\u00e0 l'industrie du cin\\u00e9ma. Par exemple, la th\\u00e9i\\u00e8re qu'utilise Hannah quand elle joue avec Buzz est une r\\u00e9plique de la th\\u00e9i\\u00e8re de l'Utah, mod\\u00e8le utilis\\u00e9 dans la synth\\u00e8se d'image 3D qui est devenu un objet standard de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence dans la communaut\\u00e9 de la synth\\u00e8se d'image. De nombreux clins d'\\u0153il sont plus particuli\\u00e8rement port\\u00e9s sur l'entreprise Disney. Lorsque Buzz veut prouver \\u00e0 Woody qu'il sait voler, une image de Mickey Mouse est cach\\u00e9e sur une r\\u00e9plique g\\u00e9ante de montre. Enfin, vers la fin du film, quand Woody et Buzz arrivent pr\\u00e8s de la voiture d'Andy en roulant et qu'on les voit dans le r\\u00e9troviseur, on peut entendre la chanson Hakuna matata du film d'animation Le Roi lion, sorti un an auparavant.\\n Le film est aussi parsem\\u00e9 de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences \\u00e0 l'histoire de Pixar et \\u00e0 ses courts m\\u00e9trages pass\\u00e9s. Quand le livreur de Pizza Planet entre dans la station-service Dinoco, il demande o\\u00f9 se situe le West Cutting Boulevard. C'\\u00e9tait en fait l'adresse des studios d'animation Pixar \\u00e0 Richmond (Californie), \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9poque de la r\\u00e9alisation du film. Depuis 2000, les studios ont d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nag\\u00e9 \\u00e0 Emeryville (Californie). La lampe de bureau et le ballon jaune avec une \\u00e9toile rouge font r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence au premier court-m\\u00e9trage de Pixar, Luxo Jr. (1986),. Dans la sc\\u00e8ne o\\u00f9 Woody invite les jouets \\u00e0 se trouver un partenaire de d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement, on peut apercevoir en arri\\u00e8re-plan sur une \\u00e9tag\\u00e8re un livre intitul\\u00e9 Tin Toy dont l'auteur mentionn\\u00e9 est Lasseter (une r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 John Lasseter). C'est de ce court-m\\u00e9trage r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 en 1988 par Lasseter que Toy Story est inspir\\u00e9. On trouve aussi un livre nomm\\u00e9 Knick Knack, autre court m\\u00e9trage de Pixar, datant lui de 1989.\\n Toy Story marque \\u00e9galement le d\\u00e9but d'une longue liste d'apparitions d'objets r\\u00e9currents dans les films sign\\u00e9s Pixar. Le code A113, qui \\u00e9tait \\u00e0 l'origine le num\\u00e9ro d'une classe de CalArts (\\u00e9cole o\\u00f9 ont travaill\\u00e9 John Lasseter et Brad Bird) et qui appara\\u00eetra dans tous les autres longs m\\u00e9trages de Pixar, appara\\u00eet dans le film, sur la plaque d'immatriculation du monospace de la m\\u00e8re d'Andy. Figure \\u00e9galement dans le film la compagnie Dinoco, qui sera aussi pr\\u00e9sente dans Cars et WALL-E, ainsi que la cha\\u00eene de pizzerias Pizza Planet, dont le camion appara\\u00eetra dans la quasi-int\\u00e9gralit\\u00e9 des longs m\\u00e9trages de Pixar. Quand Luxo Junior bouscule Buzz par la fen\\u00eatre ouverte, celui-ci pousse le c\\u00e9l\\u00e8bre cri Wilhelm qui pourra \\u00eatre entendu \\u00e9galement dans Toy Story 3.\\n Le sol o\\u00f9 se trouvent Woody et Buzz quand ils tentent de s'\\u00e9chapper de la maison de Sid fait r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 celui de l'h\\u00f4tel Overlook dans Shining.\\n Diff\\u00e9rents auteurs ont vu de l'humanisme dans le film et l'ont rapproch\\u00e9 du roman Don Quichotte,. Bruce R. Burningham a \\u00e9tabli des comparaisons entre les personnages des deux \\u0153uvres. Ainsi, Buzz l'\\u00c9clair se rapprocherait de Don Quichotte alors que Woody est compar\\u00e9 \\u00e0 Sancho Panza. Burningham avance que ce dernier, au cours du film, \\u00e9prouve des difficult\\u00e9s dues \\u00e0 ses rapports avec Buzz, un nouveau venu plein d'illusions. Rossinante, le cheval de Don Quichotte, serait devenu le vaisseau spatial accident\\u00e9 de Buzz. Il souligne toutefois que Dulcin\\u00e9e n'a pas d'\\u00e9quivalent dans le film de Pixar. Pour lui, cela vient du fait que dans la tradition chevaleresque, chaque chevalier a une femme \\u00e0 qui il peut se confier, tandis que les codes de la science-fiction ne pr\\u00e9voient pas de personnage qui aurait un tel r\\u00f4le vis-\\u00e0-vis des rangers de l'espace.\\n Burningham met \\u00e9galement en \\u00e9vidence un lien entre les histoires de Toy Story et de Don Quichotte\\u00a0: comme Don Quichotte, dont la g\\u00e9n\\u00e9alogie est d\\u00e9lib\\u00e9r\\u00e9ment ambigu\\u00eb, Buzz n'a pas de v\\u00e9ritable histoire avant le d\\u00e9but du film. Il se r\\u00e9veille ex nihilo de son \\u00ab\\u00a0hypersomnolence\\u00a0\\u00bb, aussi vite qu'Alonso Quichano se d\\u00e9couvre une nouvelle identit\\u00e9 dans le premier chapitre. Plus loin dans le film, Buzz essaie de trouver un \\u00ab\\u00a0vaisseau\\u00a0\\u00bb pour revenir sur sa \\u00ab\\u00a0plan\\u00e8te\\u00a0\\u00bb pendant que Woody tente de trouver un moyen de revenir avec Buzz dans la chambre d'Andy, et ce en se servant des illusions de Buzz. Pour Burningham, cette situation est calqu\\u00e9e sur le sch\\u00e9ma narratif du roman de Cervantes, o\\u00f9 Sancho, tout comme Woody, apprend vite \\u00e0 se servir des r\\u00eaves de son ma\\u00eetre pour arriver \\u00e0 ses propres fins.\\n Toy Story a eu un impact important sur l'industrie cin\\u00e9matographique de par le c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 innovant de l'animation en images de synth\\u00e8se. Apr\\u00e8s la sortie du film, diverses industries se sont int\\u00e9ress\\u00e9es \\u00e0 la technologie utilis\\u00e9e dans le film. Les fabricants de cartes graphiques ont souhait\\u00e9 pouvoir cr\\u00e9er des images similaires \\u00e0 celles du film pour les ordinateurs personnels, les d\\u00e9veloppeurs de jeu vid\\u00e9o ont voulu apprendre \\u00e0 reproduire ce type d'animation dans leurs jeux et les chercheurs en robotique se sont pench\\u00e9s sur la mise en place d'une intelligence artificielle dans leurs robots pour que ceux-ci aient un comportement proche de celui des personnages du film.\\n \\nD'apr\\u00e8s Jason Bosse, \\u00ab\\u00a0tous ceux qui travaillent dans l'animation traditionnelle ont compris qu'il fallait se surpasser, faire jouer les personnages de fa\\u00e7on plus vraie, et non pas se contenter du style traditionnel qui \\u00e9tait appliqu\\u00e9 depuis 20\\u00a0ans\\u00a0\\u00bb .  \\u00ab\\u00a0Nous n'aurions pas pu faire ce film par la voie de l'animation traditionnelle. C'est une histoire qui ne peut \\u00eatre racont\\u00e9e qu'avec des personnages en trois dimensions\\u2026 Certains des plans du film sont si beaux.\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0Tom Schumacher, vice-pr\\u00e9sident de Walt Disney Feature Animation Le personnage de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair et sa phrase phare, \\u00ab\\u00a0Vers l'infini et au-del\\u00e0\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb (au Qu\\u00e9bec, \\u00ab\\u00a0Vers l'infini et plus loin encore\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb), ont particip\\u00e9 \\u00e0 la renomm\\u00e9e du film. Le personnage est si populaire qu'en 2008, des astronautes ont emmen\\u00e9 une figurine de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair dans l'espace \\u00e0 bord de la navette spatiale Discovery pour le tournage d'un film p\\u00e9dagogique.\\n La phrase \\u00ab\\u00a0Vers l'infini et au-del\\u00e0\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb est apparue sur plusieurs tee-shirts tir\\u00e9s du film. De par sa grande popularit\\u00e9, elle a m\\u00eame \\u00e9t\\u00e9 utilis\\u00e9e par quelques philosophes et math\\u00e9maticiens dans leurs publications,,. En 2008, cette phrase a de nouveau fait le tour des nouvelles mondiales lorsqu'on a appris qu'un p\\u00e8re et son fils, tout au long des 15\\u00a0heures pendant lesquelles ils ont nag\\u00e9 dans l'oc\\u00e9an Atlantique, avaient continuellement r\\u00e9p\\u00e9t\\u00e9 cette phrase afin de ne pas se perdre mutuellement,.\\n Buzz ainsi que les autres personnages du film font d\\u00e9sormais partie de la culture populaire\\u00a0: Debian, un syst\\u00e8me d'exploitation libre pour ordinateur, \\u00e0 la suite de la d\\u00e9cision de Bruce Perens le chef de projet de l'\\u00e9poque qui travaillait aussi pour Pixar, a baptis\\u00e9 ses versions successives des noms des personnages du film\\u00a0; \\u00e0 savoir Buzz, Rex, Bo, Hamm, Slink, Potato, Woody, Sarge, Etch, Lenny, Squeeze, Wheezy, Jessie, Etch, Sid et Buster. Le logo en forme de spirale de Debian serait inspir\\u00e9, selon Martin Krafft par la forme particuli\\u00e8re du menton de Buzz.\\n La bande originale de Toy Story a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 produite par Walt Disney Records et est sortie le 22 novembre 1995, la semaine de la sortie du film. Compos\\u00e9e et \\u00e9crite par Randy Newman, la bande originale a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 lou\\u00e9e pour sa musique \\u00ab\\u00a0vive et remuante\\u00a0\\u00bb.

Cependant, comme l'histoire \\u00e9tait consid\\u00e9r\\u00e9e assez bonne pour ne pas sortir directement en vid\\u00e9o, il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 annonc\\u00e9 en 1998 que la suite sortirait en salles. L'enregistrement des voix de Toy Story 2, dans lequel Woody est vol\\u00e9 durant un vide-greniers, a vu le retour de la majorit\\u00e9 des voix pr\\u00e9sentes dans le premier volet.

Ce travail a dur\\u00e9 quatre mois, et il a fallu six mois suppl\\u00e9mentaires pour ajouter la 3D aux deux films. Le principal st\\u00e9r\\u00e9ographe Bob Whitehill a supervis\\u00e9 ce travail en cherchant \\u00e0 obtenir un rendu qui ait une influence \\u00e9motionnelle sur la narration du film\\u00a0:\\n \\u00ab\\u00a0Pour chercher les meilleures fa\\u00e7ons d'utiliser la 3D au profit de l'histoire d'un film, je regarde le film dans son ensemble. Par exemple, dans Toy Story, lorsque les jouets sont seuls dans leur monde, je voulais rendre l'impression d'un monde o\\u00f9 l'on vit en s\\u00e9curit\\u00e9. Et lorsqu'ils sortent dans le monde des hommes, c'est l\\u00e0 que je fais r\\u00e9ellement intervenir la 3D pour bien refl\\u00e9ter le fait que ce monde est dangereux, compliqu\\u00e9 et bouleversant.\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0Bob Whitehill La reprise en 3D du film a obtenu de bons r\\u00e9sultats au box-office am\\u00e9ricain, recueillant 12\\u00a0491\\u00a0789\\u00a0$ lors du premier week-end d'exploitation, le pla\\u00e7ant alors troisi\\u00e8me derri\\u00e8re Bienvenue \\u00e0 Zombieland et Temp\\u00eate de boulettes g\\u00e9antes.\\n En novembre 1996, le spectacle sur glace Disney on Ice\\u00a0: Toy Story a ouvert ses portes.

Pour les autres significations, voir Alice au pays des merveilles (homonymie).\\n \\n Les Aventures d'Alice au pays des merveilles (titre original\\u00a0: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland), fr\\u00e9quemment abr\\u00e9g\\u00e9 en Alice au pays des merveilles, est un roman publi\\u00e9 en 1865 par Lewis Carroll. Il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 traduit en fran\\u00e7ais pour la premi\\u00e8re fois en 1869 par la m\\u00eame maison d'\\u00e9dition (Macmillan and Co).\\n Lors de sa premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9criture, le livre n'\\u00e9tait pas destin\\u00e9 aux enfants. L'\\u00e9criture fut reprise une seconde fois pour les enfants en conservant les personnages merveilleux qui la rendaient si attrayante pour ce jeune public. Le roman foisonne d'allusions satiriques aux amis de l'\\u00e9crivain et aux le\\u00e7ons que les \\u00e9coliers britanniques devaient m\\u00e9moriser \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9poque. Le pays des merveilles d\\u00e9crit dans le conte joue sans cesse avec la logique. L'ouvrage reste populaire au XXIe\\u00a0si\\u00e8cle, aussi bien aupr\\u00e8s des enfants que des adultes.\\n Le livre a connu une suite intitul\\u00e9e De l'autre c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 du miroir. Les adaptations cin\\u00e9matographiques combinent souvent des \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments des deux livres. L'\\u00e9crivain am\\u00e9ricain Martin Gardner a publi\\u00e9 The Annotated Alice, qui regroupe Alice au pays des merveilles et De l'autre c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 du miroir accompagn\\u00e9s des po\\u00e8mes victoriens que Lewis Carroll parodia dans le corps du texte.\\n Le livre a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 publi\\u00e9 le 4 juillet 1865, trois ans jour pour jour apr\\u00e8s une promenade en barque sur l'Isis (qui coule \\u00e0 Oxford) effectu\\u00e9e par les r\\u00e9v\\u00e9rends Dodgson (Carroll) et Robinson Duckworth en compagnie de trois jeunes filles\\u00a0:\\n L'excursion commen\\u00e7a au pont Folly pr\\u00e8s d'Oxford et finit une dizaine de kilom\\u00e8tres plus loin dans le village de Godstow. Durant le trajet, Dodgson raconta aux s\\u0153urs Liddell une histoire qu'il venait d'inventer. Celle-ci fut suivie plus tard par Alice's Adventures Underground et finit par devenir Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\\n En 1998, un exemplaire de la premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9dition a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 vendu 1,5 million de dollars, ce qui est une vente record pour un livre pour enfants. Seuls vingt-deux exemplaires de la premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9dition de 1865 auraient surv\\u00e9cu. Dix-sept d'entre eux se trouvent dans des biblioth\\u00e8ques et cinq chez des particuliers.\\n Alice s'ennuie aupr\\u00e8s de sa s\\u0153ur qui lit un livre (\\u00ab\\u00a0sans images, ni dialogues\\u00a0\\u00bb) tandis qu'elle ne fait rien. \\u00ab\\u00a0\\u00c0 quoi bon un livre sans images, ni dialogues\\u00a0?\\u00a0\\u00bb, se demande Alice. Mais voil\\u00e0 qu'un lapin blanc aux yeux roses v\\u00eatu d'une redingote avec une montre \\u00e0 gousset \\u00e0 y ranger passe pr\\u00e8s d'elle en courant. Cela ne l'\\u00e9tonne pas le moins du monde. Pourtant, lorsqu'elle le voit sortir une montre de sa poche et s'\\u00e9crier\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Je suis en retard\\u00a0! En retard\\u00a0! En retard\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb, elle se dit que d\\u00e9cid\\u00e9ment ce lapin a quelque chose de particulier. En entrant derri\\u00e8re lui dans son terrier, elle fait une chute presque interminable qui l'emm\\u00e8ne dans un monde aux antipodes du sien. Elle va rencontrer une galerie de personnages retors et se trouver confront\\u00e9e au paradoxe, \\u00e0 l'absurde et au bizarre\\u2026\\n Alice suit un lapin dans son terrier. Puis elle trouve une cl\\u00e9 qui m\\u00e8ne \\u00e0 un joli jardin. Elle boit une boisson \\u00e9tiquet\\u00e9e \\\"bois-moi\\\" et mange un g\\u00e2teau \\u00e9tiquet\\u00e9 \\\"mange-moi\\\" qui la fait r\\u00e9tr\\u00e9cir afin qu'elle puisse entrer dans le jardin.\\n Alice rencontre une souris fran\\u00e7aise et elle essaie de converser en fran\\u00e7ais \\u00e9l\\u00e9mentaire. Elle offense alors la souris qui tente de lui \\u00e9chapper.\\n Alice participe \\u00e0 une course avec les animaux du groupe mais elle les fait fuir en parlant de son f\\u00e9roce chat[N 1].\\n Le lapin blanc r\\u00e9appara\\u00eet alors qu'il cherche les gants et l'\\u00e9ventail de la duchesse et demande \\u00e0 Alice de l'aider. Alice boit dans une petite bouteille et commence \\u00e0 devenir g\\u00e9ante, mais trouve ensuite des petits g\\u00e2teaux pour l'aider \\u00e0 se r\\u00e9duire \\u00e0 sa taille normale.\\n Alice trouve un champignon et une chenille qui fume un narguil\\u00e9. Elle parvient \\u00e0 manger les bonnes quantit\\u00e9s de champignon pour qu'elle puisse retrouver sa taille normale parce qu'elle pense qu'elle a perdu son identit\\u00e9,.\\n La duchesse donne \\u00e0 Alice un b\\u00e9b\\u00e9 qui se transforme en cochon, puis la petite fille rencontre le chat du Cheshire.\\n Alice assiste \\u00e0 un go\\u00fbter avec le Li\\u00e8vre de mars, le Chapelier fou et un Loir tr\\u00e8s fatigu\\u00e9. Ils donnent \\u00e0 Alice de nombreuses \\u00e9nigmes \\u00e0 r\\u00e9soudre, alors Alice dit que c'est le go\\u00fbter le plus stupide auquel elle ait jamais assist\\u00e9.\\n Alice quitte la f\\u00eate et trouve trois cartes peignant les roses blanches, parce que la Reine de c\\u0153ur d\\u00e9teste les roses blanches. Alice rencontre alors le roi et la reine et est invit\\u00e9e \\u00e0 jouer au croquet avec eux.\\n Alice est pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9e au Griffon qui l'emm\\u00e8ne chez la fausse tortue, qui est tr\\u00e8s triste.\\n Alice r\\u00e9cite le quadrille du homard et la danse des fausses tortues et des griffons.\\n Le valet de c\\u0153ur est accus\\u00e9 d'avoir vol\\u00e9 les tartes de la reine.\\n Alice est appel\\u00e9e comme t\\u00e9moin, mais elle est accus\\u00e9e du crime. La reine ordonne \\u00ab\\u00a0de lui couper la t\\u00eate\\u00a0\\u00bb, mais avant qu'Alice ne soit tu\\u00e9e, sa s\\u0153ur la r\\u00e9veille du r\\u00eave.\\n Dans 'The Annotated Alice\\u00a0(en)', Martin Gardner fournit des informations g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rales sur les personnages. Gardner a sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 que le Chapelier est une r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 Theophilus Carter\\u00a0(en), un marchand de meubles connu \\u00e0 Oxford, et que Tenniel a apparemment dessin\\u00e9 le Chapelier pour qu'il ressemble \\u00e0 Carter, sur une suggestion de Carroll.\\n La fausse tortue est une r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence au critique d'art John Ruskin, qui venait une fois par semaine \\u00e0 la maison Liddell pour enseigner aux enfants le dessin, le croquis et la peinture \\u00e0 l'huile.\\n Lewis Carroll r\\u00e9alisa lui-m\\u00eame 37 dessins \\u00e0 la plume dans l'exemplaire manuscrit de l'histoire qu'il offrit \\u00e0 Alice Liddell, le 26 novembre 1864. Une \\u00e9dition en fac simil\\u00e9 (avec une traduction fran\\u00e7aise) a d'ailleurs \\u00e9t\\u00e9 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9e par les \\u00e9ditions Fr\\u00e9mok en 2006.\\n Les sources divergent sur la question de savoir si c'est Dodgson ou son \\u00e9diteur qui jugea bon de ne pas garder ses propres images. C'est en tout cas Lewis Carroll qui opta pour John Tenniel, dessinateur alors r\\u00e9put\\u00e9 pour sa participation \\u00e0 la revue satirique Punch.\\n Bien que les illustrations de John Tenniel restent tr\\u00e8s associ\\u00e9es \\u00e0 l'\\u0153uvre, le texte de Carroll a inspir\\u00e9 un grand nombre d'illustrateurs au fil du temps. Plusieurs centaines de versions ont ainsi vu le jour. Parmi les plus notables\\u00a0:\\n Carroll a \\u00e9crit beaucoup de chansons et po\\u00e8mes pour 'Les Aventures d'Alice au pays des merveilles' notamment\\u00a0:\\n Martin Gardner et d'autres sp\\u00e9cialistes ont montr\\u00e9 que le livre est rempli de nombreuses parodies de la culture populaire victorienne, sugg\\u00e9rant qu'il appartient dans l'esprit \\u00e0 Topsyturveydom de W. S. Gilbert et Alfred Cellier.\\n La plupart des aventures du livre peuvent avoir \\u00e9t\\u00e9 bas\\u00e9es sur ou influenc\\u00e9es par des personnes, des situations et des b\\u00e2timents \\u00e0 Oxford et \\u00e0 Christ Church. Par exemple, le \\\"Rabbit Hole\\\" symbolisait les v\\u00e9ritables escaliers situ\\u00e9s \\u00e0 l'arri\\u00e8re de la salle principale de Christ Church. Une sculpture repr\\u00e9sentant un griffon et un lapin, telle qu'on peut la voir dans la cath\\u00e9drale de Ripon, o\\u00f9 le p\\u00e8re de Carroll \\u00e9tait chanoine, a peut-\\u00eatre inspir\\u00e9 le conte.\\n Dans le huiti\\u00e8me chapitre, trois cartes peignent en rouge les roses d'un rosier, parce qu'elles avaient accidentellement plant\\u00e9 un rosier blanc que la reine de c\\u0153ur d\\u00e9teste. Les roses rouges symbolisaient la maison anglaise des Lancaster, tandis que les roses blanches symbolisaient leur maison rivale des York, et les guerres qui les opposaient \\u00e9taient donc les guerres des Roses.\\n Si le livre est rest\\u00e9 imprim\\u00e9 et inspire continuellement de nouvelles adaptations, le mat\\u00e9riel culturel dont il s'inspire est devenu un savoir largement sp\\u00e9cialis\\u00e9. Le Dr Leon Coward affirme que le livre \\\"souffre\\\" de \\\"lectures qui refl\\u00e8tent la fascination d'aujourd'hui pour le postmodernisme et la psychologie, plut\\u00f4t que de se plonger dans une interpr\\u00e9tation historiquement inform\\u00e9e\\\", et suppose que cela est d\\u00fb en partie au fait que le public d\\u00e9couvre le r\\u00e9cit \\u00e0 travers une source \\\"de seconde main\\\", expliquant que \\\"nos impressions du texte original sont bas\\u00e9es sur une multiplicit\\u00e9 de r\\u00e9interpr\\u00e9tations. Nous ne r\\u00e9alisons pas n\\u00e9cessairement que nous manquons quelque chose dans la compr\\u00e9hension du produit original, parce que nous n'avons g\\u00e9n\\u00e9ralement jamais affaire au produit original\\\".\\n Plusieurs personnes, dont Martin Gardner et Selwyn Goodacre, ont sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 que Dodgson s'int\\u00e9ressait \\u00e0 la langue fran\\u00e7aise, choisissant d'y faire des r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences et des jeux de mots dans l'histoire. Il est plus que probable qu'il s'agisse de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences aux le\\u00e7ons de fran\\u00e7ais - une caract\\u00e9ristique commune de l'\\u00e9ducation d'une fille de la classe moyenne victorienne. Par exemple, dans le deuxi\\u00e8me chapitre, Alice suppose que la souris est peut-\\u00eatre fran\\u00e7aise. Elle choisit donc de lui dire la premi\\u00e8re phrase de son livre de cours de fran\\u00e7ais\\u00a0: \\\"O\\u00f9 est ma chatte\\u00a0?\\\" (\\\"Where is my cat?\\\"). Dans la traduction fran\\u00e7aise d'Henri Bu\\u00e9, Alice suppose que la souris est peut-\\u00eatre italienne et lui parle en italien.\\n L'expression \\\" Digging for apples \\\" de Pat pourrait \\u00eatre un jeu de mots interlinguistique, puisque pomme de terre signifie pomme de terre et pomme signifie pomme.\\n Dans le deuxi\\u00e8me chapitre, Alice s'adresse d'abord \\u00e0 la souris en disant \\\" O Souris \\\", en se basant sur son souvenir des d\\u00e9clinaisons du nom \\\" dans la grammaire latine de son fr\\u00e8re, 'Une souris - d'une souris - \\u00e0 une souris - une souris - O souris\\u00a0!' \\\". Ces mots correspondent aux cinq premiers des six cas du latin, dans un ordre traditionnel \\u00e9tabli par les grammairiens m\\u00e9di\\u00e9vaux\\u00a0: mus (nominatif), muris (g\\u00e9nitif), muri (datif), murem (accusatif), (O) mus (vocatif). Le sixi\\u00e8me cas, mure (ablatif) est absent de la r\\u00e9citation d'Alice. Nilson a plausiblement sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 que l'absence de l'ablatif d'Alice est un jeu de mots sur le travail de son p\\u00e8re Henry Liddell sur le standard A Greek-English Lexicon puisque le grec ancien n'a pas de cas ablatif. De plus, Mousa (signifiant muse) \\u00e9tait un nom mod\\u00e8le standard dans les livres grecs de l'\\u00e9poque dans les paradigmes de la premi\\u00e8re d\\u00e9clinaison, nom court-alpha. En outre, la phrase \\\"O Muse, sing...\\\" ou une variante proche de celle-ci figure dans de nombreuses traductions anglaises d'Hom\\u00e8re, la prononciation par Alice de \\\"O Mouse\\\" formant un jeu de mots qui aurait \\u00e9t\\u00e9 apparent pour les plus instruits parmi le lectorat victorien de Dodgson, \\u00e9tant donn\\u00e9 la relative importance des lettres classiques dans les programmes d'enseignement des classes sup\\u00e9rieures britanniques \\u00e0 cette \\u00e9poque.\\n Comme Carroll \\u00e9tait math\\u00e9maticien \\u00e0 Christ Church, il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 qu'il y a beaucoup de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences et de concepts math\\u00e9matiques dans cette histoire et dans Through the Looking-Glass. La sp\\u00e9cialiste de la litt\\u00e9rature Melanie Bayley a affirm\\u00e9 dans le magazine New Scientist que Dodgson a \\u00e9crit Alice au pays des merveilles dans sa forme finale comme une satire cinglante des nouvelles math\\u00e9matiques modernes qui \\u00e9mergeaient au milieu du XIXe si\\u00e8cle,.\\n Voici quelques exemples de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences aux math\\u00e9matiques dans Alice\\u00a0:\\n Chapitre 1 (\\\" Down the Rabbit-Hole \\\")\\u00a0: alors qu'elle r\\u00e9tr\\u00e9cit, Alice s'interroge avec philosophie sur la taille finale qu'elle atteindra, peut-\\u00eatre \\\" en s'\\u00e9teignant compl\\u00e8tement, comme une bougie \\\"\\u00a0; cette r\\u00e9flexion refl\\u00e8te le concept de limite.\\n Chapitre 2 (\\\"La piscine de larmes\\\")\\u00a0: Alice essaie d'effectuer une multiplication mais obtient des r\\u00e9sultats \\u00e9tranges\\u00a0: \\\"Voyons voir\\u00a0: quatre fois cinq font douze, quatre fois six font treize, et quatre fois sept font... Oh l\\u00e0 l\\u00e0\\u00a0! Je n'arriverai jamais \\u00e0 vingt \\u00e0 ce rythme\\u00a0!\\\" On explore ainsi la repr\\u00e9sentation des nombres \\u00e0 l'aide de diff\\u00e9rentes bases et syst\\u00e8mes num\\u00e9raux positionnels\\u00a0: 4 \\u00d7 5 = 12 en notation de base 18, 4 \\u00d7 6 = 13 en notation de base 21 et 4 \\u00d7 7 = 14 en notation de base 24. En continuant cette s\\u00e9quence, en augmentant de trois bases \\u00e0 chaque fois, le r\\u00e9sultat sera toujours inf\\u00e9rieur \\u00e0 20 dans la notation de la base correspondante. (Apr\\u00e8s 4 \\u00d7 12 = 19 en base 39, le produit serait 4 \\u00d7 13 = 1A en base 42, puis 1B, 1C, 1D, et ainsi de suite).\\n Chapitre 7 (\\\"Un Tea-Party fou\\\")\\u00a0: Le Li\\u00e8vre de mars, le Chapelier et le Loir donnent plusieurs exemples dans lesquels la valeur s\\u00e9mantique d'une phrase A n'est pas la m\\u00eame que celle du contraire de A (par exemple, \\\"On pourrait tout aussi bien dire que \\\"Je vois ce que je mange\\\" est la m\\u00eame chose que \\\"Je mange ce que je vois\\\"\\u00a0!\\\")\\u00a0; en logique et en math\\u00e9matiques, on parle de relation inverse. Alice se demande \\u00e9galement ce que signifie le fait que le changement de si\\u00e8ge autour de la table circulaire les ram\\u00e8ne au d\\u00e9but. Il s'agit d'une observation de l'addition sur l'anneau des nombres entiers modulo N.\\n Le chat du Cheshire s'estompe jusqu'\\u00e0 dispara\\u00eetre compl\\u00e8tement, ne laissant que son large sourire suspendu dans l'air, ce qui am\\u00e8ne Alice \\u00e0 s'\\u00e9merveiller et \\u00e0 noter qu'elle a vu un chat sans sourire, mais jamais un sourire sans chat. L'abstraction profonde des concepts, comme la g\\u00e9om\\u00e9trie non euclidienne, l'alg\\u00e8bre abstraite et les d\\u00e9buts de la logique math\\u00e9matique, s'emparait des math\\u00e9matiques \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9poque o\\u00f9 Dodgson \\u00e9crivait. La d\\u00e9limitation par Dodgson de la relation entre le chat et le grin peut \\u00eatre consid\\u00e9r\\u00e9e comme repr\\u00e9sentant le concept m\\u00eame des math\\u00e9matiques et du nombre. Par exemple, au lieu de consid\\u00e9rer deux ou trois pommes, on peut facilement consid\\u00e9rer le concept de \\\"pomme\\\", dont les concepts de \\\"deux\\\" et \\\"trois\\\" semblent d\\u00e9pendre. Un saut beaucoup plus sophistiqu\\u00e9 consiste \\u00e0 consid\\u00e9rer les concepts de \\\"deux\\\" et \\\"trois\\\" par eux-m\\u00eames, tout comme un sourire, qui semblait \\u00e0 l'origine d\\u00e9pendre du chat, s\\u00e9par\\u00e9 conceptuellement de son objet physique.\\n Carina Garland note comment le monde est \\\"exprim\\u00e9 par des repr\\u00e9sentations de la nourriture et de l'app\\u00e9tit\\\", citant le d\\u00e9sir fr\\u00e9quent d'Alice de consommer (\\u00e0 la fois de la nourriture et des mots), ses \\\"app\\u00e9tits curieux\\\". Souvent, l'id\\u00e9e de manger co\\u00efncide avec des images macabres. Apr\\u00e8s l'\\u00e9nigme \\\"Pourquoi un corbeau ressemble-t-il \\u00e0 un pupitre\\u00a0?\\\", le Chapelier affirme qu'Alice pourrait tout aussi bien dire \\\"Je vois ce que je mange... je mange ce que je vois\\\" et la solution de l'\\u00e9nigme, propos\\u00e9e par Boe Birns, pourrait donc \\u00eatre la suivante\\u00a0: \\\"Un corbeau mange des vers\\u00a0; un pupitre est mang\\u00e9 par des vers\\\"\\u00a0; cette id\\u00e9e de nourriture r\\u00e9sume l'id\\u00e9e de la vie qui se nourrit de la vie elle-m\\u00eame, car le ver est mang\\u00e9 et devient ensuite le mangeur - une image horrible de la mortalit\\u00e9.\\n Nina Auerbach explique que le roman tourne autour du boire et du manger, ce qui \\\"motive une grande partie de son comportement [celui d'Alice]\\\", car l'histoire porte essentiellement sur les choses qui \\\"entrent et sortent de sa bouche\\\". Les animaux du pays des merveilles sont particuli\\u00e8rement int\\u00e9ressants, car la relation d'Alice avec eux change constamment. En effet, comme le dit Lovell-Smith, les changements de taille d'Alice la repositionnent continuellement dans la cha\\u00eene alimentaire, ce qui lui fait prendre conscience de l'attitude \\\"manger ou \\u00eatre mang\\u00e9\\\" qui r\\u00e8gne au pays des merveilles.\\n Article principal\\u00a0: \\u0152uvres bas\\u00e9es sur Alice au pays des merveilles\\n En 2015, Robert Douglas-Fairhurst a \\u00e9crit dans The Guardian,\\n Depuis la premi\\u00e8re publication des Aventures d'Alice au pays des merveilles il y a 150 ans, l'\\u0153uvre de Lewis Carroll a donn\\u00e9 naissance \\u00e0 toute une industrie, des films aux man\\u00e8ges de parcs \\u00e0 th\\u00e8me en passant par des produits tels qu'un costume d'Alice \\\"mignonne et insolente\\\" (\\\"jupon et bas non inclus\\\"). La petite fille au visage vide rendue c\\u00e9l\\u00e8bre par les illustrations originales de John Tenniel est devenue une tache d'encre culturelle que nous pouvons interpr\\u00e9ter comme bon nous semble.\\n Alice et le reste du Pays des Merveilles continuent d'inspirer ou d'influencer de nombreuses autres \\u0153uvres d'art jusqu'\\u00e0 aujourd'hui, parfois indirectement via le film Disney de 1951, par exemple. On trouve des r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences, des hommages, des remaniements et des \\u0153uvres d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9es dans de nombreuses \\u0153uvres de litt\\u00e9rature, de cin\\u00e9ma, de th\\u00e9\\u00e2tre, d'art visuel, de musique et de jeux (comme les cartes \\u00e0 jouer).

Comment ajouter mes sources\\u00a0?\\n \\n Les Quatre Filles du docteur March (titre original\\u00a0: Little Women)  est un roman de l\\u2019autrice am\\u00e9ricaine Louisa May Alcott, publi\\u00e9 dans un premier temps en deux volumes. Le premier parut en 1868 et le second en 1869. \\u00c0 sa sortie, le premier volume connut un franc succ\\u00e8s, autant dans la presse qu'aupr\\u00e8s du public, tant et si bien que l'auteure compl\\u00e9ta son \\u0153uvre par un second volume, sorti en 1869. L'histoire de ces quatre s\\u0153urs a connu d'autant plus de succ\\u00e8s qu'elle a fait \\u00e9cho au quotidien de nombreuses familles am\\u00e9ricaines ayant v\\u00e9cu la guerre de S\\u00e9cession.\\n Ce roman est tir\\u00e9 de l'exp\\u00e9rience personnelle de Louisa May Alcott qui avait trois s\\u0153urs. Par ailleurs, le personnage de Jo semble inspir\\u00e9 de l'auteure elle-m\\u00eame. On peut ainsi consid\\u00e9rer qu'il s'agit d'une autobiographie romanc\\u00e9e.\\n En France, le roman a paru pour la premi\\u00e8re fois en 1880 aux \\u00e9ditions J. Hetzel sous le titre Les Quatre filles du docteur Marsch, traduit et adapt\\u00e9 au go\\u00fbt de l'\\u00e9poque par Pierre-Jules Hetzel sous son nom de plume de P.-J.

En l\\u2019absence de leur p\\u00e8re Robert, pasteur nordiste engag\\u00e9 comme aum\\u00f4nier dans le conflit, quatre jeunes s\\u0153urs issues de la classe moyenne de la soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 font face aux difficult\\u00e9s de la vie quotidienne en ce temps de guerre\\u00a0: la raisonnable Margaret (surnomm\\u00e9e Meg), l'intr\\u00e9pide Josephine (surnomm\\u00e9e Jo), la charitable Elisabeth (surnomm\\u00e9e Beth) et l'orgueilleuse Amy. Elles vivent \\u00e0 Concord dans l'\\u00c9tat du Massachusetts avec leur m\\u00e8re et leur fid\\u00e8le domestique, Hannah. Autrefois riche, la famille March a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 ruin\\u00e9e lorsque Robert March a fait faillite en aidant un ami dans ses affaires.

Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people over cargo. There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. The car is considered an important part of the developed economy.[citation needed]\\n The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor Fran\\u00e7ois Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car\\u2014a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use\\u2014was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, both American cars, are widely considered the first mass-produced and mass-affordable cars, respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages. In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II. In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialised countries.\\n Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than petrol-driven cars before 2025. The transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.\\n There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land-use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and the generation of revenue from taxation. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.\\n The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum \\\"wheeled vehicle\\\" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre \\\"two-wheeled cart\\\", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros \\\"chariot\\\". It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.\\n \\\"Motor car\\\", attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British English. \\\"Autocar\\\", a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning \\\"self-propelled car\\\", is now considered archaic. \\\"Horseless carriage\\\" is attested from 1895.\\n \\\"Automobile\\\", a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek aut\\u00f3s (\\u03b1\\u1f50\\u03c4\\u03cc\\u03c2) \\\"self\\\" and Latin mobilis \\\"movable\\\", entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897. It fell out of favour in Britain and is now used chiefly in North America, where the abbreviated form \\\"auto\\\" commonly appears as an adjective in compound formations like \\\"auto industry\\\" and \\\"auto mechanic\\\".\\n In 1649, Hans Hautsch of Nuremberg built a clockwork-driven carriage. The first steam-powered vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-centimetre-long (26\\u00a0in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger. It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or run.\\n Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle. He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts. His inventions were limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure. In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.\\n The development of external combustion (steam) engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. In the United Kingdom, sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.\\n In 1807, Nic\\u00e9phore Ni\\u00e9pce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyr\\u00e9olophore), but installed it in a boat on the river Saone in France. Coincidentally, in 1807, the Swiss inventor Fran\\u00e7ois Isaac de Rivaz designed his own \\\"de Rivaz internal combustion engine\\\", and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Ni\\u00e9pces' Pyr\\u00e9olophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. Neither design was successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir, who each built vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.\\n In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouv\\u00e9 demonstrated a three-wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity. Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were working on cars at about the same time, the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car\\u2014a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use\\u2014when the German Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen; he is generally acknowledged as the inventor of the car.\\n In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888, Bertha Benz, the wife and business partner of Carl Benz, undertook the first road trip by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband's invention.\\n In 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called boxermotor. During the last years of the 19th century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a joint-stock company. The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world, was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897, the Pr\\u00e4sident automobil.\\n Daimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name Daimler. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895, about 30\\u00a0vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach, and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other's early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35\\u00a0hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\\n In 1890, \\u00c9mile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France. In 1891, Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a petrol-driven vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2,100 kilometres (1,300\\u00a0mi) from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first Paris\\u2013Brest\\u2013Paris bicycle race, but finished six days after the winning cyclist, Charles Terront.\\n The first design for an American car with a petrol internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester, New York. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of 16 years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, Selden was granted a US patent (U.S. patent 549,160) for a two-stroke car engine, which hindered, more than encouraged, development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others, and overturned in 1911.\\n In 1893, the first running, petrol-driven American car was built and road-tested by the Duryea brothers of Springfield, Massachusetts. The first public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon took place on 21 September 1893, on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield. Studebaker, subsidiary of a long-established wagon and coach manufacturer, started to build cars in 1897:\\u200a66\\u200a and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 and petrol vehicles in 1904.\\n In Britain, there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success, with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860. Santler from Malvern is recognised by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first petrol-driven car in the country in 1894, followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895, but these were both one-offs. The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Company, a company founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896, after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines. Lawson's company made its first car in 1897, and they bore the name Daimler.\\n In 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a \\\"New Rational Combustion Engine\\\". In 1897, he built the first diesel engine. Steam-, electric-, and petrol-driven vehicles competed for a few decades, with petrol internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only Mazda's version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success.\\n All in all, it is estimated that over 100,000\\u00a0patents created the modern automobile and motorcycle.\\n Large-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan, and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the US by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world's first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.\\n As a result, Ford's cars came off the line in 15-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower (from 12.5\\u00a0manhours to 1\\u00a0hour 33\\u00a0minutes). It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colours available before 1913, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford's apocryphal remark, \\\"any color as long as it's black\\\". In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.\\n Ford's complex safety procedures\\u2014especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about\\u2014dramatically reduced the rate of injury. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \\\"Fordism\\\" and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the US. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\\n In the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citro\\u00ebn was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.\\n Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910\\u20131911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.\\n Since the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \\\"move up\\\" as their fortunes improved.\\n Reflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared bonnet, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.\\n In Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford's practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss' British subsidiary (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41\\u00a0per cent of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra, had gone under. Citro\\u00ebn did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault's 10CV and Peugeot's 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete. Germany's first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at R\\u00fcsselsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5\\u00a0per cent of the market.\\n In Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companies were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three-wheeled for commercial uses, like Daihatsu, or were the result of partnering with European companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda's decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries, as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation.\\n The transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution, noise pollution and climate change.\\n Most cars in use in the early 2020s run on petrol burnt in an internal combustion engine (ICE). The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers says that, in countries that mandate low sulphur motor spirit, petrol-fuelled cars built to late 2010s standards (such as Euro-6) emit very little local air pollution. Some cities ban older petrol-driven cars and some countries plan to ban sales in future. However, some environmental groups say this phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles must be brought forwards to limit climate change. Production of petrol-fuelled cars peaked in 2017.\\n Other hydrocarbon fossil fuels also burnt by deflagration (rather than detonation) in ICE cars include diesel, autogas, and CNG. Removal of fossil fuel subsidies, concerns about oil dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. This includes hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Out of all cars sold in 2021, nine per cent were electric, and by the end of that year there were more than 16\\u00a0million electric cars on the world's roads. Despite rapid growth, less than two per cent of cars on the world's roads were fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars by the end of 2021. Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use.\\n Oil consumption has increased rapidly in the 20th and 21st centuries because there are more cars; the 1980s oil glut even fuelled the sales of low-economy vehicles in OECD countries. The BRIC countries are adding to this consumption.\\n As of 2023[update] few production cars use wheel hub motors.\\n In almost all hybrid (even mild hybrid) and pure electric cars regenerative braking recovers and returns to a battery some energy which would otherwise be wasted by friction brakes getting hot. Although all cars must have friction brakes (front disc brakes and either disc or drum rear brakes) for emergency stops, regenerative braking improves efficiency, particularly in city driving.\\n Cars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort, and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 21st-century cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation, and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example, the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.\\n Some of the original controls are no longer required. For example, all cars once had controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However, new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. These include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knobs and switches by secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW's iDrive and Ford's MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the early 2020s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.\\n Cars are typically equipped with interior lighting which can be toggled manually or be set to light up automatically with doors open, an entertainment system which originated from car radios, sideways windows which can be lowered or raised electrically (manually on earlier cars), and one or multiple auxiliary power outlets for supplying portable appliances such as mobile phones, portable fridges, power inverters, and electrical air pumps from the on-board electrical system.[a] More costly upper-class and luxury cars are equipped with features earlier such as massage seats and collision avoidance systems.\\n Dedicated automotive fuses and circuit breakers prevent damage from electrical overload.\\n Cars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a boot light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.\\n During the late 20th and early 21st century, cars increased in weight due to batteries, modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and \\\"more-powerful\\u2014if more efficient\\u2014engines\\\" and, as of 2019[update], typically weigh between 1 and 3 tonnes (1.1 and 3.3 short tons; 0.98 and 2.95 long tons). Heavier cars are safer for the driver from a crash perspective, but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users. The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance, with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance. The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, a typical city car, weighs about 700 kilograms (1,500\\u00a0lb). Heavier cars include SUVs and extended-length SUVs like the Suburban. Cars have also become wider.\\n Some places tax heavier cars more: as well as improving pedestrian safety this can encourage manufacturers to use materials such as recycled aluminium instead of steel. It has been suggested that one benefit of subsidising charging infrastructure is that cars can use lighter batteries.\\n Most cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats. Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. Utility vehicles like pickup trucks, combine seating with extra cargo or utility functionality. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, coupe, and minivan.\\n Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Mary Ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown, Ireland, and Henry Bliss one of the US's first pedestrian car casualties in 1899 in New York City. There are now standard tests for safety in new cars, such as the Euro and US NCAP tests, and insurance-industry-backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). However, not all such tests consider the safety of people outside the car, such as drivers of other cars, pedestrians and cyclists.\\n The costs of car usage, which may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance, are weighed against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of the benefits\\u2014perceived and real\\u2014of vehicle usage. The benefits may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience, and emergency power. During the 1920s, cars had another benefit: \\\"[c]ouples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates, plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night.\\\"\\n Similarly the costs to society of car use may include; maintaining roads, land use, air pollution, noise pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life; and can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. Societal benefits may include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of car production and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability of humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.\\n Cars are a major cause of urban air pollution, with all types of cars producing dust from brakes, tyres, and road wear, although these may be limited by vehicle emission standards. While there are different ways to power cars, most rely on petrol or diesel, and they consume almost a quarter of world oil production as of 2019[update]. Both petrol and diesel cars pollute more than electric cars. Cars and vans caused 8% of direct carbon dioxide emissions in 2021. As of 2021[update], due to greenhouse gases emitted during battery production, electric cars must be driven tens of thousands of kilometres before their lifecycle carbon emissions are less than fossil fuel cars; however this varies considerably and is expected to improve in future due to lower carbon electricity, and longer lasting batteries produced in larger factories. Many governments use fiscal policies, such as road tax, to discourage the purchase and use of more polluting cars; and many cities are doing the same with low-emission zones. Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g., hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels.[citation needed] High fuel taxes or cultural change may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars,[citation needed] or to not drive.\\n The lifetime of a car built in the 2020s is expected to be about 16\\u00a0years, or about 2 millionkm (1.2 millionmiles) if driven a lot. According to the International Energy Agency the average rated fuel consumption of new light-duty vehicles fell by only 0.9% between 2017 and 2019, far smaller than the 1.8% annual average reduction between 2010 and 2015. Given slow progress to date, the IEA estimates fuel consumption will have to decrease by 4.3% per year on average from 2019 to 2030. The increase in sales of SUVs is bad for fuel economy. Many cities in Europe have banned older fossil fuel cars and all fossil fuel vehicles will be banned in Amsterdam from 2030. Many Chinese cities limit licensing of fossil fuel cars, and many countries plan to stop selling them between 2025 and 2050.\\n The manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive, and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories, including energy usage, waste and water consumption. Manufacturing each kWh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of petrol. The growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl, therefore encouraging more travel by car, resulting in inactivity and obesity, which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases.\\n Animals and plants are often negatively affected by cars via habitat destruction and pollution. Over the lifetime of the average car, the \\\"loss of habitat potential\\\" may be over 50,000 square metres (540,000\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft) based on primary production correlations.[clarification needed] Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars, referred to as roadkill. More recent road developments are including significant environmental mitigation in their designs, such as green bridges (designed to allow wildlife crossings) and creating wildlife corridors.\\n Growth in the popularity of cars and commuting has led to traffic congestion. Moscow, Istanbul, Bogot\\u00e1, Mexico City and S\\u00e3o Paulo were the world's most congested cities in 2018 according to INRIX, a data analytics company.\\n Mass production of personal motor vehicles in the United States and other developed countries with extensive territories such as Australia, Argentina, and France vastly increased individual and group mobility and greatly increased and expanded economic development in urban, suburban, exurban and rural areas.[citation needed]\\n In the United States, the transport divide and car dependency resulting from domination of car-based transport systems presents barriers to employment in low-income neighbourhoods, with many low-income individuals and families forced to run cars they cannot afford in order to maintain their income. Dependency on automobiles by African Americans may result in exposure to the hazards of driving while black and other types of racial discrimination related to buying, financing and insuring them.\\n Although intensive development of conventional battery electric vehicles is continuing into the 2020s, other car propulsion technologies that are under development include wireless charging, hydrogen cars, and hydrogen/electric hybrids. Research into alternative forms of power includes using ammonia instead of hydrogen in fuel cells.\\n New materials which may replace steel car bodies include aluminium, fiberglass, carbon fiber, biocomposites, and carbon nanotubes. Telematics technology is allowing more and more people to share cars, on a pay-as-you-go basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems. Open-source cars are not widespread.\\n Fully autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, already exist as robotaxis but have a long way to go before they are in general use.\\n Car-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular, in the US and Europe. For example, in the US, some car-sharing services have experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and 2007. Services like car sharing offer residents to \\\"share\\\" a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighbourhoods.\\n The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells the world's motor vehicles, more than three-quarters of which are cars. In 2020, there were 56\\u00a0million cars manufactured worldwide, down from 67\\u00a0million the previous year.\\n The automotive industry in China produces by far the most (20\\u00a0million in 2020), followed by Japan (seven million), then Germany, South Korea and India. The largest market is China, followed by the US.\\n Around the world, there are about a billion cars on the road; they burn over a\\u00a0trillion litres (0.26\\u00d710^12\\u00a0US\\u00a0gal; 0.22\\u00d710^12\\u00a0imp\\u00a0gal) of petrol and diesel fuel yearly, consuming about 50 exajoules (14,000\\u00a0TWh) of energy. The numbers of cars are increasing rapidly in China and India. In the opinion of some, urban transport systems based around the car have proved unsustainable, consuming excessive energy, affecting the health of populations, and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investment. Many of these negative effects fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars. The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems. The car industry is also facing increasing competition from the public transport sector, as some people re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.\\n Established alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transport such as busses, trolleybusses, trains, subways, tramways, light rail, cycling, and walking. Bicycle sharing systems have been established in China and many European cities, including Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programmes have been developed in large US cities. Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted. A study which checked the costs and the benefits of introducing Low Traffic Neighbourhood in London found the benefits overpass the costs approximately by 100 times in the first 20 years and the difference is growing over time.\\n General:\\n \\n Effects:\\n \\n Mitigation:\",\n          \"The Great Gilly Hopkins is a 1978 realistic children's novel by Katherine Paterson.

In 2012 it was ranked number 63 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal \\u2013 the third of three books by Paterson in the top 100.\\n A film adaptation starring Sophie N\\u00e9lisse as Gilly Hopkins and Kathy Bates as Trotter was released in 2015.\\n The novel has been translated into Catalan, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish. \\u00c1rp\\u00e1d G\\u00f6ncz's Hungarian translation has been adapted into a radio play, with Zs\\u00f3fi J\\u00e1vor playing Gilly and M\\u00e1rta F\\u00f3nay playing Trotter.\\n Galadriel \\\"Gilly\\\" Hopkins is a mean, unfriendly 11-year-old girl who is headed for yet another foster home. She hates living with different people all the time and just wants to settle in with her birth mother, Courtney Rutherford Hopkins, whose photograph Gilly secretly treasures. Gilly doesn't like the look of her new foster mom, Mrs. Trotter, a \\\"fat hippo\\\", and decides she is going to hate her whole life.\\n Gilly hatches a plan to escape from Trotter and steals the money she needs for it to work. She knows that her mother lives in San Francisco, California so she writes a letter to Courtney saying that her beloved Galadriel will be with her soon. When Gilly escapes the first time, she gets caught by police and Trotter immediately comes down to the station to retrieve her. Gilly's grandmother, Nonnie, comes to Trotter's house and tells her that she will take Gilly home. Nonnie was previously unaware that she had a granddaughter. By this time Gilly realizes that she really wants to be with Trotter. However, the law says that Gilly must go with Nonnie, so she goes to Nonnie's house.\\n Then Gilly gets good news: her mother is coming. But when she goes to the airport, Courtney is not the woman in Gilly's photograph: she has stringy hair and a lot of other traits Gilly didn't expect, like being selfish. Gilly also finds out that her mother only came because Nonnie paid her, not because she wanted to come. She realizes for the first time how foolish she has been and that she actually loves Trotter. The story ends with Gilly on the phone, crying to Trotter to take her back. Trotter, in turn, gently convinces her that her home is with Nonnie.\\n The Great Gilly Hopkins won various major accolades:\\n The book has been a frequent target of censors; the novel appears on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books between 1990 and 1999 (20), as well as between 2000 and 2009 (52).\\n On February 8, 2013, it was announced that Stephen Herek would direct a film adaptation of the book, with Kathy Bates as Trotter and Danny Glover in major roles.

One warm afternoon, as she wandered beneath the leafy trees, she spotted something quite peculiar—a White Rabbit wearing a waistcoat and peering anxiously at a pocket watch. \\n\\nUtterly fascinated, Alice trailed after the rabbit, who was muttering about being late. He led her to a rabbit hole, and before Alice knew it, she was falling, falling, falling, until she gently landed in a wondrous and whimsical world.\\n\\nIn this topsy-turvy place, Alice found herself in a tiny room with a little door. Through its keyhole, she glimpsed the loveliest garden and longed to explore it. But there was a problem—the door was far too small for Alice to fit through!\\n\\nThen Alice noticed a bottle labeled \"Drink me.\" With a sip, she magically shrank to the perfect size to slip through the door but realized she\\'d forgotten the key on the table! Distressed, Alice ate a cake labeled \"Eat me,\" only to grow so large that she filled the entire room, crying a river of tears.\\n\\nAs her tears filled the room, Alice eventually shrank back down after using a fan she found nearby, joining a group of animals and birds swimming about. They decided to dry off with a quirky \"Caucus Race,\" which was quite different from any race Alice had ever seen!\\n\\nSoon, Alice\\'s adventures took her to a curious house owned by the White Rabbit. Mistaking her for his maid, he sent her to fetch his gloves. Inside, Alice discovered another bottle, growing so tall inside the house that she was almost stuck! She was showered with pebbles that turned into tiny cakes, which she munched to shrink back down again.\\n\\nHer journey led her to a very wise Caterpillar perched on a mushroom, who gave Alice a riddle and told her one side of the mushroom would make her grow, and the other would help her shrink. Alice grabbed pieces of the mushroom and continued on her journey.\\n\\nBefore long, she met a Cheshire Cat, who grinned widely and gave Alice directions to a tea party. There, she found the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and a Dormouse having an endless tea party, where riddles had no answers and time was in a muddle.\\n\\nAlice soon left the silly tea party and found herself in the Queen of Hearts\\' garden, where a croquet game was underway. But it wasn\\'t like any croquet game Alice knew—hedgehogs were the balls, flamingos were mallets, and the Queen was always shouting, \"Off with their heads!\"\\n\\nDespite the Queen\\'s temper, Alice held her own, even during the strange trial of the Knave of Hearts, who was accused of stealing tarts. As the trial grew sillier and sillier, Alice suddenly realized she was growing much too big for Wonderland.\\n\\nEverything began to swirl around her, and just as the Queen\\'s playing cards surrounded her, Alice woke up on the riverbank beside her sister, as if awaking from a most curious dream.\\n\\nAlice\\'s day in Wonderland was filled with fantastical creatures and confounding adventures.

It was Tinker Bell, a tiny fairy with shimmering wings. Hot on her heels was Peter Pan himself, a cheerful boy clad in leaves and cobwebs.

Here, mermaids sang from the lagoons, and the Lost Boys, Peter’s band of merry companions, played games and shared endless fun. But all was not peaceful in Neverland.

In a funny twist of fate, Auntie slipped and fell right into her very own pastry-making machine, becoming a giant cake, much to the delight and giggles of the children.\\n\\nWith kindness in their hearts, the brothers used their treasure to buy the orphanage, turning it into a place filled with laughter, joy, and warmth. Every child found a loving home, and the little hideaway grew into a happy town where the three brothers were not forgotten but celebrated every day, for they had learned that the greatest treasure of all is family and friendship.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None)\n"

Coproduit par les studios Disney, il est le premier long m\\u00e9trage d'animation en images de synth\\u00e8se des studios Pixar. Le sc\\u00e9nario, \\u00e9labor\\u00e9 par Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen et Alec Sokolow, est bas\\u00e9 sur une histoire originale de John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton et Joe Ranft.\\n Le film met en sc\\u00e8ne un groupe de jouets. Woody, une poup\\u00e9e repr\\u00e9sentant un cow-boy, et Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, une figurine d'astronaute, en sont les personnages principaux.\\n Toy Story a produit pr\\u00e8s de 362\\u00a0millions de dollars de recettes dans le monde. Il a re\\u00e7u des critiques tr\\u00e8s positives qui saluent \\u00e0 la fois l'innovation technique de l'animation et la qualit\\u00e9 du sc\\u00e9nario. Depuis 2005 \\u2014 sa premi\\u00e8re ann\\u00e9e d'\\u00e9ligibilit\\u00e9 \\u2014, il fait partie du National Film Registry.\\n En plus des sorties DVD, de nombreux produits d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9s sont apparus sur le march\\u00e9\\u00a0: jouets, jeux vid\\u00e9o, attractions,\\u00a0etc.\\n Le film a fait l'objet de trois suites au cin\\u00e9ma\\u00a0: Toy Story 2 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 \\u00e0 nouveau par John Lasseter en 1999, Toy Story 3 de Lee Unkrich en 2010[NB 1], et Toy Story 4 de Josh Cooley en 2019.\\n La franchise comprend aussi une s\\u00e9rie t\\u00e9l\\u00e9vis\\u00e9e d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9e, Les Aventures de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair (2000-2001) dont Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, le film\\u00a0: Le D\\u00e9but des aventures, long-m\\u00e9trage directement sorti en vid\\u00e9o en 2000, constitue le prologue. Un film d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9, Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, est sorti en salles en 2022.\\n On peut \\u00e9galement retrouver les personnages de Toy Story dans les Toy Story Toons, qui sont trois courts m\\u00e9trages\\u00a0: Vacances \\u00e0 Hawa\\u00ef (2011), Mini Buzz (2011) et Rex, le roi de la f\\u00eate (2012), mais aussi dans deux moyens m\\u00e9trages\\u00a0: Toy Story\\u00a0: Angoisse au motel (2013) et Toy Story\\u00a0: Hors du temps (2014).\\n Dans la chambre d'Andy, ses jouets se mettent \\u00e0 vivre leur propre vie d\\u00e8s qu'il sort de la pi\\u00e8ce. Le jour de son anniversaire, quelques jours avant le d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement de sa famille, c'est la panique puisque chacun craint d'\\u00eatre remplac\\u00e9 par un jouet neuf. Woody le cow-boy est le jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9 du jeune gar\\u00e7on et n'appr\\u00e9hende donc pas tellement cette f\\u00eate. Mais Andy re\\u00e7oit une figurine articul\\u00e9e d'astronaute, Buzz l'\\u00c9clair (\\u00ab\\u00a0Buzz Lightyear\\u00a0\\u00bb en version originale et qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9coise). Tr\\u00e8s vite, il s'av\\u00e8re que Woody a \\u00ab\\u00a0perdu sa place\\u00a0\\u00bb de jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9, au profit de Buzz. Il essaie toutefois d'accueillir Buzz dans le groupe des jouets d'Andy, mais l'astronaute ne sait pas qu'il est un jouet, mais pense qu'il est un Ranger de l'espace, employ\\u00e9 par Star Command et ennemi du terrible empereur Zurg. Il pense aussi qu'il peut voler, ce que Woody conteste. Apr\\u00e8s une \\u00ab\\u00a0d\\u00e9monstration\\u00a0\\u00bb devant les jouets, ceux-ci l'applaudissent, \\u00e0 l'exception de Woody, qui \\u00ab\\u00a0n'appelle pas \\u00e7a voler\\u00a0\\u00bb mais plut\\u00f4t \\u00ab\\u00a0tomber avec panache\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n Alors qu'Andy se pr\\u00e9pare pour aller \\u00e0 Pizza Plan\\u00e8te (\\u00ab\\u00a0Pizza Planet\\u00a0\\u00bb en version originale et qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9coise), sa m\\u00e8re lui dit qu'il ne peut prendre qu'un seul jouet. Woody essaie alors de se d\\u00e9barrasser de Buzz en le faisant tomber dans un coin inaccessible de la chambre, mais \\u00e9choue et Buzz se retrouve projet\\u00e9 \\u00e0 travers la fen\\u00eatre. Les autres jouets commencent alors \\u00e0 penser que Woody, jaloux, a essay\\u00e9 de tuer Buzz. Quant \\u00e0 Andy, ne trouvant plus Buzz, il s'empare de Woody pour aller \\u00e0 Pizza Planet. Buzz voit soudain Andy aller dans la voiture de sa m\\u00e8re avec Woody et grimpe dans le v\\u00e9hicule pour se venger de ce dernier. Lors d'un arr\\u00eat \\u00e0 une station-service, les deux jouets rivaux se battent, quittent m\\u00eame la voiture de la m\\u00e8re d'Andy, qui repart finalement sans eux.\\n Woody trouve un camion Pizza Planet et pr\\u00e9voit alors de monter dedans pour rejoindre Andy. Mais, redoutant le regard des autres jouets s'il revient seul, il demande \\u00e0 Buzz de venir avec lui. Arriv\\u00e9s \\u00e0 destination, les deux jouets finissent dans une machine attrape-peluche, o\\u00f9 Sid, le voisin d'Andy, connu pour \\u00eatre un destructeur de jouets, les capture.\\n Buzz et Woody essaient d\\u00e9sormais de s'enfuir de la maison de Sid avant le d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement d'Andy. Cette maison renferme de nombreux jouets inqui\\u00e9tants ainsi que Scud, le chien m\\u00e9chant de Sid. Buzz voit alors une publicit\\u00e9 pour la gamme de jouets Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, ce qui le choque profond\\u00e9ment. Il veut se prouver qu'il peut voler, mais n'y arrive pas et se casse un bras. D\\u00e9prim\\u00e9, Buzz se sent incapable de participer au plan d'\\u00e9vasion de Woody. Ce dernier essaie d'obtenir l'aide des jouets d'Andy, situ\\u00e9s dans la maison d'en face\\u00a0; mais ceux-ci lui en veulent toujours d'avoir essay\\u00e9 d'\\u00e9carter Buzz. En revanche, les jouets de Sid viennent en aide \\u00e0 Woody en refixant le bras de Buzz, qui se fait ensuite martyriser par Sid. Woody organise alors, avec les jouets de Sid, un plan de sauvetage de Buzz. Mais m\\u00eame apr\\u00e8s tous ces efforts, les deux jouets ne parviennent pas \\u00e0 rattraper la voiture de la m\\u00e8re d'Andy partie pour le d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement.\\n Ils s'accrochent alors au camion de d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement mais sont poursuivis par Scud. En sauvant Woody du chien, Buzz est \\u00e9ject\\u00e9 du camion. Woody essaie de le sauver avec la voiture t\\u00e9l\\u00e9guid\\u00e9e d'Andy, mais les autres jouets ne lui font pas confiance et il est jet\\u00e9 par-dessus bord. Les jouets comprennent leur erreur lorsqu'ils aper\\u00e7oivent Woody et Buzz sur la voiture t\\u00e9l\\u00e9guid\\u00e9e et les aident alors \\u00e0 les ramener sur le camion\\u00a0; mais les piles de la voiture sont \\u00e9puis\\u00e9es et les deux h\\u00e9ros sont oblig\\u00e9s d'allumer la fus\\u00e9e qu'avait fix\\u00e9e Sid sur le dos de Buzz pour d\\u00e9coller. Finalement, la voiture t\\u00e9l\\u00e9guid\\u00e9e rejoint les autres jouets dans le camion et Buzz et Woody rejoignent Andy dans la voiture. La famille et tous les jouets d'Andy arrivent finalement \\u00e0 bon port dans la nouvelle maison. Chaque jouet est \\u00e0 sa place et chacun s'en trouve heureux.\\n Au No\\u00ebl suivant, la s\\u0153ur d'Andy re\\u00e7oit une Madame Patate tandis qu'Andy re\\u00e7oit un v\\u00e9ritable petit chien, ce qui ne rassure pas la tribu des jouets.\\n \\u00a0Sauf indication contraire ou compl\\u00e9mentaire, les informations mentionn\\u00e9es dans cette section peuvent \\u00eatre confirm\\u00e9es par la base de donn\\u00e9es IMDb.\\n \\u00a0Source et l\\u00e9gende\\u00a0: version qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9coise (VQ) sur Doublage.qc.ca\\n \\u00c0 la fin des ann\\u00e9es 1970, John Lasseter entre aux Studios Disney comme animateur et participe \\u00e0 la production de Rox et Rouky (1981). C'est \\u00e0 cette p\\u00e9riode que remonte sa premi\\u00e8re exp\\u00e9rience dans le domaine de l'animation par ordinateur. Deux de ses amis lui font d\\u00e9couvrir la sc\\u00e8ne du Light Cycle, issue du film Tron (1982)[NB 2]. Cette exp\\u00e9rience est une r\\u00e9v\\u00e9lation qui le sensibilise aux possibilit\\u00e9s offertes par l'animation par ordinateur. Lasseter travaille ensuite pour la division Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Group de Lucasfilm Ltd. qui, vendue par George Lucas \\u00e0 Steve Jobs, deviendra Pixar Animation Studios en 1986.\\n Le court-m\\u00e9trage oscaris\\u00e9 Tin Toy (1988) r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 par Lasseter permet \\u00e0 Pixar d'esp\\u00e9rer pouvoir r\\u00e9aliser son premier long m\\u00e9trage mais, comme le studio r\\u00e9alise une perte nette de 8,3\\u00a0millions de $ en 1990, il doit chercher un partenaire financier. La soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 se s\\u00e9pare le 30 avril 1990 de sa division de mat\\u00e9riel informatique.\\n Au d\\u00e9but des ann\\u00e9es 1990, le studio Disney cherche de nouvelles formes d'animation comme l'animation en volume (L'\\u00c9trange No\\u00ebl de monsieur Jack de Henry Selick, 1993) et \\u00e0 am\\u00e9liorer ses techniques de production avec par exemple le projet informatis\\u00e9 CAPS, collaboration entre les deux soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9s, mais aussi \\u00e0 produire un film en images de synth\\u00e8se. Disney a d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 fait quelques utilisations de l'informatique comme dans La Belle et la B\\u00eate (1991). Ces \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments permettent \\u00e0 Disney et Pixar de se rapprocher. Bien que Lasseter soit un ancien de Disney, il pr\\u00e9f\\u00e8re rester chez Pixar et lancer un projet commun.\\n C'est dans le cadre du projet CAPS qu'au d\\u00e9but de l'\\u00e9t\\u00e9 1990, \\u00e0 l'approche de la fin de la production de Bernard et Bianca au pays des kangourous (1990), l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar apprend l'int\\u00e9r\\u00eat de Disney pour une collaboration.\\n Les premi\\u00e8res discussions commencent entre Ed Catmull, Avy Ray Smith et Peter Schneider, pr\\u00e9sident de Walt Disney Feature Animation. Apr\\u00e8s quelques rencontres entre les membres de Pixar et ceux de Disney, c'est Jeffrey Katzenberg, le pr\\u00e9sident du studio Disney, qui prend en main les n\\u00e9gociations. Pixar propose une \\u00e9mission sp\\u00e9ciale d'une demi-heure nomm\\u00e9e A Tin Toy Christmas, pour gagner en exp\\u00e9rience. Mais Katzenberg refuse cette proposition et autorise l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar, lors de leur r\\u00e9union au sein du studio Disney, \\u00e0 rencontrer les animateurs Disney pour les aider \\u00e0 faire non pas un moyen m\\u00e9trage mais un long m\\u00e9trage. Les discussions se poursuivent et aboutissent en mars 1991 \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9criture d'un contrat pour un long m\\u00e9trage bas\\u00e9 sur les personnages de Tin Toy, appel\\u00e9 Toy Story,.\\n Le 3 mai 1991, les deux parties s'accordent sur les termes du contrat, sign\\u00e9 d\\u00e9but juillet. Le journal The Hollywood Reporter r\\u00e9v\\u00e8le l'information le 12 juillet 1991\\u00a0; le contrat pr\\u00e9voit alors aussi deux autres films, aux noms pour le moment ind\\u00e9termin\\u00e9s, en contrepartie de quoi Pixar percevra 10\\u00a0% des b\\u00e9n\\u00e9fices,. Mais le contrat est beaucoup plus pr\\u00e9cis, il comporte plusieurs clauses dont la possibilit\\u00e9 pour Disney d'arr\\u00eater \\u00e0 tout moment le projet (Pixar recevant 350\\u00a0000\\u00a0USD en compensation) ou de r\\u00e9\\u00e9crire son propre sc\\u00e9nario si celui de Pixar ne leur convient pas, et accorde \\u00e0 Disney la totalit\\u00e9 des droits de toutes les productions d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9es. Une autre concerne les producteurs.\\n Le projet permet \\u00e0 Disney de profiter de l'avance de Pixar dans l'image de synth\\u00e8se, tandis que Pixar utilise l'exp\\u00e9rience de Disney dans la production de longs m\\u00e9trages. Le projet commence chez Pixar avec Edwin Catmull (pr\\u00e9sident), John Lasseter, Ralph Guggenheim (producteur) et Bill Reeves (directeur technique). Leur premi\\u00e8re t\\u00e2che a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 de r\\u00e9aliser un film de 30\\u00a0secondes pour tester la technologie. L'\\u00e9quipe, simplement 10\\u00a0personnes dans l'arri\\u00e8re boutique d'un constructeur de mat\\u00e9riel informatique, s'\\u00e9toffe rapidement avec l'arriv\\u00e9e de Peter Docter et Andrew Stanton.\\n Le concept de base du film est d'imaginer l'empilement des jouets d'une chambre d'enfant prendre vie. Selon Lasseter\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Cette chambre est un microcosme urbain, un melting pot pas si emm\\u00eal\\u00e9\\u00a0\\u00bb. En suivant ce concept, la principale t\\u00e2che de l'\\u00e9quipe de production a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 de retrouver l'essence physique et conceptuelle de chaque jouet, sa (ses) mati\\u00e8re(s), ses textures, ses limitations techniques et en fonction de ces contraintes d'imaginer un caract\\u00e8re, une personnalit\\u00e9. Toutefois c'est d'abord \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9quipe du sc\\u00e9nario de chercher une histoire forte et inoubliable.\\n Un premier sc\\u00e9nario arrive rapidement \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9t\\u00e9 1991, mais Katzenberg le rejette car les personnages voulaient la m\\u00eame chose pour les m\\u00eames raisons. Au d\\u00e9part, le premier jouet devait \\u00eatre Tinny, h\\u00e9ros de Tin Toy, mais ce musicien m\\u00e9canique dans son uniforme rouge \\u00e9tait muet et \\u00ab\\u00a0trop vieillot\\u00a0\\u00bb pour devenir le personnage principal,. Une version interm\\u00e9diaire selon Stanton \\u00e9tait con\\u00e7ue comme la nouvelle de Rip Van Winkle, un jouet se r\\u00e9veille sur le bord d'une route et part \\u00e0 la recherche de ses propri\\u00e9taires, c'\\u00e9tait l'id\\u00e9e retenue pour l'\\u00e9mission A Tin Toy Christmas.\\n \\nIl propose alors \\u00e0 Lasseter de faire un buddy movie et de s'inspirer de films comme 48 heures (1982) et La Cha\\u00eene (1958), des films centr\\u00e9s sur deux personnages qui malgr\\u00e9 leur opposition doivent coop\\u00e9rer, gagnant un respect mutuel.  \\u00ab\\u00a0C\\u2019est un genre que personne n\\u2019avait r\\u00e9ellement explor\\u00e9 dans le domaine de l\\u2019animation. Nous y avons vu un grand potentiel pour r\\u00e9aliser un film avec des personnages forts. L\\u2019id\\u00e9e de base d\\u2019un \\u00ab\\u00a0buddy movie\\u00a0\\u00bb, c\\u2019est de mettre en sc\\u00e8ne deux personnages aux caract\\u00e8res r\\u00e9solument oppos\\u00e9s et de les placer dans une situation qui les oblige \\u00e0 collaborer et \\u00e0 se remettre en cause. Cela permet de traduire \\u00e0 l\\u2019image toutes les \\u00e9tapes de leur \\u00e9volution, et cela offre de grandes possibilit\\u00e9s en termes d\\u2019interpr\\u00e9tation.\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0John Lasseter Une nouvelle version du sc\\u00e9nario, \\u00e9crite par Lasseter, Stanton et Docter, est pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9e en septembre 1991 avec Tinny et une marionnette de ventriloque du genre Charlie McCarthy et ayant appartenu au p\\u00e8re d'Andy. L'id\\u00e9e au centre de l'histoire est la confrontation de deux personnages qui d\\u00e9veloppent petit \\u00e0 petit une amiti\\u00e9,. Cette relation entre un ancien et un nouveau jouet permet d'explorer des territoires complexes en \\u00e9motions. La cr\\u00e9ation des personnages principaux, \\u00e0 savoir l'ancien et le nouveau jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9 d'Andy, n'a pas \\u00e9t\\u00e9 ais\\u00e9e.\\n Tinny est ensuite remplac\\u00e9 par une figurine militaire de type G.I. Joe, jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9 de Lasseter, avant de se doter d'un th\\u00e8me spatial, d'apr\\u00e8s le jouet des ann\\u00e9es 1960 Major Matt Mason. De plus, la soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Hasbro a refus\\u00e9 l'usage du G.I. Joe, mais a autoris\\u00e9 celui de M.\\u00a0Patate,. Selon le magazine EW, le refus \\u00e9tait motiv\\u00e9 par la mauvaise image donn\\u00e9e par un personnage G.I. Joe attach\\u00e9 \\u00e0 un p\\u00e9tard M-80, m\\u00eame renomm\\u00e9 Combat Carl. Tinny est alors rebaptis\\u00e9 Lunar Larry puis Tempus from Morph.\\n Les personnages devant s'opposer mais partager des traits communs, afin d'avoir un meilleur sc\\u00e9nario autour de l'astronaute, l'ancien jouet est alors devenu un cow-boy, les deux genres cherchant \\u00e0 conqu\\u00e9rir une fronti\\u00e8re. Il est baptis\\u00e9 Woody d'apr\\u00e8s l'acteur afro-am\\u00e9ricain Woody Strode mais reste une marionnette de ventriloque. Les deux personnages Woody et Tempus sont pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9s en juin 1992 \\u00e0 Disney dans un test de 30\\u00a0secondes. Mais comme Disney souhaite que le film vise \\u00e0 la fois un public jeune et un public adulte, la compagnie demande \\u00e0 revoir les personnalit\\u00e9s de Woody et Tempus et que des r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences pour adultes soient ajout\\u00e9es. Un des probl\\u00e8mes de Woody est que les marionnettes de ventriloque ont r\\u00e9cemment \\u00e9t\\u00e9 associ\\u00e9es aux films d'horreur. Lasseter se base alors sur une poup\\u00e9e de Casper le gentil fant\\u00f4me, munie d'une ficelle pour la voix, pour transformer Woody, r\\u00e9duisant en plus sa taille, tr\\u00e8s proche de celle de Tempus et permettant un meilleur antagonisme. Woody a conserv\\u00e9 une trace de la poup\\u00e9e de ventriloque avec sa corde parlante. Le reste de la personnalit\\u00e9 de Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 d\\u00e9velopp\\u00e9 sur l'acteur choisi pour lui pr\\u00eater sa voix (voir ci-apr\\u00e8s). L'ajout de ce personnage spatial, bri\\u00e8vement nomm\\u00e9 Buzz the spaceman, modifie le sc\\u00e9nario. Finalement le personnage spatial est baptis\\u00e9 Buzz Lightyear (Buzz l'\\u00c9clair), en r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 l'astronaute Buzz Aldrin.\\n Dans les premiers sc\\u00e9narios, le lieu de d\\u00e9tente de la famille \\u00e9tait une combinaison entre une pizzeria et un golf miniature, avec des sc\\u00e8nes comiques autour des \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments du golf. Ce n'est qu'avec l'arriv\\u00e9e de Buzz qu'il se transforme en quelque chose qui peut \\u00e9voquer un spatioport, la pizzeria Pizza Planet, m\\u00e9lange de diner des ann\\u00e9es 1950, d'une salle d'arcade des ann\\u00e9es 1990 et d'un fast-food au d\\u00e9cor de science-fiction. Les plans du restaurant et de sa salle de jeu sont si d\\u00e9taill\\u00e9s qu'ils auraient pu \\u00eatre construits pour de vrai, l'\\u00e9quipe charg\\u00e9e de les concevoir ayant travaill\\u00e9 comme des architectes. En octobre 1992, Joe Ranft rejoint Pixar et aide au d\\u00e9veloppement du sc\\u00e9nario.\\n Le nouveau sc\\u00e9nario de Toy Story est fortement influenc\\u00e9 par les id\\u00e9es du sc\\u00e9nariste Robert McKee, et conna\\u00eet de nombreuses modifications avant d'\\u00eatre finalis\\u00e9. Le sc\\u00e9nario initial est l'\\u0153uvre de Lasseter, Schneider, Schumacher, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter et Joe Ranft, ancien de chez Disney. Comme son contrat l'autorise, Disney fait appel \\u00e0 Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow et, plus tard, Whedon, pour aider le d\\u00e9veloppement du sc\\u00e9nario,.\\n Au bout d'une ann\\u00e9e de production, la productrice Bonnie Arnold vient aider Guggenheim, apportant son exp\\u00e9rience des films d'action comme Danse avec les loups (1990). Son arriv\\u00e9e pr\\u00e9vue par le contrat de juillet 1990 \\u00e9tait un souhait de Disney d'avoir deux producteurs, Guggenheim c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 Pixar et Arnold c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 Disney. Le duo a con\\u00e7u un syst\\u00e8me budg\\u00e9taire pour assurer la productivit\\u00e9 du studio Pixar. Du c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 de chez Disney, Kathleen Gavin assure la coordination des projets sp\\u00e9ciaux en tant que vice-pr\\u00e9sidente, ayant d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 coproduit L'\\u00c9trange No\\u00ebl de monsieur Jack.\\n Joss Whedon vient aider \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9criture du sc\\u00e9nario durant quelques mois avant qu'il soit connu comme le cr\\u00e9ateur de la s\\u00e9rie Buffy contre les vampires (d\\u00e9but\\u00e9e en 1997). Whedon avait propos\\u00e9 de faire de Barbie un personnage qui sauverait Woody et Buzz \\u00e0 la fin du film, dans un tenue de commando \\u00e0 l'image de Sarah Connor dans Terminator 2\\u00a0: Le Jugement dernier, \\u00e9l\\u00e9ment qu'il avait d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 imagin\\u00e9 en 1992 pour le film Buffy, tueuse de vampires,. L'id\\u00e9e fut abandonn\\u00e9e apr\\u00e8s le refus de Mattel, propri\\u00e9taire de la licence Barbie. Le producteur Ralph Guggenheim a d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que Mattel n'avait pas accept\\u00e9 l'utilisation de Barbie dans le film car \\u00ab\\u00a0Mattel pense que les filles qui jouent avec des poup\\u00e9es Barbie projettent leurs personnalit\\u00e9s sur la poup\\u00e9e. Si vous donnez \\u00e0 la poup\\u00e9e une voix et que vous l'animez, vous lui donnez une personnalit\\u00e9 qui ne correspond pas \\u00e0 l'id\\u00e9al de chaque petite fille\\u00a0\\u00bb. Les poup\\u00e9es Barbie appara\\u00eetront, cependant, dans les suites du film, Toy Story 2 et Toy Story 3.\\n Disney a donn\\u00e9 officiellement son feu vert pour le film le 19 janvier 1993, date \\u00e0 laquelle le casting des voix a pu commencer,.\\n Lasseter avait toujours voulu que Tom Hanks soit la voix originale de Woody, affirmant que Hanks \\u00ab\\u00a0a la capacit\\u00e9 de prendre des sentiments et de les rendre \\u00e9mouvants\\u00a0\\u00bb,. M\\u00eame si le personnage, comme celui de Une \\u00e9quipe hors du commun (1992) est pauvre et m\\u00e9prisable.\\u00a0\\u00bb De rapides s\\u00e9ances de test, utilisant la voix de Hanks dans Turner et Hooch (1989), ont convaincu ce dernier de signer pour le film,.\\n Billy Crystal a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 approch\\u00e9 pour la voix de Buzz mais a refus\\u00e9 le r\\u00f4le, ce qu'il a ensuite regrett\\u00e9, bien qu'il ait quelques ann\\u00e9es plus tard jou\\u00e9 la voix originale de Bob Razowski dans un autre succ\\u00e8s de Pixar, Monstres et Cie (2001),. Katzenberg propose alors le r\\u00f4le \\u00e0 Tim Allen, d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 apparu dans la s\\u00e9rie t\\u00e9l\\u00e9vis\\u00e9e Papa bricole, et celui-ci accepte apr\\u00e8s une session de test faite \\u00e0 D\\u00e9troit.\\n Toy Story est le premier r\\u00f4le dans un film d'animation \\u00e0 la fois pour Hanks et pour Allen.\\n Lasseter voulait que Don Rickles fasse la voix de M.\\u00a0Patate. Afin de le persuader, Lasseter, Thomas Schumacher et quelques personnes lui ont rendu visite avec une figurine de M.\\u00a0Patate. Par accident, Lasseter a fait tomber le chapeau melon de la figurine qui, sans cet accessoire, avait une forte ressemblance avec Rickles, chauve. Cet incident a permis de d\\u00e9tendre l'atmosph\\u00e8re et finalement Rickles a accept\\u00e9. La recherche de l'acteur pour Zigzag a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 plus longue car l'\\u00e9quipe cherchait un acteur avec un accent ironique. Ne parvenant pas \\u00e0 trouver ce qu'ils voulaient, un jour Schumacher proposa de changer d'optique et d'avoir un accent rural, ce que l'acteur Jim Varney repr\\u00e9sentait assez bien. Ce dernier accepta. Ce choix a par la suite oblig\\u00e9 les \\u00e9quipes artistiques \\u00e0 modifier l\\u00e9g\\u00e8rement Zigzag (voir ci-apr\\u00e8s).\\n Lasseter ne voulait pas faire de Toy Story un film musical comme l'ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 les pr\\u00e9c\\u00e9dentes productions de Disney telles que La Petite Sir\\u00e8ne (1989), Aladdin ou Le Roi lion. Initialement, Disney avait toutefois voulu privil\\u00e9gier le format musical, faisant valoir que \\u00ab\\u00a0Nous suivons la voie des films musicaux. Les personnages qui se mettent \\u00e0 chanter constituent un raccourci important\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n Disney et Pixar sont finalement parvenus \\u00e0 un accord respectant le choix de Lasseter\\u00a0: pas de com\\u00e9die musicale et pas de personnage qui chante, mais des musiques accompagnant et soulignant l'action. Chris Montan, responsable musical chez Disney depuis le milieu des ann\\u00e9es 1980, contacte Randy Newman pour lui demander d'\\u00e9crire les chansons de Toy Story. Ce dernier n'avait alors jamais compos\\u00e9 de musique pour un film d'animation. Lasseter a d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que \\u00ab\\u00a0Ses musiques sont \\u00e9mouvantes, profondes et satiriques, il apportera une touche \\u00e9motionnelle \\u00e0 chaque sc\\u00e8ne\\u00a0\\u00bb. Newman accepte et pr\\u00e9sente sa premi\\u00e8re composition, Je suis ton ami, le 26 mars 1993 \\u00e0 Lasseter, Guggenheim, Arnold et Montan au si\\u00e8ge de Disney \\u00e0 Burbank. Newman a compos\\u00e9 la chanson phare du film Je suis ton ami (ou T'as trouv\\u00e9 un ami au Qu\\u00e9bec et You've Got a Friend in Me en version originale) en un jour. La chanson la plus difficile \\u00e0 composer selon Newman a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 I Will Go Sailing No More (Jamais plus je ne volerai) en raison du changement de sentiment \\u00e0 rendre en plein milieu, passant \\u00ab\\u00a0d'une lamentation plaintive et mordante \\u00e0 un cri de d\\u00e9fi.\\nLa version fran\\u00e7aise quant \\u00e0 elle, est compos\\u00e9e de onze chansons instrumentales, trois versions fran\\u00e7aises interpr\\u00e9t\\u00e9es par Charl\\u00c9lie Couture et d'une chanson dans sa version originale en anglais.\\n Pixar pr\\u00e9sente un avant-projet du film \\u00e0 Disney le 19 novembre 1993,. Le r\\u00e9sultat est d\\u00e9sastreux car Woody est pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9 comme un \\u00ab\\u00a0imb\\u00e9cile sarcastique\\u00a0\\u00bb, un personnage insupportable. Le pr\\u00e9sident de Walt Disney Feature Animation, Peter Schneider, arr\\u00eate imm\\u00e9diatement la production en attendant qu'un nouveau sc\\u00e9nario soit pr\\u00e9par\\u00e9 et approuv\\u00e9 par Disney. Steve Daly mentionne une r\\u00e9union similaire tenue par Joe Ranft en date du 17 novembre 1993 avec le m\\u00eame r\\u00e9sultat. Il pr\\u00e9cise que l'animation avait d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 commenc\\u00e9 et a d\\u00fb \\u00eatre arr\\u00eat\\u00e9e.\\n Dans cette version, Woody trompe les autres jouets et crie sur Zigzag, pousse intentionnellement Buzz, le m\\u00e8ne vers le jardin de Sid. Lasseter demande alors \\u00e0 Disney d'attendre un peu le temps de modifier le sc\\u00e9nario afin d'\\u00e9viter de devoir licencier toute l'\\u00e9quipe de production chez Pixar et que le studio Disney produise le film seul. Pixar parvient \\u00e0 survivre \\u00e0 cet arr\\u00eat en se repliant sur ses anciennes activit\\u00e9s en attendant que le sc\\u00e9nario soit r\\u00e9\\u00e9crit,.\\n Le nouveau sc\\u00e9nario fait de Woody un personnage plus sympathique, gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 la pr\\u00e9sence du sc\\u00e9nariste et v\\u00e9t\\u00e9ran de l'animation Joe Ranft. Par exemple c'est une lampe Luxo (non vivante), en hommage \\u00e0 Luxo Jr., qui fait tomber Buzz et non Woody. Le film est allong\\u00e9 avec une introduction dans laquelle on voit Andy jouer avec Woody pour apporter plus de sentiments. Pour des besoins de r\\u00e9alisme, ou une \\u00ab\\u00a0cr\\u00e9dibilit\\u00e9 \\u00e9motionnelle\\u00a0\\u00bb selon Steve Daly, du film, de nombreux \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments secondaires ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s, le meilleur exemple \\u00e9tant la publicit\\u00e9 pour Buzz l'\\u00c9clair.\\n Katzenberg red\\u00e9marre alors la production en f\\u00e9vrier 1994,. Aucun employ\\u00e9 n'a donc \\u00e9t\\u00e9 licenci\\u00e9. Les acteurs ont d\\u00fb revenir en mars pour enregistrer les textes du nouveau sc\\u00e9nario. Mais Katzenberg refuse que le titre final du film comporte le terme Toy (\\u00ab\\u00a0jouet\\u00a0\\u00bb) par peur de repousser le public adolescent. En raison de d\\u00e9saccords avec Michael Eisner, alors PDG de Disney, Jeffrey Katzenberg quitte Disney et son rempla\\u00e7ant ne s'oppose pas \\u00e0 l'usage du titre Toy Story.\\n Entre le d\\u00e9but de la production et 1994, l'\\u00e9quipe de 24\\u00a0personnes a grossi pour atteindre 110\\u00a0personnes,. En comparaison, Le Roi lion, sorti en 1994, avait un budget de 45\\u00a0millions de dollars et une \\u00e9quipe de 800\\u00a0personnes. David Price d\\u00e9taille ainsi l'\\u00e9quipe\\u00a0: 27\\u00a0animateurs, 22\\u00a0directeurs techniques, 61\\u00a0artistes et ing\\u00e9nieurs. Mais de nombreux artistes \\u00e9taient en r\\u00e9alit\\u00e9 employ\\u00e9s par une soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 commune \\u00e0 Disney et Pixar nomm\\u00e9e Hi Tech Toons.\\n Durant la production, l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar a fait le choix de ne pas reproduire la r\\u00e9alit\\u00e9 en cherchant \\u00e0 en faire une r\\u00e9plique exacte mais de cr\\u00e9er un monde hyperr\\u00e9el. Lasseter a dit \\u00e0 propos du d\\u00e9fi que repr\\u00e9sentait l'animation par ordinateur\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Chaque feuille et chaque brin d'herbe ont d\\u00fb \\u00eatre cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s.\\u00a0\\u00bb Ce principe est compr\\u00e9hensible avec l'exemple des soldats en plastique. Bien qu'ils ne bougent ni comme de vrais soldats ni comme les jouets en plastique qu'un enfant manipule, ils agissent comme des soldats en plastique vivants. Lui et son \\u00e9quipe avaient pour souci majeur de rendre les jouets authentiques et vivants\\u00a0:\\n \\u00ab\\u00a0La qualit\\u00e9 du jeu des personnages de Toy Story parvient \\u00e0 vous faire croire que les jouets sont vivants. Apr\\u00e8s avoir vu le film, vous ne regarderez plus jamais vos jouets ou ceux de vos enfants comme avant. Finalement, Toy Story n\\u2019est peut-\\u00eatre pas une histoire imaginaire...\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0Ralph Guggenheim, producteur du film L'organisation de l'\\u00e9quipe \\u00e9tait comme une cha\\u00eene de montage similaire \\u00e0 celle en vigueur chez Disney.\\n Le d\\u00e9partement artistique con\\u00e7oit les personnages, les d\\u00e9cors et tous les objets. La cr\\u00e9ation du film a commenc\\u00e9 gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 des storyboards anim\\u00e9s qui aidaient les 27\\u00a0animateurs travaillant sur le film \\u00e0 concevoir les personnages. L'animation par ordinateur de chaque personnage est pass\\u00e9e par une premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9tape, o\\u00f9 chaque personnage a soit \\u00e9t\\u00e9 cr\\u00e9\\u00e9 avec de la p\\u00e2te \\u00e0 modeler, soit \\u00e9t\\u00e9 mod\\u00e9lis\\u00e9 sur un sch\\u00e9ma dessin\\u00e9 \\u00e0 l'ordinateur.\\n Le service de la conception graphique dirig\\u00e9 par Ralph Eggleston et comprenant Bob Pauley, Bill Cone, Tia Kratter et Robin Cooper a eu la charge du niveau de d\\u00e9tail des sc\\u00e8nes, de la lumi\\u00e8re d'ambiance g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale au plus petit d\\u00e9tail des accessoires. Des d\\u00e9tails \\u00e0 peine visibles comme les rayures sur plinthes ou un r\\u00e9veil d\\u00e9r\\u00e9gl\\u00e9 et clignotant dans la chambre d'Andy ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 ajout\\u00e9s pour donner l'impression d'un monde r\\u00e9el.\\n Ces \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments sont mod\\u00e9lis\\u00e9s en 3D par l'un des directeurs techniques soit \\u00e0 partir d'un cahier des charges soit d'une sculpture pour les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments plus complexes (certains jouets ou les humains). Les mod\\u00e8les 3D sont agr\\u00e9ment\\u00e9s de contr\\u00f4les, ou variables d'animation, afin de d\\u00e9finir leurs mouvements et les cons\\u00e9quences d'un mouvement sur leur forme. Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 mod\\u00e9lis\\u00e9 par Bill Reeves et Buzz par Eben Ostby. Les cadreurs ont aussi \\u00e9t\\u00e9 charg\\u00e9s de redimensionner les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s par les artistes, parfois de cr\\u00e9er plusieurs versions d'un m\\u00eame mod\\u00e8le comme le bureau d'Andy dont les d\\u00e9tails du bois apparaissent quand Woody monte dessus.\\n Ensuite, le d\\u00e9partement artistique d\\u00e9finit une sc\\u00e8ne avec sa palette de couleurs et son \\u00e9clairage et le d\\u00e9partement du cadrage positionne les mod\\u00e8les dans la sc\\u00e8ne et les mouvements de cam\\u00e9ra. Il n'a fallu pas moins de neuf sources diff\\u00e9rentes de lumi\\u00e8re pour Woody lorsqu'il regarde par la fen\\u00eatre Buzz qui vient de tomber, en raison de l'heure, celle du coucher de soleil.\\n \\u00c0 plusieurs reprises, le film use de miroirs, de reflets et autres surfaces r\\u00e9fl\\u00e9chissantes (casque de Buzz, r\\u00e9troviseur,\\u00a0etc.). Ce rendu a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 obtenu gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 la cr\\u00e9ation d'un environnement mapp\\u00e9 dans un cube. Les images \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments de la sc\\u00e8ne sont projet\\u00e9es sur les faces int\\u00e9rieures d'un cube qui entoure les personnages\\u00a0; le miroir ne fait alors que r\\u00e9fl\\u00e9chir une des faces du cube sans \\u00eatre oblig\\u00e9 de recr\\u00e9er les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments.\\n La sc\\u00e8ne finale, une course poursuite pour rejoindre la voiture de la famille d'Andy, a n\\u00e9cessit\\u00e9 la cr\\u00e9ation d'un d\\u00e9cor tr\\u00e8s important. Pour simplifier leur t\\u00e2che, l'\\u00e9quipe a cr\\u00e9\\u00e9 un jeu de mod\\u00e8les r\\u00e9utilisables constitu\\u00e9 de 14\\u00a0maisons et 15\\u00a0terrains param\\u00e9trables en couleur, implantation et d\\u00e9cors de jardin, pour un total de 125\\u00a0d\\u00e9clinaisons.\\n Le d\\u00e9partement d'animation (3D) applique alors les principes de base de l'animation pour donner vie aux personnages. Une fois que les animateurs avaient le mod\\u00e8le d'un personnage, les articulations et les mouvements ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 cod\\u00e9s, permettant \\u00e0 chaque personnage de se d\\u00e9placer de diverses mani\\u00e8res, de parler, marcher ou sauter. Chaque articulation, avec le code qui lui est associ\\u00e9, est nomm\\u00e9e avar\\u00a0(en) (animation variable),. Une fois le personnage et ses avars cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s, les animateurs avaient souvent la charge de chercher \\u00e0 \\u00ab\\u00a0briser\\u00a0\\u00bb le personnage, pousser les avars \\u00e0 l'extr\\u00eame pour d\\u00e9tecter les \\u00e9ventuels bugs.\\n Chez Pixar, \\u00e0 l'inverse des habitudes[NB 3] de Disney, un animateur g\\u00e8re une sc\\u00e8ne en entier et non un personnage durant tout le film\\u00a0; toutefois, il y a quelques exceptions. Pour la sc\\u00e8ne dans la station service, Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 anim\\u00e9 par Mark Oftedal et Buzz par Guionne Leroy. L'animateur d\\u00e9finit des points cl\\u00e9s de l'animation, la machine g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rant les \\u00e9tapes interm\\u00e9diaires.\\n De tous les personnages, Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 le plus complexe puisqu'il a n\\u00e9cessit\\u00e9 la cr\\u00e9ation de 723\\u00a0mouvements possibles, dont 212 pour le visage et 58 pour la bouche,.\\n Lasseter a fait le choix de ne pas faire g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rer les mouvements des l\\u00e8vres. Pour synchroniser la voix des acteurs avec les personnages, les animateurs ont pass\\u00e9 une semaine par trame de 8\\u00a0secondes \\u00e0 repasser en d\\u00e9tail sur la bouche des personnages et sur leurs expressions.\\n Apr\\u00e8s cela, les animateurs ont compil\\u00e9 les sc\\u00e8nes et d\\u00e9velopp\\u00e9 un nouveau storyboard avec les personnages anim\\u00e9s par ordinateur. Les animateurs ont ensuite ajout\\u00e9 des ombres, de l'\\u00e9clairage, des effets visuels, et enfin \\u2014 gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 300\\u00a0processeurs informatiques \\u2014 ont donn\\u00e9 au film son apparence finale,. L'\\u00e9quipe responsable des textures, dirig\\u00e9e par Tom Porter, a utilis\\u00e9 l'outil de texturage de RenderMan, le RenderMan Shading Language. L'\\u00e9quipe responsable des \\u00e9clairages, la plus importante en nombre et dirig\\u00e9e par Galyn Susman et Sharon Calahan, a eu \\u00e0 sa disposition de nombreuses possibilit\\u00e9s techniques allant des \\u00e9clairages standards (vie courante), professionnels (cin\\u00e9ma) mais aussi des lumi\\u00e8res sans ombres, d'autres n'\\u00e9clairant qu'un seul objet ou encore des projecteurs d'ombres.\\n Afin de r\\u00e9aliser le rendu de Toy Story, Pixar a utilis\\u00e9 une ferme de serveurs, la Renderfarm. Le film a utilis\\u00e9 un affichage \\u00e0 la r\\u00e9solution de 1\\u00a0536 \\u00d7 922 pixels avec un pixel repr\\u00e9sentant un carr\\u00e9 d'un demi-centim\\u00e8tre pour un \\u00e9cran de salle de cin\\u00e9ma standard. Gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 l'utilisation de l'anticr\\u00e9nelage pour adoucir les traits, une r\\u00e9solution plus grande, estim\\u00e9e \\u00e0 plusieurs milliers de lignes, n'a pas \\u00e9t\\u00e9 n\\u00e9cessaire.\\n Au cours de la post-production, le film a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 envoy\\u00e9 \\u00e0 Skywalker Sound, o\\u00f9 les effets sonores ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 m\\u00e9lang\\u00e9s avec le th\\u00e8me musical. Une s\\u00e9ance de test en public a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9e \\u00e0 San Rafael en 1993.\\n L'apparence de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair est bas\\u00e9e sur les combinaisons port\\u00e9es par les astronautes du programme Apollo et les figurines G.I. Joe,. Sa mentalit\\u00e9 rigide et son inflexibilit\\u00e9, mais aussi sa force de caract\\u00e8re sont dus \\u00e0 la mati\\u00e8re qui le compose, du plastique rigide.\\n Le deuxi\\u00e8me personnage, initialement une poup\\u00e9e de ventriloque, a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 chang\\u00e9 en une poup\\u00e9e cow-boy, le sh\\u00e9rif Woody, nomm\\u00e9e d'apr\\u00e8s l'acteur am\\u00e9ricain de westerns Woody Strode. En apparence, Woody est tr\\u00e8s relax\\u00e9, d\\u00e9tendu, avec un aspect attachant et des valeurs qui nous poussent \\u00e0 avoir confiance en lui. Au contraire de Buzz, Woody n'a pas un moral d'acier\\u00a0; quand son mental flanche, son corps fait de m\\u00eame, c'est \\u00e0 relier au fait que c'est une poup\\u00e9e en tissu.\\n Plus de deux mille croquis de Woody et mille de Buzz ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 n\\u00e9cessaires avant d'aboutir aux personnages que l'on conna\\u00eet, choisis par John Lasseter. Graphiquement, les deux personnages ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 con\\u00e7us avant que Tim Allen et Tom Hanks ne donnent leurs voix\\u00a0; mais selon Bonnie Arnold, plus ils pr\\u00eataient leur voix, plus Buzz et Woody donnaient l'impression d'\\u00eatre Allen et Hanks. Finalement, Woody comprend plus de 1\\u00a0500 avars, bien plus que les 18 de Luxo Jr.\\n Le caract\\u00e8re m\\u00e9content de M.\\u00a0Patate est, comme l'explique Lasseter, d\\u00fb \\u00e0 son int\\u00e9grit\\u00e9 physique, les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments de son visage tombant \\u00e0 longueur de journ\\u00e9e, motif l\\u00e9gitime de m\\u00e9contentement. Ceci fait en plus un parall\\u00e8le avec l'expression am\\u00e9ricaine \\u00ab\\u00a0a chip on his shoulder\\u00a0\\u00bb qui d\\u00e9signe un m\\u00e9contentement, une rumination pour la personne qui doit porter \\u00ab\\u00a0une \\u00e9charde (chip) sur son \\u00e9paule\\u00a0\\u00bb, \\u00e9tant donn\\u00e9 que chip signifie \\u00e9galement \\u00ab\\u00a0tranche\\u00a0\\u00bb et que c'est de l\\u00e0 que vient le mot \\u00ab\\u00a0chips\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n La fragilit\\u00e9 de la poup\\u00e9e de porcelaine La Berg\\u00e8re induit la douce romance avec Woody et ses mouvements d\\u00e9licats, sinon elle casse. Pour Bayonne, comme on place souvent une tirelire en hauteur sur une \\u00e9tag\\u00e8re, il \\u00e9prouve un sentiment de sup\\u00e9riorit\\u00e9 et, en liaison avec l'expression \\u00ab\\u00a0two cents matters\\u00a0\\u00bb, pense avoir souvent raison. Techniquement les deux personnages sont identiques au niveau informatique, un assemblage de formes simples \\u00e0 la surface lisse mais gr\\u00e2ce au logiciel d'ombrage, qui g\\u00e8re la fa\\u00e7on dont une source lumineuse arrive sur une surface, la texture, la \\u00ab\\u00a0peau\\u00a0\\u00bb de Bayonne et celle de la Berg\\u00e8re sont totalement diff\\u00e9rentes.\\n Pour Rex, ses articulations peu nombreuses et limit\\u00e9es l'\\u00e9loignent des monstres de Jurassic Park (1993) ce qui le rend rigide mais aussi provoque son manque de confiance en lui. Sa pr\\u00e9sence dans le film \\u00e9tait justifi\\u00e9e par la forte popularit\\u00e9 des dinosaures et du Tyrannosaurus rex. Afin de renforcer le fait que ce soit un jouet, la texture de sa peau au niveau du cou se brise quand il tourne la t\\u00eate, qui comme c'est un jouet bouge d'un seul bloc. Zigzag, en raison de sa difficult\\u00e9 \\u00e0 se mouvoir par lui-m\\u00eame, a un caract\\u00e8re de suiveur. \\u00c0 l'origine con\\u00e7u comme un chien Jack Russell Terrier, joueur et nerveux, son aspect a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 modifi\\u00e9 avec le choix de l'acteur Jim Varney, ses oreilles ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 allong\\u00e9es, assouplies et d\\u00e9plac\\u00e9es du haut du cr\\u00e2ne vers le c\\u00f4t\\u00e9, ses yeux ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 mis en berne, son cou rapetiss\\u00e9 et il est devenu plus proche du chien de Saint-Hubert, comme Pluto.\\n Le colosse miniature avec des bras disproportionn\\u00e9s est appel\\u00e9 Rocky Gibraltar, c'est une figurine de catch. Pour animer les soldats en plastique, Pete Docter a demand\\u00e9 \\u00e0 une partie des artistes d'attacher chacun des vieilles chaussures \\u00e0 une planche et de marcher avec. Apr\\u00e8s plusieurs s\\u00e9ries de pas et sauts dans le hall du studio, les animateurs ont r\\u00e9ussi \\u00e0 imaginer les mouvements des soldats. De m\\u00eame, de nombreuses tentatives ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9es pour comprendre l'ouverture du parachute et les mouvements lors d'une descente du second \\u00e9tage d'un soldat parachutiste miniature suspendu par le casque.\\n Pour repr\\u00e9senter les humains, le d\\u00e9fi de l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 comparable \\u00e0 celui pour Blanche-Neige et les Sept Nains (1937) car personne n'avait encore r\\u00e9ussi \\u00e0 reproduire un humain convaincant, or il fallait ici en cr\\u00e9er quatre. Le premier personnage humain le plus approchant de ce que les animateurs voulaient \\u00e9tait le b\\u00e9b\\u00e9 dans Tin Toy. La difficult\\u00e9 provient surtout de la conjonction de la peau et des v\\u00eatements\\u00a0; ainsi, pour reproduire les mouvements du visage et du T-shirt de Sid, garde-robe qui ne d\\u00e9passe pas un total de 50\\u00a0$ (dans la vie r\\u00e9elle), il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 n\\u00e9cessaire \\u00ab\\u00a0d'afficher plus de lignes qu'un \\u00e9cran de contr\\u00f4le a\\u00e9rien\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n Le chien de Sid, Scud, est anim\\u00e9 gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 178 avars mais certains comme ceux des oreilles et de la queue ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 tr\\u00e8s souvent utilis\\u00e9s, au contraire de ceux des dents. Les jouets mutants, \\u00ab\\u00a0r\\u00e9par\\u00e9s\\u00a0\\u00bb par Sid, sont parmi les derniers \\u00e0 avoir \\u00e9t\\u00e9 con\\u00e7us et model\\u00e9s. Et pour beaucoup ils r\\u00e9utilisent des \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments con\\u00e7us pour les jouets d'Andy comme le torse de Rocky Gibraltar pour le mutant \\u00e0 t\\u00eate d'insecte ou le skateboard d'Andy en version miniature pour RollerBob.\\n Le budget initial fourni par Disney \\u00e9tait de 17,5\\u00a0millions d'USD avec une sortie pr\\u00e9vue pour 1994. Mais d\\u00e8s 1994, le budget de Disney atteint les 21,5\\u00a0millions, et 6\\u00a0millions sont encore n\\u00e9cessaires. De son c\\u00f4t\\u00e9, Steve Jobs, qui avait achet\\u00e9 Pixar pour 10\\u00a0millions d'USD, a investi plus de 50\\u00a0millions sans atteindre la rentabilit\\u00e9. Disney demande \\u00e0 Pixar de faire un cr\\u00e9dit de 3\\u00a0millions d'USD garanti sur les fonds personnels de Jobs. Steve Jobs tente de renflouer Pixar en faisant un partenariat avec Microsoft.\\n Finalement la cr\\u00e9ation du film a n\\u00e9cessit\\u00e9 un budget de 30\\u00a0millions de dollars. Avant la sortie du film, le producteur ex\\u00e9cutif du film Steve Jobs avait d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que \\u00ab\\u00a0Si Toy Story remporte un succ\\u00e8s mod\\u00e9r\\u00e9 \\u2014 disons 75\\u00a0millions de $ au box-office \\u2014 on [Pixar et Disney] atteindra le seuil de rentabilit\\u00e9. S'il en recueille 100\\u00a0millions, on gagnera de l'argent. Mais si c'est un vrai blockbuster et qu'il rapporte 200\\u00a0millions ou \\u00e0 peu pr\\u00e8s, on va se faire beaucoup d'argent.\\u00a0\\u00bb Le pr\\u00e9sident de Disney Michael Eisner avait lui d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que \\u00ab\\u00a0La technologie est brillante, les voix sont inspir\\u00e9es et je pense que l'histoire va toucher la corde sensible des gens. Croyez-moi, lorsqu'on a pour la premi\\u00e8re fois accept\\u00e9 de travailler ensemble, on ne pensait vraiment pas que leur premier film serait notre sortie de l'\\u00e9t\\u00e9 1995\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n En d\\u00e9cembre 1994, Guggenheim rencontre un directeur de Disney Consumer Products (DCP) et d\\u00e9couvre l'absence d'une gamme de produits d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9s. Cette absence \\u00e9tait due \\u00e0 un calendrier charg\\u00e9 en productions chez Disney, avec Pocahontas (1995) et Le Bossu de Notre-Dame (1996) ainsi qu'\\u00e0 une incompr\\u00e9hension, d'apr\\u00e8s laquelle Toy Story n'aurait pas de personnages originaux.\\n En janvier 1995, Peter Schneider annonce la sortie de Toy Story pour novembre 1995 ne laissant que la moiti\\u00e9 du temps habituel pour concevoir une gamme. De plus, Mattel et Hasbro d\\u00e9clinent l'offre de produire des jouets. Disney trouve un fabricant qui accepte de produire les jouets, Toy Fair, une soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 de Toronto avec une succursale en Chine nomm\\u00e9e Thinkway Toys, sp\\u00e9cialis\\u00e9e dans les tirelires parlantes. C'est aussi en janvier que Lasseter rencontre Albert Chan, propri\\u00e9taire de Thinkway et principal cr\\u00e9ateur. Chan propose une gamme de jouets bas\\u00e9e sur des figurines de 6\\u00a0pouces (15,2\\u00a0cm), moiti\\u00e9 moins que le format des G.I. Joe souhait\\u00e9 par Lasseter pour Buzz. Chan r\\u00e9pond que ce format ne se fait plus mais Lasseter insiste arguant que le public voudra les personnages du film. D\\u00e9but mars, Chan revient avec des figurines, 12\\u00a0pouces (30,5\\u00a0cm) pour Buzz et 15\\u00a0pouces (38,1\\u00a0cm) pour Woody et Lasseter l'emm\\u00e8ne dans une salle de projection du studio o\\u00f9 le film \\u00e9tait projet\\u00e9. Selon les souvenirs de Lasseter, les employ\\u00e9s du studio sont alors devenus hyst\\u00e9riques. Eben Osby, modeleur de Buzz, a bondi de son si\\u00e8ge, travers\\u00e9 la salle en courant pour prendre la figurine des mains de Lasseter. Mais les cha\\u00eenes de magasins n'ont pas partag\\u00e9 l'enthousiasme des employ\\u00e9s\\u00a0: Walmart ne commercialisa pas la figurine, Toys \\\"R\\\" Us et Disney Store n'ont eux command\\u00e9 pour les \\u00c9tats-Unis que 60\\u00a0000\\u00a0figurines de Buzz et 45\\u00a0000 de Woody. Lasseter demanda la cr\\u00e9ation de 250\\u00a0000\\u00a0figurines de chaque, mena\\u00e7ant de les produire \\u00e0 ses frais. Une semaine avant la sortie du film, ce stock \\u00e9tait d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 \\u00e9coul\\u00e9. Les commandes de figurines de Buzz ont atteint les 1,6\\u00a0million apr\\u00e8s une semaine de diffusion. En 2007, on comptait 25\\u00a0millions de figurines vendues, tous personnages confondus.\\n Toy Story a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 au centre d'une grande campagne de marketing avant sa sortie qui mettait en avant des images du film, par exemple sur les emballages alimentaires. Une grande diversit\\u00e9 de produits d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9s est sortie durant l'exploitation en salles du film et durant sa sortie en VHS dont des jouets, des v\\u00eatements ou des chaussures.\\n Disney a d\\u00e9pens\\u00e9 20\\u00a0millions de dollars pour le marketing autour du film\\u00a0; Burger King, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola et Payless ShoeSource ont eux d\\u00e9pens\\u00e9 125\\u00a0millions de dollars dans des op\\u00e9rations mettant en jeu la promotion autour du film,. The New York Times d\\u00e9taille quelques-unes des d\\u00e9penses\\u00a0: 45\\u00a0millions de dollars pour Burger King, 75\\u00a0\\u00e0 80\\u00a0millions de sachets promotionnels chez Frito-Lay, filiale de PepsiCo, tandis que Coca-Cola a propos\\u00e9 des promotions sur la gamme Minute Maid (alors en perte de vitesse).\\n Un consultant marketing a dit \\u00e0 propos de cette promotion\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Comment un enfant, assis devant un film d'une heure et demie mettant en sc\\u00e8ne une foule de jouets reconnaissables \\u00e0 l'\\u0153il, pourra ne pas vouloir en poss\\u00e9der un\\u00a0?\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n \\n AllMusic\\u00a0: \\n modifier  Classements\\u00a0:\\n La premi\\u00e8re de Toy Story a eu lieu le 19 novembre 1995 \\u00e0 Hollywood, en Californie dans le El Capitan Theatre.

Le tout premier court-m\\u00e9trage de Pixar, Les Aventures d'Andr\\u00e9 et Wally B., \\u00e9tait projet\\u00e9 avant chaque diffusion du film dans tous les cin\\u00e9mas.\\n \\u00a0Sauf indication contraire ou compl\\u00e9mentaire, les informations mentionn\\u00e9es dans cette section peuvent \\u00eatre confirm\\u00e9es par la base de donn\\u00e9es IMDb.\\n Dans la plupart de ces pays, le film est ressorti dans une version en relief (projection en relief st\\u00e9r\\u00e9oscopique) et a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9 avec Toy Story 2, avant la sortie du troisi\\u00e8me volet.\\n \\u00c0 sa sortie, Toy Story \\u00e9tait la seule production de Pixar qui arborait uniquement le logo de Disney, malgr\\u00e9 la collaboration des deux entreprises sur le film. Cependant, depuis l'acquisition compl\\u00e8te de Pixar par The Walt Disney Company en 2006, Toy Story \\u2014 tout comme les autres films produits par Pixar \\u2014 fait d\\u00e9sormais figurer la marque Disney\\u2022Pixar.\\n Toy Story a re\\u00e7u un accueil critique tr\\u00e8s favorable par les critiques du monde entier.

Sa premi\\u00e8re sortie en DVD remonte au 17 octobre 2000, o\\u00f9 il \\u00e9tait inclus dans un pack avec Toy Story 2 (avant d'\\u00eatre plus tard disponible individuellement). \\u00c9galement le 17 octobre 2000, un ensemble de trois DVD est sorti, l\\u2019Ultimate Toy Box, compos\\u00e9 de Toy Story, Toy Story 2 et un DVD de bonus. Le 6 septembre 2005, un double-DVD en l'honneur du dixi\\u00e8me anniversaire de la s\\u00e9rie est sorti, contenant une grande partie des bonus de l\\u2019Ultimate Toy Box.\\n Toy Story a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 disponible en format Blu-ray pour la premi\\u00e8re fois dans le Special Edition Combo Pack qui contenait deux disques\\u00a0: le film en format Blu-ray et le film en format DVD, et qui est sorti le 23 novembre 2010.\\n R\\u00e9compenses\\n Nominations\\n Ce premier long-m\\u00e9trage des studios Pixar marque un tournant dans l'histoire du dessin anim\\u00e9\\u00a0: c'est le premier film enti\\u00e8rement r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 en images de synth\\u00e8se 3D\\u00a0; coproduit par les studios Disney, il inaugure une suite de succ\\u00e8s parmi lesquels 1001 pattes (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monstres et Cie (2001), Le Monde de Nemo (2003), Les Indestructibles (2004), Cars (2006), Ratatouille (2007), WALL-E (2008), L\\u00e0-haut (2009) et Toy Story 3 (2010).\\n Amor\\u00e7ant une tradition chez les studios Pixar, Toy Story renferme de multiples clins d'\\u0153il \\u00e0 l'industrie du cin\\u00e9ma. Par exemple, la th\\u00e9i\\u00e8re qu'utilise Hannah quand elle joue avec Buzz est une r\\u00e9plique de la th\\u00e9i\\u00e8re de l'Utah, mod\\u00e8le utilis\\u00e9 dans la synth\\u00e8se d'image 3D qui est devenu un objet standard de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence dans la communaut\\u00e9 de la synth\\u00e8se d'image. De nombreux clins d'\\u0153il sont plus particuli\\u00e8rement port\\u00e9s sur l'entreprise Disney. Lorsque Buzz veut prouver \\u00e0 Woody qu'il sait voler, une image de Mickey Mouse est cach\\u00e9e sur une r\\u00e9plique g\\u00e9ante de montre. Enfin, vers la fin du film, quand Woody et Buzz arrivent pr\\u00e8s de la voiture d'Andy en roulant et qu'on les voit dans le r\\u00e9troviseur, on peut entendre la chanson Hakuna matata du film d'animation Le Roi lion, sorti un an auparavant.\\n Le film est aussi parsem\\u00e9 de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences \\u00e0 l'histoire de Pixar et \\u00e0 ses courts m\\u00e9trages pass\\u00e9s. Quand le livreur de Pizza Planet entre dans la station-service Dinoco, il demande o\\u00f9 se situe le West Cutting Boulevard. C'\\u00e9tait en fait l'adresse des studios d'animation Pixar \\u00e0 Richmond (Californie), \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9poque de la r\\u00e9alisation du film. Depuis 2000, les studios ont d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nag\\u00e9 \\u00e0 Emeryville (Californie). La lampe de bureau et le ballon jaune avec une \\u00e9toile rouge font r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence au premier court-m\\u00e9trage de Pixar, Luxo Jr. (1986),. Dans la sc\\u00e8ne o\\u00f9 Woody invite les jouets \\u00e0 se trouver un partenaire de d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement, on peut apercevoir en arri\\u00e8re-plan sur une \\u00e9tag\\u00e8re un livre intitul\\u00e9 Tin Toy dont l'auteur mentionn\\u00e9 est Lasseter (une r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 John Lasseter). C'est de ce court-m\\u00e9trage r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 en 1988 par Lasseter que Toy Story est inspir\\u00e9. On trouve aussi un livre nomm\\u00e9 Knick Knack, autre court m\\u00e9trage de Pixar, datant lui de 1989.\\n Toy Story marque \\u00e9galement le d\\u00e9but d'une longue liste d'apparitions d'objets r\\u00e9currents dans les films sign\\u00e9s Pixar. Le code A113, qui \\u00e9tait \\u00e0 l'origine le num\\u00e9ro d'une classe de CalArts (\\u00e9cole o\\u00f9 ont travaill\\u00e9 John Lasseter et Brad Bird) et qui appara\\u00eetra dans tous les autres longs m\\u00e9trages de Pixar, appara\\u00eet dans le film, sur la plaque d'immatriculation du monospace de la m\\u00e8re d'Andy. Figure \\u00e9galement dans le film la compagnie Dinoco, qui sera aussi pr\\u00e9sente dans Cars et WALL-E, ainsi que la cha\\u00eene de pizzerias Pizza Planet, dont le camion appara\\u00eetra dans la quasi-int\\u00e9gralit\\u00e9 des longs m\\u00e9trages de Pixar. Quand Luxo Junior bouscule Buzz par la fen\\u00eatre ouverte, celui-ci pousse le c\\u00e9l\\u00e8bre cri Wilhelm qui pourra \\u00eatre entendu \\u00e9galement dans Toy Story 3.\\n Le sol o\\u00f9 se trouvent Woody et Buzz quand ils tentent de s'\\u00e9chapper de la maison de Sid fait r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 celui de l'h\\u00f4tel Overlook dans Shining.\\n Diff\\u00e9rents auteurs ont vu de l'humanisme dans le film et l'ont rapproch\\u00e9 du roman Don Quichotte,. Bruce R. Burningham a \\u00e9tabli des comparaisons entre les personnages des deux \\u0153uvres. Ainsi, Buzz l'\\u00c9clair se rapprocherait de Don Quichotte alors que Woody est compar\\u00e9 \\u00e0 Sancho Panza. Burningham avance que ce dernier, au cours du film, \\u00e9prouve des difficult\\u00e9s dues \\u00e0 ses rapports avec Buzz, un nouveau venu plein d'illusions. Rossinante, le cheval de Don Quichotte, serait devenu le vaisseau spatial accident\\u00e9 de Buzz. Il souligne toutefois que Dulcin\\u00e9e n'a pas d'\\u00e9quivalent dans le film de Pixar. Pour lui, cela vient du fait que dans la tradition chevaleresque, chaque chevalier a une femme \\u00e0 qui il peut se confier, tandis que les codes de la science-fiction ne pr\\u00e9voient pas de personnage qui aurait un tel r\\u00f4le vis-\\u00e0-vis des rangers de l'espace.\\n Burningham met \\u00e9galement en \\u00e9vidence un lien entre les histoires de Toy Story et de Don Quichotte\\u00a0: comme Don Quichotte, dont la g\\u00e9n\\u00e9alogie est d\\u00e9lib\\u00e9r\\u00e9ment ambigu\\u00eb, Buzz n'a pas de v\\u00e9ritable histoire avant le d\\u00e9but du film. Il se r\\u00e9veille ex nihilo de son \\u00ab\\u00a0hypersomnolence\\u00a0\\u00bb, aussi vite qu'Alonso Quichano se d\\u00e9couvre une nouvelle identit\\u00e9 dans le premier chapitre. Plus loin dans le film, Buzz essaie de trouver un \\u00ab\\u00a0vaisseau\\u00a0\\u00bb pour revenir sur sa \\u00ab\\u00a0plan\\u00e8te\\u00a0\\u00bb pendant que Woody tente de trouver un moyen de revenir avec Buzz dans la chambre d'Andy, et ce en se servant des illusions de Buzz. Pour Burningham, cette situation est calqu\\u00e9e sur le sch\\u00e9ma narratif du roman de Cervantes, o\\u00f9 Sancho, tout comme Woody, apprend vite \\u00e0 se servir des r\\u00eaves de son ma\\u00eetre pour arriver \\u00e0 ses propres fins.\\n Toy Story a eu un impact important sur l'industrie cin\\u00e9matographique de par le c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 innovant de l'animation en images de synth\\u00e8se. Apr\\u00e8s la sortie du film, diverses industries se sont int\\u00e9ress\\u00e9es \\u00e0 la technologie utilis\\u00e9e dans le film. Les fabricants de cartes graphiques ont souhait\\u00e9 pouvoir cr\\u00e9er des images similaires \\u00e0 celles du film pour les ordinateurs personnels, les d\\u00e9veloppeurs de jeu vid\\u00e9o ont voulu apprendre \\u00e0 reproduire ce type d'animation dans leurs jeux et les chercheurs en robotique se sont pench\\u00e9s sur la mise en place d'une intelligence artificielle dans leurs robots pour que ceux-ci aient un comportement proche de celui des personnages du film.\\n \\nD'apr\\u00e8s Jason Bosse, \\u00ab\\u00a0tous ceux qui travaillent dans l'animation traditionnelle ont compris qu'il fallait se surpasser, faire jouer les personnages de fa\\u00e7on plus vraie, et non pas se contenter du style traditionnel qui \\u00e9tait appliqu\\u00e9 depuis 20\\u00a0ans\\u00a0\\u00bb .  \\u00ab\\u00a0Nous n'aurions pas pu faire ce film par la voie de l'animation traditionnelle. C'est une histoire qui ne peut \\u00eatre racont\\u00e9e qu'avec des personnages en trois dimensions\\u2026 Certains des plans du film sont si beaux.\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0Tom Schumacher, vice-pr\\u00e9sident de Walt Disney Feature Animation Le personnage de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair et sa phrase phare, \\u00ab\\u00a0Vers l'infini et au-del\\u00e0\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb (au Qu\\u00e9bec, \\u00ab\\u00a0Vers l'infini et plus loin encore\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb), ont particip\\u00e9 \\u00e0 la renomm\\u00e9e du film. Le personnage est si populaire qu'en 2008, des astronautes ont emmen\\u00e9 une figurine de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair dans l'espace \\u00e0 bord de la navette spatiale Discovery pour le tournage d'un film p\\u00e9dagogique.\\n La phrase \\u00ab\\u00a0Vers l'infini et au-del\\u00e0\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb est apparue sur plusieurs tee-shirts tir\\u00e9s du film. De par sa grande popularit\\u00e9, elle a m\\u00eame \\u00e9t\\u00e9 utilis\\u00e9e par quelques philosophes et math\\u00e9maticiens dans leurs publications,,. En 2008, cette phrase a de nouveau fait le tour des nouvelles mondiales lorsqu'on a appris qu'un p\\u00e8re et son fils, tout au long des 15\\u00a0heures pendant lesquelles ils ont nag\\u00e9 dans l'oc\\u00e9an Atlantique, avaient continuellement r\\u00e9p\\u00e9t\\u00e9 cette phrase afin de ne pas se perdre mutuellement,.\\n Buzz ainsi que les autres personnages du film font d\\u00e9sormais partie de la culture populaire\\u00a0: Debian, un syst\\u00e8me d'exploitation libre pour ordinateur, \\u00e0 la suite de la d\\u00e9cision de Bruce Perens le chef de projet de l'\\u00e9poque qui travaillait aussi pour Pixar, a baptis\\u00e9 ses versions successives des noms des personnages du film\\u00a0; \\u00e0 savoir Buzz, Rex, Bo, Hamm, Slink, Potato, Woody, Sarge, Etch, Lenny, Squeeze, Wheezy, Jessie, Etch, Sid et Buster. Le logo en forme de spirale de Debian serait inspir\\u00e9, selon Martin Krafft par la forme particuli\\u00e8re du menton de Buzz.\\n La bande originale de Toy Story a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 produite par Walt Disney Records et est sortie le 22 novembre 1995, la semaine de la sortie du film. Compos\\u00e9e et \\u00e9crite par Randy Newman, la bande originale a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 lou\\u00e9e pour sa musique \\u00ab\\u00a0vive et remuante\\u00a0\\u00bb.

Cependant, comme l'histoire \\u00e9tait consid\\u00e9r\\u00e9e assez bonne pour ne pas sortir directement en vid\\u00e9o, il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 annonc\\u00e9 en 1998 que la suite sortirait en salles. L'enregistrement des voix de Toy Story 2, dans lequel Woody est vol\\u00e9 durant un vide-greniers, a vu le retour de la majorit\\u00e9 des voix pr\\u00e9sentes dans le premier volet.

Ce travail a dur\\u00e9 quatre mois, et il a fallu six mois suppl\\u00e9mentaires pour ajouter la 3D aux deux films. Le principal st\\u00e9r\\u00e9ographe Bob Whitehill a supervis\\u00e9 ce travail en cherchant \\u00e0 obtenir un rendu qui ait une influence \\u00e9motionnelle sur la narration du film\\u00a0:\\n \\u00ab\\u00a0Pour chercher les meilleures fa\\u00e7ons d'utiliser la 3D au profit de l'histoire d'un film, je regarde le film dans son ensemble. Par exemple, dans Toy Story, lorsque les jouets sont seuls dans leur monde, je voulais rendre l'impression d'un monde o\\u00f9 l'on vit en s\\u00e9curit\\u00e9. Et lorsqu'ils sortent dans le monde des hommes, c'est l\\u00e0 que je fais r\\u00e9ellement intervenir la 3D pour bien refl\\u00e9ter le fait que ce monde est dangereux, compliqu\\u00e9 et bouleversant.\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0Bob Whitehill La reprise en 3D du film a obtenu de bons r\\u00e9sultats au box-office am\\u00e9ricain, recueillant 12\\u00a0491\\u00a0789\\u00a0$ lors du premier week-end d'exploitation, le pla\\u00e7ant alors troisi\\u00e8me derri\\u00e8re Bienvenue \\u00e0 Zombieland et Temp\\u00eate de boulettes g\\u00e9antes.\\n En novembre 1996, le spectacle sur glace Disney on Ice\\u00a0: Toy Story a ouvert ses portes.

Pour les autres significations, voir Alice au pays des merveilles (homonymie).\\n \\n Les Aventures d'Alice au pays des merveilles (titre original\\u00a0: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland), fr\\u00e9quemment abr\\u00e9g\\u00e9 en Alice au pays des merveilles, est un roman publi\\u00e9 en 1865 par Lewis Carroll. Il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 traduit en fran\\u00e7ais pour la premi\\u00e8re fois en 1869 par la m\\u00eame maison d'\\u00e9dition (Macmillan and Co).\\n Lors de sa premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9criture, le livre n'\\u00e9tait pas destin\\u00e9 aux enfants. L'\\u00e9criture fut reprise une seconde fois pour les enfants en conservant les personnages merveilleux qui la rendaient si attrayante pour ce jeune public. Le roman foisonne d'allusions satiriques aux amis de l'\\u00e9crivain et aux le\\u00e7ons que les \\u00e9coliers britanniques devaient m\\u00e9moriser \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9poque. Le pays des merveilles d\\u00e9crit dans le conte joue sans cesse avec la logique. L'ouvrage reste populaire au XXIe\\u00a0si\\u00e8cle, aussi bien aupr\\u00e8s des enfants que des adultes.\\n Le livre a connu une suite intitul\\u00e9e De l'autre c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 du miroir. Les adaptations cin\\u00e9matographiques combinent souvent des \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments des deux livres. L'\\u00e9crivain am\\u00e9ricain Martin Gardner a publi\\u00e9 The Annotated Alice, qui regroupe Alice au pays des merveilles et De l'autre c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 du miroir accompagn\\u00e9s des po\\u00e8mes victoriens que Lewis Carroll parodia dans le corps du texte.\\n Le livre a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 publi\\u00e9 le 4 juillet 1865, trois ans jour pour jour apr\\u00e8s une promenade en barque sur l'Isis (qui coule \\u00e0 Oxford) effectu\\u00e9e par les r\\u00e9v\\u00e9rends Dodgson (Carroll) et Robinson Duckworth en compagnie de trois jeunes filles\\u00a0:\\n L'excursion commen\\u00e7a au pont Folly pr\\u00e8s d'Oxford et finit une dizaine de kilom\\u00e8tres plus loin dans le village de Godstow. Durant le trajet, Dodgson raconta aux s\\u0153urs Liddell une histoire qu'il venait d'inventer. Celle-ci fut suivie plus tard par Alice's Adventures Underground et finit par devenir Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\\n En 1998, un exemplaire de la premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9dition a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 vendu 1,5 million de dollars, ce qui est une vente record pour un livre pour enfants. Seuls vingt-deux exemplaires de la premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9dition de 1865 auraient surv\\u00e9cu. Dix-sept d'entre eux se trouvent dans des biblioth\\u00e8ques et cinq chez des particuliers.\\n Alice s'ennuie aupr\\u00e8s de sa s\\u0153ur qui lit un livre (\\u00ab\\u00a0sans images, ni dialogues\\u00a0\\u00bb) tandis qu'elle ne fait rien. \\u00ab\\u00a0\\u00c0 quoi bon un livre sans images, ni dialogues\\u00a0?\\u00a0\\u00bb, se demande Alice. Mais voil\\u00e0 qu'un lapin blanc aux yeux roses v\\u00eatu d'une redingote avec une montre \\u00e0 gousset \\u00e0 y ranger passe pr\\u00e8s d'elle en courant. Cela ne l'\\u00e9tonne pas le moins du monde. Pourtant, lorsqu'elle le voit sortir une montre de sa poche et s'\\u00e9crier\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Je suis en retard\\u00a0! En retard\\u00a0! En retard\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb, elle se dit que d\\u00e9cid\\u00e9ment ce lapin a quelque chose de particulier. En entrant derri\\u00e8re lui dans son terrier, elle fait une chute presque interminable qui l'emm\\u00e8ne dans un monde aux antipodes du sien. Elle va rencontrer une galerie de personnages retors et se trouver confront\\u00e9e au paradoxe, \\u00e0 l'absurde et au bizarre\\u2026\\n Alice suit un lapin dans son terrier. Puis elle trouve une cl\\u00e9 qui m\\u00e8ne \\u00e0 un joli jardin. Elle boit une boisson \\u00e9tiquet\\u00e9e \\\"bois-moi\\\" et mange un g\\u00e2teau \\u00e9tiquet\\u00e9 \\\"mange-moi\\\" qui la fait r\\u00e9tr\\u00e9cir afin qu'elle puisse entrer dans le jardin.\\n Alice rencontre une souris fran\\u00e7aise et elle essaie de converser en fran\\u00e7ais \\u00e9l\\u00e9mentaire. Elle offense alors la souris qui tente de lui \\u00e9chapper.\\n Alice participe \\u00e0 une course avec les animaux du groupe mais elle les fait fuir en parlant de son f\\u00e9roce chat[N 1].\\n Le lapin blanc r\\u00e9appara\\u00eet alors qu'il cherche les gants et l'\\u00e9ventail de la duchesse et demande \\u00e0 Alice de l'aider. Alice boit dans une petite bouteille et commence \\u00e0 devenir g\\u00e9ante, mais trouve ensuite des petits g\\u00e2teaux pour l'aider \\u00e0 se r\\u00e9duire \\u00e0 sa taille normale.\\n Alice trouve un champignon et une chenille qui fume un narguil\\u00e9. Elle parvient \\u00e0 manger les bonnes quantit\\u00e9s de champignon pour qu'elle puisse retrouver sa taille normale parce qu'elle pense qu'elle a perdu son identit\\u00e9,.\\n La duchesse donne \\u00e0 Alice un b\\u00e9b\\u00e9 qui se transforme en cochon, puis la petite fille rencontre le chat du Cheshire.\\n Alice assiste \\u00e0 un go\\u00fbter avec le Li\\u00e8vre de mars, le Chapelier fou et un Loir tr\\u00e8s fatigu\\u00e9. Ils donnent \\u00e0 Alice de nombreuses \\u00e9nigmes \\u00e0 r\\u00e9soudre, alors Alice dit que c'est le go\\u00fbter le plus stupide auquel elle ait jamais assist\\u00e9.\\n Alice quitte la f\\u00eate et trouve trois cartes peignant les roses blanches, parce que la Reine de c\\u0153ur d\\u00e9teste les roses blanches. Alice rencontre alors le roi et la reine et est invit\\u00e9e \\u00e0 jouer au croquet avec eux.\\n Alice est pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9e au Griffon qui l'emm\\u00e8ne chez la fausse tortue, qui est tr\\u00e8s triste.\\n Alice r\\u00e9cite le quadrille du homard et la danse des fausses tortues et des griffons.\\n Le valet de c\\u0153ur est accus\\u00e9 d'avoir vol\\u00e9 les tartes de la reine.\\n Alice est appel\\u00e9e comme t\\u00e9moin, mais elle est accus\\u00e9e du crime. La reine ordonne \\u00ab\\u00a0de lui couper la t\\u00eate\\u00a0\\u00bb, mais avant qu'Alice ne soit tu\\u00e9e, sa s\\u0153ur la r\\u00e9veille du r\\u00eave.\\n Dans 'The Annotated Alice\\u00a0(en)', Martin Gardner fournit des informations g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rales sur les personnages. Gardner a sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 que le Chapelier est une r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 Theophilus Carter\\u00a0(en), un marchand de meubles connu \\u00e0 Oxford, et que Tenniel a apparemment dessin\\u00e9 le Chapelier pour qu'il ressemble \\u00e0 Carter, sur une suggestion de Carroll.\\n La fausse tortue est une r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence au critique d'art John Ruskin, qui venait une fois par semaine \\u00e0 la maison Liddell pour enseigner aux enfants le dessin, le croquis et la peinture \\u00e0 l'huile.\\n Lewis Carroll r\\u00e9alisa lui-m\\u00eame 37 dessins \\u00e0 la plume dans l'exemplaire manuscrit de l'histoire qu'il offrit \\u00e0 Alice Liddell, le 26 novembre 1864. Une \\u00e9dition en fac simil\\u00e9 (avec une traduction fran\\u00e7aise) a d'ailleurs \\u00e9t\\u00e9 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9e par les \\u00e9ditions Fr\\u00e9mok en 2006.\\n Les sources divergent sur la question de savoir si c'est Dodgson ou son \\u00e9diteur qui jugea bon de ne pas garder ses propres images. C'est en tout cas Lewis Carroll qui opta pour John Tenniel, dessinateur alors r\\u00e9put\\u00e9 pour sa participation \\u00e0 la revue satirique Punch.\\n Bien que les illustrations de John Tenniel restent tr\\u00e8s associ\\u00e9es \\u00e0 l'\\u0153uvre, le texte de Carroll a inspir\\u00e9 un grand nombre d'illustrateurs au fil du temps. Plusieurs centaines de versions ont ainsi vu le jour. Parmi les plus notables\\u00a0:\\n Carroll a \\u00e9crit beaucoup de chansons et po\\u00e8mes pour 'Les Aventures d'Alice au pays des merveilles' notamment\\u00a0:\\n Martin Gardner et d'autres sp\\u00e9cialistes ont montr\\u00e9 que le livre est rempli de nombreuses parodies de la culture populaire victorienne, sugg\\u00e9rant qu'il appartient dans l'esprit \\u00e0 Topsyturveydom de W. S. Gilbert et Alfred Cellier.\\n La plupart des aventures du livre peuvent avoir \\u00e9t\\u00e9 bas\\u00e9es sur ou influenc\\u00e9es par des personnes, des situations et des b\\u00e2timents \\u00e0 Oxford et \\u00e0 Christ Church. Par exemple, le \\\"Rabbit Hole\\\" symbolisait les v\\u00e9ritables escaliers situ\\u00e9s \\u00e0 l'arri\\u00e8re de la salle principale de Christ Church. Une sculpture repr\\u00e9sentant un griffon et un lapin, telle qu'on peut la voir dans la cath\\u00e9drale de Ripon, o\\u00f9 le p\\u00e8re de Carroll \\u00e9tait chanoine, a peut-\\u00eatre inspir\\u00e9 le conte.\\n Dans le huiti\\u00e8me chapitre, trois cartes peignent en rouge les roses d'un rosier, parce qu'elles avaient accidentellement plant\\u00e9 un rosier blanc que la reine de c\\u0153ur d\\u00e9teste. Les roses rouges symbolisaient la maison anglaise des Lancaster, tandis que les roses blanches symbolisaient leur maison rivale des York, et les guerres qui les opposaient \\u00e9taient donc les guerres des Roses.\\n Si le livre est rest\\u00e9 imprim\\u00e9 et inspire continuellement de nouvelles adaptations, le mat\\u00e9riel culturel dont il s'inspire est devenu un savoir largement sp\\u00e9cialis\\u00e9. Le Dr Leon Coward affirme que le livre \\\"souffre\\\" de \\\"lectures qui refl\\u00e8tent la fascination d'aujourd'hui pour le postmodernisme et la psychologie, plut\\u00f4t que de se plonger dans une interpr\\u00e9tation historiquement inform\\u00e9e\\\", et suppose que cela est d\\u00fb en partie au fait que le public d\\u00e9couvre le r\\u00e9cit \\u00e0 travers une source \\\"de seconde main\\\", expliquant que \\\"nos impressions du texte original sont bas\\u00e9es sur une multiplicit\\u00e9 de r\\u00e9interpr\\u00e9tations. Nous ne r\\u00e9alisons pas n\\u00e9cessairement que nous manquons quelque chose dans la compr\\u00e9hension du produit original, parce que nous n'avons g\\u00e9n\\u00e9ralement jamais affaire au produit original\\\".\\n Plusieurs personnes, dont Martin Gardner et Selwyn Goodacre, ont sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 que Dodgson s'int\\u00e9ressait \\u00e0 la langue fran\\u00e7aise, choisissant d'y faire des r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences et des jeux de mots dans l'histoire. Il est plus que probable qu'il s'agisse de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences aux le\\u00e7ons de fran\\u00e7ais - une caract\\u00e9ristique commune de l'\\u00e9ducation d'une fille de la classe moyenne victorienne. Par exemple, dans le deuxi\\u00e8me chapitre, Alice suppose que la souris est peut-\\u00eatre fran\\u00e7aise. Elle choisit donc de lui dire la premi\\u00e8re phrase de son livre de cours de fran\\u00e7ais\\u00a0: \\\"O\\u00f9 est ma chatte\\u00a0?\\\" (\\\"Where is my cat?\\\"). Dans la traduction fran\\u00e7aise d'Henri Bu\\u00e9, Alice suppose que la souris est peut-\\u00eatre italienne et lui parle en italien.\\n L'expression \\\" Digging for apples \\\" de Pat pourrait \\u00eatre un jeu de mots interlinguistique, puisque pomme de terre signifie pomme de terre et pomme signifie pomme.\\n Dans le deuxi\\u00e8me chapitre, Alice s'adresse d'abord \\u00e0 la souris en disant \\\" O Souris \\\", en se basant sur son souvenir des d\\u00e9clinaisons du nom \\\" dans la grammaire latine de son fr\\u00e8re, 'Une souris - d'une souris - \\u00e0 une souris - une souris - O souris\\u00a0!' \\\". Ces mots correspondent aux cinq premiers des six cas du latin, dans un ordre traditionnel \\u00e9tabli par les grammairiens m\\u00e9di\\u00e9vaux\\u00a0: mus (nominatif), muris (g\\u00e9nitif), muri (datif), murem (accusatif), (O) mus (vocatif). Le sixi\\u00e8me cas, mure (ablatif) est absent de la r\\u00e9citation d'Alice. Nilson a plausiblement sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 que l'absence de l'ablatif d'Alice est un jeu de mots sur le travail de son p\\u00e8re Henry Liddell sur le standard A Greek-English Lexicon puisque le grec ancien n'a pas de cas ablatif. De plus, Mousa (signifiant muse) \\u00e9tait un nom mod\\u00e8le standard dans les livres grecs de l'\\u00e9poque dans les paradigmes de la premi\\u00e8re d\\u00e9clinaison, nom court-alpha. En outre, la phrase \\\"O Muse, sing...\\\" ou une variante proche de celle-ci figure dans de nombreuses traductions anglaises d'Hom\\u00e8re, la prononciation par Alice de \\\"O Mouse\\\" formant un jeu de mots qui aurait \\u00e9t\\u00e9 apparent pour les plus instruits parmi le lectorat victorien de Dodgson, \\u00e9tant donn\\u00e9 la relative importance des lettres classiques dans les programmes d'enseignement des classes sup\\u00e9rieures britanniques \\u00e0 cette \\u00e9poque.\\n Comme Carroll \\u00e9tait math\\u00e9maticien \\u00e0 Christ Church, il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 qu'il y a beaucoup de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences et de concepts math\\u00e9matiques dans cette histoire et dans Through the Looking-Glass. La sp\\u00e9cialiste de la litt\\u00e9rature Melanie Bayley a affirm\\u00e9 dans le magazine New Scientist que Dodgson a \\u00e9crit Alice au pays des merveilles dans sa forme finale comme une satire cinglante des nouvelles math\\u00e9matiques modernes qui \\u00e9mergeaient au milieu du XIXe si\\u00e8cle,.\\n Voici quelques exemples de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences aux math\\u00e9matiques dans Alice\\u00a0:\\n Chapitre 1 (\\\" Down the Rabbit-Hole \\\")\\u00a0: alors qu'elle r\\u00e9tr\\u00e9cit, Alice s'interroge avec philosophie sur la taille finale qu'elle atteindra, peut-\\u00eatre \\\" en s'\\u00e9teignant compl\\u00e8tement, comme une bougie \\\"\\u00a0; cette r\\u00e9flexion refl\\u00e8te le concept de limite.\\n Chapitre 2 (\\\"La piscine de larmes\\\")\\u00a0: Alice essaie d'effectuer une multiplication mais obtient des r\\u00e9sultats \\u00e9tranges\\u00a0: \\\"Voyons voir\\u00a0: quatre fois cinq font douze, quatre fois six font treize, et quatre fois sept font... Oh l\\u00e0 l\\u00e0\\u00a0! Je n'arriverai jamais \\u00e0 vingt \\u00e0 ce rythme\\u00a0!\\\" On explore ainsi la repr\\u00e9sentation des nombres \\u00e0 l'aide de diff\\u00e9rentes bases et syst\\u00e8mes num\\u00e9raux positionnels\\u00a0: 4 \\u00d7 5 = 12 en notation de base 18, 4 \\u00d7 6 = 13 en notation de base 21 et 4 \\u00d7 7 = 14 en notation de base 24. En continuant cette s\\u00e9quence, en augmentant de trois bases \\u00e0 chaque fois, le r\\u00e9sultat sera toujours inf\\u00e9rieur \\u00e0 20 dans la notation de la base correspondante. (Apr\\u00e8s 4 \\u00d7 12 = 19 en base 39, le produit serait 4 \\u00d7 13 = 1A en base 42, puis 1B, 1C, 1D, et ainsi de suite).\\n Chapitre 7 (\\\"Un Tea-Party fou\\\")\\u00a0: Le Li\\u00e8vre de mars, le Chapelier et le Loir donnent plusieurs exemples dans lesquels la valeur s\\u00e9mantique d'une phrase A n'est pas la m\\u00eame que celle du contraire de A (par exemple, \\\"On pourrait tout aussi bien dire que \\\"Je vois ce que je mange\\\" est la m\\u00eame chose que \\\"Je mange ce que je vois\\\"\\u00a0!\\\")\\u00a0; en logique et en math\\u00e9matiques, on parle de relation inverse. Alice se demande \\u00e9galement ce que signifie le fait que le changement de si\\u00e8ge autour de la table circulaire les ram\\u00e8ne au d\\u00e9but. Il s'agit d'une observation de l'addition sur l'anneau des nombres entiers modulo N.\\n Le chat du Cheshire s'estompe jusqu'\\u00e0 dispara\\u00eetre compl\\u00e8tement, ne laissant que son large sourire suspendu dans l'air, ce qui am\\u00e8ne Alice \\u00e0 s'\\u00e9merveiller et \\u00e0 noter qu'elle a vu un chat sans sourire, mais jamais un sourire sans chat. L'abstraction profonde des concepts, comme la g\\u00e9om\\u00e9trie non euclidienne, l'alg\\u00e8bre abstraite et les d\\u00e9buts de la logique math\\u00e9matique, s'emparait des math\\u00e9matiques \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9poque o\\u00f9 Dodgson \\u00e9crivait. La d\\u00e9limitation par Dodgson de la relation entre le chat et le grin peut \\u00eatre consid\\u00e9r\\u00e9e comme repr\\u00e9sentant le concept m\\u00eame des math\\u00e9matiques et du nombre. Par exemple, au lieu de consid\\u00e9rer deux ou trois pommes, on peut facilement consid\\u00e9rer le concept de \\\"pomme\\\", dont les concepts de \\\"deux\\\" et \\\"trois\\\" semblent d\\u00e9pendre. Un saut beaucoup plus sophistiqu\\u00e9 consiste \\u00e0 consid\\u00e9rer les concepts de \\\"deux\\\" et \\\"trois\\\" par eux-m\\u00eames, tout comme un sourire, qui semblait \\u00e0 l'origine d\\u00e9pendre du chat, s\\u00e9par\\u00e9 conceptuellement de son objet physique.\\n Carina Garland note comment le monde est \\\"exprim\\u00e9 par des repr\\u00e9sentations de la nourriture et de l'app\\u00e9tit\\\", citant le d\\u00e9sir fr\\u00e9quent d'Alice de consommer (\\u00e0 la fois de la nourriture et des mots), ses \\\"app\\u00e9tits curieux\\\". Souvent, l'id\\u00e9e de manger co\\u00efncide avec des images macabres. Apr\\u00e8s l'\\u00e9nigme \\\"Pourquoi un corbeau ressemble-t-il \\u00e0 un pupitre\\u00a0?\\\", le Chapelier affirme qu'Alice pourrait tout aussi bien dire \\\"Je vois ce que je mange... je mange ce que je vois\\\" et la solution de l'\\u00e9nigme, propos\\u00e9e par Boe Birns, pourrait donc \\u00eatre la suivante\\u00a0: \\\"Un corbeau mange des vers\\u00a0; un pupitre est mang\\u00e9 par des vers\\\"\\u00a0; cette id\\u00e9e de nourriture r\\u00e9sume l'id\\u00e9e de la vie qui se nourrit de la vie elle-m\\u00eame, car le ver est mang\\u00e9 et devient ensuite le mangeur - une image horrible de la mortalit\\u00e9.\\n Nina Auerbach explique que le roman tourne autour du boire et du manger, ce qui \\\"motive une grande partie de son comportement [celui d'Alice]\\\", car l'histoire porte essentiellement sur les choses qui \\\"entrent et sortent de sa bouche\\\". Les animaux du pays des merveilles sont particuli\\u00e8rement int\\u00e9ressants, car la relation d'Alice avec eux change constamment. En effet, comme le dit Lovell-Smith, les changements de taille d'Alice la repositionnent continuellement dans la cha\\u00eene alimentaire, ce qui lui fait prendre conscience de l'attitude \\\"manger ou \\u00eatre mang\\u00e9\\\" qui r\\u00e8gne au pays des merveilles.\\n Article principal\\u00a0: \\u0152uvres bas\\u00e9es sur Alice au pays des merveilles\\n En 2015, Robert Douglas-Fairhurst a \\u00e9crit dans The Guardian,\\n Depuis la premi\\u00e8re publication des Aventures d'Alice au pays des merveilles il y a 150 ans, l'\\u0153uvre de Lewis Carroll a donn\\u00e9 naissance \\u00e0 toute une industrie, des films aux man\\u00e8ges de parcs \\u00e0 th\\u00e8me en passant par des produits tels qu'un costume d'Alice \\\"mignonne et insolente\\\" (\\\"jupon et bas non inclus\\\"). La petite fille au visage vide rendue c\\u00e9l\\u00e8bre par les illustrations originales de John Tenniel est devenue une tache d'encre culturelle que nous pouvons interpr\\u00e9ter comme bon nous semble.\\n Alice et le reste du Pays des Merveilles continuent d'inspirer ou d'influencer de nombreuses autres \\u0153uvres d'art jusqu'\\u00e0 aujourd'hui, parfois indirectement via le film Disney de 1951, par exemple. On trouve des r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences, des hommages, des remaniements et des \\u0153uvres d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9es dans de nombreuses \\u0153uvres de litt\\u00e9rature, de cin\\u00e9ma, de th\\u00e9\\u00e2tre, d'art visuel, de musique et de jeux (comme les cartes \\u00e0 jouer).

Comment ajouter mes sources\\u00a0?\\n \\n Les Quatre Filles du docteur March (titre original\\u00a0: Little Women)  est un roman de l\\u2019autrice am\\u00e9ricaine Louisa May Alcott, publi\\u00e9 dans un premier temps en deux volumes. Le premier parut en 1868 et le second en 1869. \\u00c0 sa sortie, le premier volume connut un franc succ\\u00e8s, autant dans la presse qu'aupr\\u00e8s du public, tant et si bien que l'auteure compl\\u00e9ta son \\u0153uvre par un second volume, sorti en 1869. L'histoire de ces quatre s\\u0153urs a connu d'autant plus de succ\\u00e8s qu'elle a fait \\u00e9cho au quotidien de nombreuses familles am\\u00e9ricaines ayant v\\u00e9cu la guerre de S\\u00e9cession.\\n Ce roman est tir\\u00e9 de l'exp\\u00e9rience personnelle de Louisa May Alcott qui avait trois s\\u0153urs. Par ailleurs, le personnage de Jo semble inspir\\u00e9 de l'auteure elle-m\\u00eame. On peut ainsi consid\\u00e9rer qu'il s'agit d'une autobiographie romanc\\u00e9e.\\n En France, le roman a paru pour la premi\\u00e8re fois en 1880 aux \\u00e9ditions J. Hetzel sous le titre Les Quatre filles du docteur Marsch, traduit et adapt\\u00e9 au go\\u00fbt de l'\\u00e9poque par Pierre-Jules Hetzel sous son nom de plume de P.-J.

En l\\u2019absence de leur p\\u00e8re Robert, pasteur nordiste engag\\u00e9 comme aum\\u00f4nier dans le conflit, quatre jeunes s\\u0153urs issues de la classe moyenne de la soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 font face aux difficult\\u00e9s de la vie quotidienne en ce temps de guerre\\u00a0: la raisonnable Margaret (surnomm\\u00e9e Meg), l'intr\\u00e9pide Josephine (surnomm\\u00e9e Jo), la charitable Elisabeth (surnomm\\u00e9e Beth) et l'orgueilleuse Amy. Elles vivent \\u00e0 Concord dans l'\\u00c9tat du Massachusetts avec leur m\\u00e8re et leur fid\\u00e8le domestique, Hannah. Autrefois riche, la famille March a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 ruin\\u00e9e lorsque Robert March a fait faillite en aidant un ami dans ses affaires.

Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people over cargo. There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. The car is considered an important part of the developed economy.[citation needed]\\n The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor Fran\\u00e7ois Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car\\u2014a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use\\u2014was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, both American cars, are widely considered the first mass-produced and mass-affordable cars, respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages. In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II. In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialised countries.\\n Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than petrol-driven cars before 2025. The transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.\\n There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land-use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and the generation of revenue from taxation. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.\\n The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum \\\"wheeled vehicle\\\" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre \\\"two-wheeled cart\\\", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros \\\"chariot\\\". It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.\\n \\\"Motor car\\\", attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British English. \\\"Autocar\\\", a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning \\\"self-propelled car\\\", is now considered archaic. \\\"Horseless carriage\\\" is attested from 1895.\\n \\\"Automobile\\\", a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek aut\\u00f3s (\\u03b1\\u1f50\\u03c4\\u03cc\\u03c2) \\\"self\\\" and Latin mobilis \\\"movable\\\", entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897. It fell out of favour in Britain and is now used chiefly in North America, where the abbreviated form \\\"auto\\\" commonly appears as an adjective in compound formations like \\\"auto industry\\\" and \\\"auto mechanic\\\".\\n In 1649, Hans Hautsch of Nuremberg built a clockwork-driven carriage. The first steam-powered vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-centimetre-long (26\\u00a0in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger. It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or run.\\n Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle. He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts. His inventions were limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure. In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.\\n The development of external combustion (steam) engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. In the United Kingdom, sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.\\n In 1807, Nic\\u00e9phore Ni\\u00e9pce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyr\\u00e9olophore), but installed it in a boat on the river Saone in France. Coincidentally, in 1807, the Swiss inventor Fran\\u00e7ois Isaac de Rivaz designed his own \\\"de Rivaz internal combustion engine\\\", and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Ni\\u00e9pces' Pyr\\u00e9olophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. Neither design was successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir, who each built vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.\\n In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouv\\u00e9 demonstrated a three-wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity. Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were working on cars at about the same time, the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car\\u2014a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use\\u2014when the German Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen; he is generally acknowledged as the inventor of the car.\\n In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888, Bertha Benz, the wife and business partner of Carl Benz, undertook the first road trip by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband's invention.\\n In 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called boxermotor. During the last years of the 19th century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a joint-stock company. The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world, was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897, the Pr\\u00e4sident automobil.\\n Daimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name Daimler. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895, about 30\\u00a0vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach, and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other's early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35\\u00a0hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\\n In 1890, \\u00c9mile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France. In 1891, Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a petrol-driven vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2,100 kilometres (1,300\\u00a0mi) from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first Paris\\u2013Brest\\u2013Paris bicycle race, but finished six days after the winning cyclist, Charles Terront.\\n The first design for an American car with a petrol internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester, New York. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of 16 years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, Selden was granted a US patent (U.S. patent 549,160) for a two-stroke car engine, which hindered, more than encouraged, development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others, and overturned in 1911.\\n In 1893, the first running, petrol-driven American car was built and road-tested by the Duryea brothers of Springfield, Massachusetts. The first public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon took place on 21 September 1893, on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield. Studebaker, subsidiary of a long-established wagon and coach manufacturer, started to build cars in 1897:\\u200a66\\u200a and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 and petrol vehicles in 1904.\\n In Britain, there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success, with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860. Santler from Malvern is recognised by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first petrol-driven car in the country in 1894, followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895, but these were both one-offs. The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Company, a company founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896, after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines. Lawson's company made its first car in 1897, and they bore the name Daimler.\\n In 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a \\\"New Rational Combustion Engine\\\". In 1897, he built the first diesel engine. Steam-, electric-, and petrol-driven vehicles competed for a few decades, with petrol internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only Mazda's version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success.\\n All in all, it is estimated that over 100,000\\u00a0patents created the modern automobile and motorcycle.\\n Large-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan, and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the US by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world's first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.\\n As a result, Ford's cars came off the line in 15-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower (from 12.5\\u00a0manhours to 1\\u00a0hour 33\\u00a0minutes). It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colours available before 1913, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford's apocryphal remark, \\\"any color as long as it's black\\\". In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.\\n Ford's complex safety procedures\\u2014especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about\\u2014dramatically reduced the rate of injury. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \\\"Fordism\\\" and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the US. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\\n In the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citro\\u00ebn was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.\\n Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910\\u20131911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.\\n Since the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \\\"move up\\\" as their fortunes improved.\\n Reflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared bonnet, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.\\n In Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford's practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss' British subsidiary (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41\\u00a0per cent of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra, had gone under. Citro\\u00ebn did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault's 10CV and Peugeot's 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete. Germany's first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at R\\u00fcsselsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5\\u00a0per cent of the market.\\n In Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companies were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three-wheeled for commercial uses, like Daihatsu, or were the result of partnering with European companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda's decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries, as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation.\\n The transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution, noise pollution and climate change.\\n Most cars in use in the early 2020s run on petrol burnt in an internal combustion engine (ICE). The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers says that, in countries that mandate low sulphur motor spirit, petrol-fuelled cars built to late 2010s standards (such as Euro-6) emit very little local air pollution. Some cities ban older petrol-driven cars and some countries plan to ban sales in future. However, some environmental groups say this phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles must be brought forwards to limit climate change. Production of petrol-fuelled cars peaked in 2017.\\n Other hydrocarbon fossil fuels also burnt by deflagration (rather than detonation) in ICE cars include diesel, autogas, and CNG. Removal of fossil fuel subsidies, concerns about oil dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. This includes hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Out of all cars sold in 2021, nine per cent were electric, and by the end of that year there were more than 16\\u00a0million electric cars on the world's roads. Despite rapid growth, less than two per cent of cars on the world's roads were fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars by the end of 2021. Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use.\\n Oil consumption has increased rapidly in the 20th and 21st centuries because there are more cars; the 1980s oil glut even fuelled the sales of low-economy vehicles in OECD countries. The BRIC countries are adding to this consumption.\\n As of 2023[update] few production cars use wheel hub motors.\\n In almost all hybrid (even mild hybrid) and pure electric cars regenerative braking recovers and returns to a battery some energy which would otherwise be wasted by friction brakes getting hot. Although all cars must have friction brakes (front disc brakes and either disc or drum rear brakes) for emergency stops, regenerative braking improves efficiency, particularly in city driving.\\n Cars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort, and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 21st-century cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation, and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example, the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.\\n Some of the original controls are no longer required. For example, all cars once had controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However, new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. These include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knobs and switches by secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW's iDrive and Ford's MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the early 2020s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.\\n Cars are typically equipped with interior lighting which can be toggled manually or be set to light up automatically with doors open, an entertainment system which originated from car radios, sideways windows which can be lowered or raised electrically (manually on earlier cars), and one or multiple auxiliary power outlets for supplying portable appliances such as mobile phones, portable fridges, power inverters, and electrical air pumps from the on-board electrical system.[a] More costly upper-class and luxury cars are equipped with features earlier such as massage seats and collision avoidance systems.\\n Dedicated automotive fuses and circuit breakers prevent damage from electrical overload.\\n Cars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a boot light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.\\n During the late 20th and early 21st century, cars increased in weight due to batteries, modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and \\\"more-powerful\\u2014if more efficient\\u2014engines\\\" and, as of 2019[update], typically weigh between 1 and 3 tonnes (1.1 and 3.3 short tons; 0.98 and 2.95 long tons). Heavier cars are safer for the driver from a crash perspective, but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users. The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance, with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance. The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, a typical city car, weighs about 700 kilograms (1,500\\u00a0lb). Heavier cars include SUVs and extended-length SUVs like the Suburban. Cars have also become wider.\\n Some places tax heavier cars more: as well as improving pedestrian safety this can encourage manufacturers to use materials such as recycled aluminium instead of steel. It has been suggested that one benefit of subsidising charging infrastructure is that cars can use lighter batteries.\\n Most cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats. Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. Utility vehicles like pickup trucks, combine seating with extra cargo or utility functionality. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, coupe, and minivan.\\n Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Mary Ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown, Ireland, and Henry Bliss one of the US's first pedestrian car casualties in 1899 in New York City. There are now standard tests for safety in new cars, such as the Euro and US NCAP tests, and insurance-industry-backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). However, not all such tests consider the safety of people outside the car, such as drivers of other cars, pedestrians and cyclists.\\n The costs of car usage, which may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance, are weighed against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of the benefits\\u2014perceived and real\\u2014of vehicle usage. The benefits may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience, and emergency power. During the 1920s, cars had another benefit: \\\"[c]ouples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates, plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night.\\\"\\n Similarly the costs to society of car use may include; maintaining roads, land use, air pollution, noise pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life; and can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. Societal benefits may include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of car production and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability of humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.\\n Cars are a major cause of urban air pollution, with all types of cars producing dust from brakes, tyres, and road wear, although these may be limited by vehicle emission standards. While there are different ways to power cars, most rely on petrol or diesel, and they consume almost a quarter of world oil production as of 2019[update]. Both petrol and diesel cars pollute more than electric cars. Cars and vans caused 8% of direct carbon dioxide emissions in 2021. As of 2021[update], due to greenhouse gases emitted during battery production, electric cars must be driven tens of thousands of kilometres before their lifecycle carbon emissions are less than fossil fuel cars; however this varies considerably and is expected to improve in future due to lower carbon electricity, and longer lasting batteries produced in larger factories. Many governments use fiscal policies, such as road tax, to discourage the purchase and use of more polluting cars; and many cities are doing the same with low-emission zones. Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g., hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels.[citation needed] High fuel taxes or cultural change may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars,[citation needed] or to not drive.\\n The lifetime of a car built in the 2020s is expected to be about 16\\u00a0years, or about 2 millionkm (1.2 millionmiles) if driven a lot. According to the International Energy Agency the average rated fuel consumption of new light-duty vehicles fell by only 0.9% between 2017 and 2019, far smaller than the 1.8% annual average reduction between 2010 and 2015. Given slow progress to date, the IEA estimates fuel consumption will have to decrease by 4.3% per year on average from 2019 to 2030. The increase in sales of SUVs is bad for fuel economy. Many cities in Europe have banned older fossil fuel cars and all fossil fuel vehicles will be banned in Amsterdam from 2030. Many Chinese cities limit licensing of fossil fuel cars, and many countries plan to stop selling them between 2025 and 2050.\\n The manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive, and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories, including energy usage, waste and water consumption. Manufacturing each kWh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of petrol. The growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl, therefore encouraging more travel by car, resulting in inactivity and obesity, which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases.\\n Animals and plants are often negatively affected by cars via habitat destruction and pollution. Over the lifetime of the average car, the \\\"loss of habitat potential\\\" may be over 50,000 square metres (540,000\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft) based on primary production correlations.[clarification needed] Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars, referred to as roadkill. More recent road developments are including significant environmental mitigation in their designs, such as green bridges (designed to allow wildlife crossings) and creating wildlife corridors.\\n Growth in the popularity of cars and commuting has led to traffic congestion. Moscow, Istanbul, Bogot\\u00e1, Mexico City and S\\u00e3o Paulo were the world's most congested cities in 2018 according to INRIX, a data analytics company.\\n Mass production of personal motor vehicles in the United States and other developed countries with extensive territories such as Australia, Argentina, and France vastly increased individual and group mobility and greatly increased and expanded economic development in urban, suburban, exurban and rural areas.[citation needed]\\n In the United States, the transport divide and car dependency resulting from domination of car-based transport systems presents barriers to employment in low-income neighbourhoods, with many low-income individuals and families forced to run cars they cannot afford in order to maintain their income. Dependency on automobiles by African Americans may result in exposure to the hazards of driving while black and other types of racial discrimination related to buying, financing and insuring them.\\n Although intensive development of conventional battery electric vehicles is continuing into the 2020s, other car propulsion technologies that are under development include wireless charging, hydrogen cars, and hydrogen/electric hybrids. Research into alternative forms of power includes using ammonia instead of hydrogen in fuel cells.\\n New materials which may replace steel car bodies include aluminium, fiberglass, carbon fiber, biocomposites, and carbon nanotubes. Telematics technology is allowing more and more people to share cars, on a pay-as-you-go basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems. Open-source cars are not widespread.\\n Fully autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, already exist as robotaxis but have a long way to go before they are in general use.\\n Car-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular, in the US and Europe. For example, in the US, some car-sharing services have experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and 2007. Services like car sharing offer residents to \\\"share\\\" a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighbourhoods.\\n The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells the world's motor vehicles, more than three-quarters of which are cars. In 2020, there were 56\\u00a0million cars manufactured worldwide, down from 67\\u00a0million the previous year.\\n The automotive industry in China produces by far the most (20\\u00a0million in 2020), followed by Japan (seven million), then Germany, South Korea and India. The largest market is China, followed by the US.\\n Around the world, there are about a billion cars on the road; they burn over a\\u00a0trillion litres (0.26\\u00d710^12\\u00a0US\\u00a0gal; 0.22\\u00d710^12\\u00a0imp\\u00a0gal) of petrol and diesel fuel yearly, consuming about 50 exajoules (14,000\\u00a0TWh) of energy. The numbers of cars are increasing rapidly in China and India. In the opinion of some, urban transport systems based around the car have proved unsustainable, consuming excessive energy, affecting the health of populations, and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investment. Many of these negative effects fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars. The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems. The car industry is also facing increasing competition from the public transport sector, as some people re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.\\n Established alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transport such as busses, trolleybusses, trains, subways, tramways, light rail, cycling, and walking. Bicycle sharing systems have been established in China and many European cities, including Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programmes have been developed in large US cities. Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted. A study which checked the costs and the benefits of introducing Low Traffic Neighbourhood in London found the benefits overpass the costs approximately by 100 times in the first 20 years and the difference is growing over time.\\n General:\\n \\n Effects:\\n \\n Mitigation:\",\n          \"The Great Gilly Hopkins is a 1978 realistic children's novel by Katherine Paterson.

In 2012 it was ranked number 63 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal \\u2013 the third of three books by Paterson in the top 100.\\n A film adaptation starring Sophie N\\u00e9lisse as Gilly Hopkins and Kathy Bates as Trotter was released in 2015.\\n The novel has been translated into Catalan, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish. \\u00c1rp\\u00e1d G\\u00f6ncz's Hungarian translation has been adapted into a radio play, with Zs\\u00f3fi J\\u00e1vor playing Gilly and M\\u00e1rta F\\u00f3nay playing Trotter.\\n Galadriel \\\"Gilly\\\" Hopkins is a mean, unfriendly 11-year-old girl who is headed for yet another foster home. She hates living with different people all the time and just wants to settle in with her birth mother, Courtney Rutherford Hopkins, whose photograph Gilly secretly treasures. Gilly doesn't like the look of her new foster mom, Mrs. Trotter, a \\\"fat hippo\\\", and decides she is going to hate her whole life.\\n Gilly hatches a plan to escape from Trotter and steals the money she needs for it to work. She knows that her mother lives in San Francisco, California so she writes a letter to Courtney saying that her beloved Galadriel will be with her soon. When Gilly escapes the first time, she gets caught by police and Trotter immediately comes down to the station to retrieve her. Gilly's grandmother, Nonnie, comes to Trotter's house and tells her that she will take Gilly home. Nonnie was previously unaware that she had a granddaughter. By this time Gilly realizes that she really wants to be with Trotter. However, the law says that Gilly must go with Nonnie, so she goes to Nonnie's house.\\n Then Gilly gets good news: her mother is coming. But when she goes to the airport, Courtney is not the woman in Gilly's photograph: she has stringy hair and a lot of other traits Gilly didn't expect, like being selfish. Gilly also finds out that her mother only came because Nonnie paid her, not because she wanted to come. She realizes for the first time how foolish she has been and that she actually loves Trotter. The story ends with Gilly on the phone, crying to Trotter to take her back. Trotter, in turn, gently convinces her that her home is with Nonnie.\\n The Great Gilly Hopkins won various major accolades:\\n The book has been a frequent target of censors; the novel appears on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books between 1990 and 1999 (20), as well as between 2000 and 2009 (52).\\n On February 8, 2013, it was announced that Stephen Herek would direct a film adaptation of the book, with Kathy Bates as Trotter and Danny Glover in major roles.

Each morning, as the golden sun peeked over the horizon, these children would wake to the soothing lullaby of the waves.\\n\\nThe older of the two was Luna, a curious and adventurous girl with hair as silver as moonlight and eyes that sparkled like the brightest stars. Her little brother, Kai, was as playful as a dolphin and had a laugh that sounded like a thousand tinkling seashells. Together, they explored their world filled with ocean treasures and hidden mysteries.\\n\\nOne breezy afternoon, while collecting shimmering sea glass along the sandy shore, Luna and Kai stumbled upon a majestic, old seashell that whispered stories when held close. As they listened, they discovered tales of mermaids who danced under the moonlight, and sea turtles that traveled the world beneath the ocean waves.\\n\\n\\\"Wouldn't it be wonderful to meet them, Kai?\\\" Luna dreamed out loud, her eyes wide with excitement.\\n\\n\\\"Let's follow the whispers!\\\" Kai cheered, as adventurous as ever. And so, hand in hand, they set off on a magical journey across the soft shores and gleaming waves.\\n\\nAs they traveled, they met splendid sea creatures who guided them along the way. A wise old sea turtle named Neptune showed them where the coral gardens bloomed with vibrant colors. A playful pod of dolphins taught them how to ride the waves, filling the air with laughter.\\n\\nFinally, under a sky filled with twinkling stars, Luna and Kai found themselves at a hidden cove. There, they saw mermaids shimmering in the moonlight, their songs creating a beautiful melody that danced with the waves. The mermaids welcomed Luna and Kai, teaching them how to weave dreams from stardust and make wishes upon seashells.\\n\\nThe children learned that when their hearts stayed kind and open, they would always hear the ocean's songs, and it would guide them safely home, no matter how far they wandered.\\n\\nAs the first rays of dawn began to color the sky, Luna and Kai bid farewell to their new friends and promised to share the wonders of the sea with everyone they knew. With hearts full of joy and imagination, they returned home, knowing that the adventure never truly ends when you have the ocean in your heart.\\n\\nAnd every night, as they tucked into bed, the gentle whispers of the old seashell lulled them to sleep, carrying them back to the magic of their ocean friends in dreams. And so, their story flowed, as endless and enchanting as the sea itself.\",\n          \"In a magical kingdom known for its wide-open plains and sparkling rivers, there lived a magnificent wild horse named Spirit. Born under the bright twinkle of a summer sky, Spirit grew from a playful foal into a strong and noble stallion. He galloped proudly, leading his herd through lush meadows and whispering winds.\\n\\nOne evening, while exploring under the soft glow of moonlight, Spirit stumbled upon a group of men with their horses tied nearby, fast asleep. Curious and cautious, Spirit crept closer. But as fate would have it, a twig snapped under Spirit's hoof, waking the men. With a burst of energy, they captured the spirited stallion and took him to a camp surrounded by tall wooden fences.\\n\\nIn this new place, they tried to tame Spirit, but his spirit was strong and free. One day, a young man named Little Creek was also brought to the camp, and he could see that Spirit was no ordinary horse. Little Creek had a kind heart, and he admired Spirit's fierce independence. Together, they devised a clever plan to escape.\\n\\nAs the sun rose brightly, signaling the start of a new day, Little Creek gently whispered his plan to Spirit. With a shared glance of understanding, they made their daring escape, freeing the other horses as they raced toward the open fields.\\n\\nBack at Little Creek's village, Spirit met a beautiful mare named Rain. She was as gentle as the evening breeze and as swift as the river itself. Spirit felt a new kind of freedom in her warm gaze, and they grew close, their hearts dancing in rhythm.\\n\\nBut soon, trouble loomed as men from the camp chased after Spirit and Little Creek. With bravery in their hearts, Spirit and his friends faced many challenges together. In one heroic moment, Spirit leaped across a wide canyon, with Little Creek holding on tightly\\u2014a leap that showed courage can overcome the greatest of fears.\\n\\nThe kind-hearted Little Creek understood Spirit's need for freedom and let him go back to his beloved herd. Rain, now recovered from the dangers they had faced, trotted by Spirit's side. They returned to the golden plains where Spirit's family awaited him.\\n\\nUnderneath the endless sky, Spirit and Rain galloped freely once more, their hooves drumming a joyful tune across the land. And so, in this magical kingdom, Spirit and Rain lived happily, running wild and free under the sunlit heavens. To this day, their story is told with wonder, a tale of bravery, love, and the unbreakable spirit of freedom.\",\n          \"In a tiny village nestled deep within a magical forest, there lived a group of enchanting, little blue creatures called the Smurfs. These cheerful, three-apples-tall beings made their homes in mushroom-shaped houses that dotted the village like colorful candies.\\n\\nEach Smurf had a special name that matched their personality perfectly. There was Brainy Smurf, who loved to share his wisdom; Jokey Smurf, full of giggles and surprises; and gentle Smurfette, with her golden hair and kind heart. No matter what the task, every Smurf knew just what to do, and they all looked up to their wise, old leader, Papa Smurf, who wore a bright red hat.\\n\\nThe Smurfs\\u2019 days were filled with laughter and song, as they gathered smurfberries and played in the sun-dappled forest. But life wasn't always smooth in the Smurf village. Nearby lurked the grumpy old wizard Gargamel and his sneaky cat, Azrael, always dreaming up plans to capture the Smurfs.\\n\\nYet, the Smurfs were clever and worked together to outsmart Gargamel's tricks, teaching us the power of teamwork and friendship. Whenever Gargamel came too close, the Smurfs would scurry into hiding or use their quick wits to turn his plans upside down.\\n\\nAnd so, in the brightest corner of the forest, the Smurfs continued their joyful adventures. Whether building new things, sharing delicious smurfberry pies, or painting the sky with their laughter, the little blue friends cherished every moment together, reminding us all of the magic that true friendship brings.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This giant was unlike any other, for his body glowed softly in the dark, like a big, friendly lantern.\\n\\nThe giant's name was Glimmer, and he loved to roam the forest at night, his glowing body lighting the way for all the creatures who lived there. The fireflies would dance around him, the rabbits would hop alongside him, and the birds would sing sweet melodies to guide him on his way.\\n\\nOne evening, a little girl named Lily wandered into the forest, searching for a special flower to give to her mother. As she wandered deeper into the woods, the trees grew taller, and the path grew darker. But then, she saw a gentle glow in the distance.\\n\\nAs Lily approached the light, she saw Glimmer, the magical giant, standing tall and smiling at her. His glowing body made her feel safe and cozy, and she wasn't afraid at all. Glimmer spoke in a deep, rumbling voice, \\\"Hello, little one. What brings you to our forest tonight?\\\"\\n\\nLily told Glimmer about the special flower she was searching for, and he offered to help her find it. Together, they walked through the forest, Glimmer's glowing body lighting the way. They crossed sparkling streams, climbed over mossy rocks, and followed the sweet scent of blooming flowers.\\n\\nAt last, they came to a beautiful meadow, filled with the most vibrant and colorful flowers Lily had ever seen. And there, in the center of the meadow, grew the most exquisite flower of all \\u2013 a delicate, shimmering bloom that seemed to glow from within.\\n\\nLily gasped with delight, and Glimmer smiled, his glowing body shining brighter with joy. \\\"This is the rare and magical Moonbloom,\\\" he said. \\\"It only blooms once a year, under the light of the full moon. You may pick it, little one, and give it to your mother as a gift.\\\"\\n\\nLily carefully picked the Moonbloom, and Glimmer walked her back to the edge of the forest. As they said their goodbyes, Glimmer's glowing body began to fade, and he whispered, \\\"Remember, little one, the magic of the forest is always here, even when you can't see it. Keep your heart full of wonder, and the world will always be a bright and wondrous\",\n          \"In a magical kingdom, hidden behind a veil of fluffy white clouds, there lived a little boy named Timmy. Timmy loved playing with paper planes, and his favorite thing to do was fold and fly them high up in the sky.\\n\\nOne day, while Timmy was busy folding a new plane, a gentle breeze blew through the kingdom, carrying with it a sprinkle of magical dust. The dust landed on Timmy's paper plane, and to his surprise, it began to glow softly.\\n\\nAs Timmy held the glowing plane in his hands, he felt a strange tingling sensation. Suddenly, the plane started to talk to him in a whispery voice! \\\"Timmy, I have been enchanted,\\\" it said. \\\"I can take you on amazing adventures, but you must promise to use me for good and never for mischief.\\\"\\n\\nTimmy's eyes widened with excitement. He promised the plane that he would use it only for good, and with a happy heart, he gently threw the plane into the air.\\n\\nUp, up, up the plane soared, carrying Timmy on a thrilling journey over rolling hills, sparkling lakes, and even a beautiful rainbow-colored waterfall. As they flew, the plane told Timmy stories about the magical creatures that lived in the kingdom, like the friendly dragons who breathed bubbles instead of fire, and the mischievous fairies who loved to play hide-and-seek.\\n\\nBut as the sun began to set, the plane gently guided Timmy back home. As they landed safely on the ground, the plane whispered, \\\"Remember, Timmy, the magic is not just in me, but in the kindness and joy you share with others.\\\"\\n\\nFrom that day on, Timmy and his enchanted paper plane went on many more adventures together, spreading happiness and making new friends throughout the magical kingdom. And every time Timmy looked up at the sky, he knew that his special plane was always ready to take him on a new journey, as long as he promised to use its magic for good.\",\n          \"Not too long ago, in a land filled with rolling hills and colorful flowers, there was a magical place called Jellybean Hill. It was a special spot where the most delicious and sparkly jellybeans grew in every flavor you could imagine. The jellybeans were so yummy that they made everyone who tasted them smile and feel happy.\\n\\nOn Jellybean Hill, there lived two friendly giants named Grog and Giggle. They were the best of friends and loved nothing more than making people laugh. Grog was a bit taller and had a deep, rumbly voice that sounded like thunder on a sunny day. Giggle, on the other hand, was a bit shorter and had a high-pitched voice that sounded like a happy bird singing in the morning.\\n\\nGrog and Giggle loved to play tricks on each other and make the most wonderful, silly sounds. They would stomp their feet and make the jellybeans jump up and down, creating a colorful, bouncy carpet under their feet. The jellybeans would giggle and shake, releasing their sweet, fruity aroma into the air.\\n\\nOne day, a little girl named Lily wandered onto Jellybean Hill, searching for a special treat to make her mom feel better. She had heard about the magical jellybeans that grew there and wanted to find some to surprise her mom. As she wandered through the hills, she stumbled upon Grog and Giggle, who were busy making the jellybeans laugh.\\n\\nLily couldn't help but giggle at the sight of the two giants playing together. Grog and Giggle heard her laughter and turned around, their faces lighting up with big, friendly smiles. \\\"Hello there, little one!\\\" boomed Grog, while Giggle chimed in with a high-pitched \\\"Welcome to Jellybean Hill!\\\"\\n\\nThe three of them quickly became the best of friends, playing games and laughing together until the sun began to set. Grog and Giggle showed Lily the secret to making the jellybeans giggle, and soon the whole hill was filled with the sweet sound of laughter and happy jellybeans.\\n\\nAs the stars began to twinkle in the sky, Lily knew it was time to go home. Grog and Giggle gave her a big bag of magical jellybeans to take to her mom, and they promised to save some for her next visit. From that day on, Lily visited Grog and Giggle whenever she could, and the three of them filled Jellybean Hill with laughter and joy.\\n\\nAnd so, every time you hear a happy giggle or\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Coproduit par les studios Disney, il est le premier long m\\u00e9trage d'animation en images de synth\\u00e8se des studios Pixar. Le sc\\u00e9nario, \\u00e9labor\\u00e9 par Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen et Alec Sokolow, est bas\\u00e9 sur une histoire originale de John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton et Joe Ranft.\\n Le film met en sc\\u00e8ne un groupe de jouets. Woody, une poup\\u00e9e repr\\u00e9sentant un cow-boy, et Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, une figurine d'astronaute, en sont les personnages principaux.\\n Toy Story a produit pr\\u00e8s de 362\\u00a0millions de dollars de recettes dans le monde. Il a re\\u00e7u des critiques tr\\u00e8s positives qui saluent \\u00e0 la fois l'innovation technique de l'animation et la qualit\\u00e9 du sc\\u00e9nario. Depuis 2005 \\u2014 sa premi\\u00e8re ann\\u00e9e d'\\u00e9ligibilit\\u00e9 \\u2014, il fait partie du National Film Registry.\\n En plus des sorties DVD, de nombreux produits d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9s sont apparus sur le march\\u00e9\\u00a0: jouets, jeux vid\\u00e9o, attractions,\\u00a0etc.\\n Le film a fait l'objet de trois suites au cin\\u00e9ma\\u00a0: Toy Story 2 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 \\u00e0 nouveau par John Lasseter en 1999, Toy Story 3 de Lee Unkrich en 2010[NB 1], et Toy Story 4 de Josh Cooley en 2019.\\n La franchise comprend aussi une s\\u00e9rie t\\u00e9l\\u00e9vis\\u00e9e d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9e, Les Aventures de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair (2000-2001) dont Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, le film\\u00a0: Le D\\u00e9but des aventures, long-m\\u00e9trage directement sorti en vid\\u00e9o en 2000, constitue le prologue. Un film d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9, Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, est sorti en salles en 2022.\\n On peut \\u00e9galement retrouver les personnages de Toy Story dans les Toy Story Toons, qui sont trois courts m\\u00e9trages\\u00a0: Vacances \\u00e0 Hawa\\u00ef (2011), Mini Buzz (2011) et Rex, le roi de la f\\u00eate (2012), mais aussi dans deux moyens m\\u00e9trages\\u00a0: Toy Story\\u00a0: Angoisse au motel (2013) et Toy Story\\u00a0: Hors du temps (2014).\\n Dans la chambre d'Andy, ses jouets se mettent \\u00e0 vivre leur propre vie d\\u00e8s qu'il sort de la pi\\u00e8ce. Le jour de son anniversaire, quelques jours avant le d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement de sa famille, c'est la panique puisque chacun craint d'\\u00eatre remplac\\u00e9 par un jouet neuf. Woody le cow-boy est le jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9 du jeune gar\\u00e7on et n'appr\\u00e9hende donc pas tellement cette f\\u00eate. Mais Andy re\\u00e7oit une figurine articul\\u00e9e d'astronaute, Buzz l'\\u00c9clair (\\u00ab\\u00a0Buzz Lightyear\\u00a0\\u00bb en version originale et qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9coise). Tr\\u00e8s vite, il s'av\\u00e8re que Woody a \\u00ab\\u00a0perdu sa place\\u00a0\\u00bb de jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9, au profit de Buzz. Il essaie toutefois d'accueillir Buzz dans le groupe des jouets d'Andy, mais l'astronaute ne sait pas qu'il est un jouet, mais pense qu'il est un Ranger de l'espace, employ\\u00e9 par Star Command et ennemi du terrible empereur Zurg. Il pense aussi qu'il peut voler, ce que Woody conteste. Apr\\u00e8s une \\u00ab\\u00a0d\\u00e9monstration\\u00a0\\u00bb devant les jouets, ceux-ci l'applaudissent, \\u00e0 l'exception de Woody, qui \\u00ab\\u00a0n'appelle pas \\u00e7a voler\\u00a0\\u00bb mais plut\\u00f4t \\u00ab\\u00a0tomber avec panache\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n Alors qu'Andy se pr\\u00e9pare pour aller \\u00e0 Pizza Plan\\u00e8te (\\u00ab\\u00a0Pizza Planet\\u00a0\\u00bb en version originale et qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9coise), sa m\\u00e8re lui dit qu'il ne peut prendre qu'un seul jouet. Woody essaie alors de se d\\u00e9barrasser de Buzz en le faisant tomber dans un coin inaccessible de la chambre, mais \\u00e9choue et Buzz se retrouve projet\\u00e9 \\u00e0 travers la fen\\u00eatre. Les autres jouets commencent alors \\u00e0 penser que Woody, jaloux, a essay\\u00e9 de tuer Buzz. Quant \\u00e0 Andy, ne trouvant plus Buzz, il s'empare de Woody pour aller \\u00e0 Pizza Planet. Buzz voit soudain Andy aller dans la voiture de sa m\\u00e8re avec Woody et grimpe dans le v\\u00e9hicule pour se venger de ce dernier. Lors d'un arr\\u00eat \\u00e0 une station-service, les deux jouets rivaux se battent, quittent m\\u00eame la voiture de la m\\u00e8re d'Andy, qui repart finalement sans eux.\\n Woody trouve un camion Pizza Planet et pr\\u00e9voit alors de monter dedans pour rejoindre Andy. Mais, redoutant le regard des autres jouets s'il revient seul, il demande \\u00e0 Buzz de venir avec lui. Arriv\\u00e9s \\u00e0 destination, les deux jouets finissent dans une machine attrape-peluche, o\\u00f9 Sid, le voisin d'Andy, connu pour \\u00eatre un destructeur de jouets, les capture.\\n Buzz et Woody essaient d\\u00e9sormais de s'enfuir de la maison de Sid avant le d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement d'Andy. Cette maison renferme de nombreux jouets inqui\\u00e9tants ainsi que Scud, le chien m\\u00e9chant de Sid. Buzz voit alors une publicit\\u00e9 pour la gamme de jouets Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, ce qui le choque profond\\u00e9ment. Il veut se prouver qu'il peut voler, mais n'y arrive pas et se casse un bras. D\\u00e9prim\\u00e9, Buzz se sent incapable de participer au plan d'\\u00e9vasion de Woody. Ce dernier essaie d'obtenir l'aide des jouets d'Andy, situ\\u00e9s dans la maison d'en face\\u00a0; mais ceux-ci lui en veulent toujours d'avoir essay\\u00e9 d'\\u00e9carter Buzz. En revanche, les jouets de Sid viennent en aide \\u00e0 Woody en refixant le bras de Buzz, qui se fait ensuite martyriser par Sid. Woody organise alors, avec les jouets de Sid, un plan de sauvetage de Buzz. Mais m\\u00eame apr\\u00e8s tous ces efforts, les deux jouets ne parviennent pas \\u00e0 rattraper la voiture de la m\\u00e8re d'Andy partie pour le d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement.\\n Ils s'accrochent alors au camion de d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement mais sont poursuivis par Scud. En sauvant Woody du chien, Buzz est \\u00e9ject\\u00e9 du camion. Woody essaie de le sauver avec la voiture t\\u00e9l\\u00e9guid\\u00e9e d'Andy, mais les autres jouets ne lui font pas confiance et il est jet\\u00e9 par-dessus bord. Les jouets comprennent leur erreur lorsqu'ils aper\\u00e7oivent Woody et Buzz sur la voiture t\\u00e9l\\u00e9guid\\u00e9e et les aident alors \\u00e0 les ramener sur le camion\\u00a0; mais les piles de la voiture sont \\u00e9puis\\u00e9es et les deux h\\u00e9ros sont oblig\\u00e9s d'allumer la fus\\u00e9e qu'avait fix\\u00e9e Sid sur le dos de Buzz pour d\\u00e9coller. Finalement, la voiture t\\u00e9l\\u00e9guid\\u00e9e rejoint les autres jouets dans le camion et Buzz et Woody rejoignent Andy dans la voiture. La famille et tous les jouets d'Andy arrivent finalement \\u00e0 bon port dans la nouvelle maison. Chaque jouet est \\u00e0 sa place et chacun s'en trouve heureux.\\n Au No\\u00ebl suivant, la s\\u0153ur d'Andy re\\u00e7oit une Madame Patate tandis qu'Andy re\\u00e7oit un v\\u00e9ritable petit chien, ce qui ne rassure pas la tribu des jouets.\\n \\u00a0Sauf indication contraire ou compl\\u00e9mentaire, les informations mentionn\\u00e9es dans cette section peuvent \\u00eatre confirm\\u00e9es par la base de donn\\u00e9es IMDb.\\n \\u00a0Source et l\\u00e9gende\\u00a0: version qu\\u00e9b\\u00e9coise (VQ) sur Doublage.qc.ca\\n \\u00c0 la fin des ann\\u00e9es 1970, John Lasseter entre aux Studios Disney comme animateur et participe \\u00e0 la production de Rox et Rouky (1981). C'est \\u00e0 cette p\\u00e9riode que remonte sa premi\\u00e8re exp\\u00e9rience dans le domaine de l'animation par ordinateur. Deux de ses amis lui font d\\u00e9couvrir la sc\\u00e8ne du Light Cycle, issue du film Tron (1982)[NB 2]. Cette exp\\u00e9rience est une r\\u00e9v\\u00e9lation qui le sensibilise aux possibilit\\u00e9s offertes par l'animation par ordinateur. Lasseter travaille ensuite pour la division Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Group de Lucasfilm Ltd. qui, vendue par George Lucas \\u00e0 Steve Jobs, deviendra Pixar Animation Studios en 1986.\\n Le court-m\\u00e9trage oscaris\\u00e9 Tin Toy (1988) r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 par Lasseter permet \\u00e0 Pixar d'esp\\u00e9rer pouvoir r\\u00e9aliser son premier long m\\u00e9trage mais, comme le studio r\\u00e9alise une perte nette de 8,3\\u00a0millions de $ en 1990, il doit chercher un partenaire financier. La soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 se s\\u00e9pare le 30 avril 1990 de sa division de mat\\u00e9riel informatique.\\n Au d\\u00e9but des ann\\u00e9es 1990, le studio Disney cherche de nouvelles formes d'animation comme l'animation en volume (L'\\u00c9trange No\\u00ebl de monsieur Jack de Henry Selick, 1993) et \\u00e0 am\\u00e9liorer ses techniques de production avec par exemple le projet informatis\\u00e9 CAPS, collaboration entre les deux soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9s, mais aussi \\u00e0 produire un film en images de synth\\u00e8se. Disney a d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 fait quelques utilisations de l'informatique comme dans La Belle et la B\\u00eate (1991). Ces \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments permettent \\u00e0 Disney et Pixar de se rapprocher. Bien que Lasseter soit un ancien de Disney, il pr\\u00e9f\\u00e8re rester chez Pixar et lancer un projet commun.\\n C'est dans le cadre du projet CAPS qu'au d\\u00e9but de l'\\u00e9t\\u00e9 1990, \\u00e0 l'approche de la fin de la production de Bernard et Bianca au pays des kangourous (1990), l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar apprend l'int\\u00e9r\\u00eat de Disney pour une collaboration.\\n Les premi\\u00e8res discussions commencent entre Ed Catmull, Avy Ray Smith et Peter Schneider, pr\\u00e9sident de Walt Disney Feature Animation. Apr\\u00e8s quelques rencontres entre les membres de Pixar et ceux de Disney, c'est Jeffrey Katzenberg, le pr\\u00e9sident du studio Disney, qui prend en main les n\\u00e9gociations. Pixar propose une \\u00e9mission sp\\u00e9ciale d'une demi-heure nomm\\u00e9e A Tin Toy Christmas, pour gagner en exp\\u00e9rience. Mais Katzenberg refuse cette proposition et autorise l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar, lors de leur r\\u00e9union au sein du studio Disney, \\u00e0 rencontrer les animateurs Disney pour les aider \\u00e0 faire non pas un moyen m\\u00e9trage mais un long m\\u00e9trage. Les discussions se poursuivent et aboutissent en mars 1991 \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9criture d'un contrat pour un long m\\u00e9trage bas\\u00e9 sur les personnages de Tin Toy, appel\\u00e9 Toy Story,.\\n Le 3 mai 1991, les deux parties s'accordent sur les termes du contrat, sign\\u00e9 d\\u00e9but juillet. Le journal The Hollywood Reporter r\\u00e9v\\u00e8le l'information le 12 juillet 1991\\u00a0; le contrat pr\\u00e9voit alors aussi deux autres films, aux noms pour le moment ind\\u00e9termin\\u00e9s, en contrepartie de quoi Pixar percevra 10\\u00a0% des b\\u00e9n\\u00e9fices,. Mais le contrat est beaucoup plus pr\\u00e9cis, il comporte plusieurs clauses dont la possibilit\\u00e9 pour Disney d'arr\\u00eater \\u00e0 tout moment le projet (Pixar recevant 350\\u00a0000\\u00a0USD en compensation) ou de r\\u00e9\\u00e9crire son propre sc\\u00e9nario si celui de Pixar ne leur convient pas, et accorde \\u00e0 Disney la totalit\\u00e9 des droits de toutes les productions d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9es. Une autre concerne les producteurs.\\n Le projet permet \\u00e0 Disney de profiter de l'avance de Pixar dans l'image de synth\\u00e8se, tandis que Pixar utilise l'exp\\u00e9rience de Disney dans la production de longs m\\u00e9trages. Le projet commence chez Pixar avec Edwin Catmull (pr\\u00e9sident), John Lasseter, Ralph Guggenheim (producteur) et Bill Reeves (directeur technique). Leur premi\\u00e8re t\\u00e2che a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 de r\\u00e9aliser un film de 30\\u00a0secondes pour tester la technologie. L'\\u00e9quipe, simplement 10\\u00a0personnes dans l'arri\\u00e8re boutique d'un constructeur de mat\\u00e9riel informatique, s'\\u00e9toffe rapidement avec l'arriv\\u00e9e de Peter Docter et Andrew Stanton.\\n Le concept de base du film est d'imaginer l'empilement des jouets d'une chambre d'enfant prendre vie. Selon Lasseter\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Cette chambre est un microcosme urbain, un melting pot pas si emm\\u00eal\\u00e9\\u00a0\\u00bb. En suivant ce concept, la principale t\\u00e2che de l'\\u00e9quipe de production a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 de retrouver l'essence physique et conceptuelle de chaque jouet, sa (ses) mati\\u00e8re(s), ses textures, ses limitations techniques et en fonction de ces contraintes d'imaginer un caract\\u00e8re, une personnalit\\u00e9. Toutefois c'est d'abord \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9quipe du sc\\u00e9nario de chercher une histoire forte et inoubliable.\\n Un premier sc\\u00e9nario arrive rapidement \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9t\\u00e9 1991, mais Katzenberg le rejette car les personnages voulaient la m\\u00eame chose pour les m\\u00eames raisons. Au d\\u00e9part, le premier jouet devait \\u00eatre Tinny, h\\u00e9ros de Tin Toy, mais ce musicien m\\u00e9canique dans son uniforme rouge \\u00e9tait muet et \\u00ab\\u00a0trop vieillot\\u00a0\\u00bb pour devenir le personnage principal,. Une version interm\\u00e9diaire selon Stanton \\u00e9tait con\\u00e7ue comme la nouvelle de Rip Van Winkle, un jouet se r\\u00e9veille sur le bord d'une route et part \\u00e0 la recherche de ses propri\\u00e9taires, c'\\u00e9tait l'id\\u00e9e retenue pour l'\\u00e9mission A Tin Toy Christmas.\\n \\nIl propose alors \\u00e0 Lasseter de faire un buddy movie et de s'inspirer de films comme 48 heures (1982) et La Cha\\u00eene (1958), des films centr\\u00e9s sur deux personnages qui malgr\\u00e9 leur opposition doivent coop\\u00e9rer, gagnant un respect mutuel.  \\u00ab\\u00a0C\\u2019est un genre que personne n\\u2019avait r\\u00e9ellement explor\\u00e9 dans le domaine de l\\u2019animation. Nous y avons vu un grand potentiel pour r\\u00e9aliser un film avec des personnages forts. L\\u2019id\\u00e9e de base d\\u2019un \\u00ab\\u00a0buddy movie\\u00a0\\u00bb, c\\u2019est de mettre en sc\\u00e8ne deux personnages aux caract\\u00e8res r\\u00e9solument oppos\\u00e9s et de les placer dans une situation qui les oblige \\u00e0 collaborer et \\u00e0 se remettre en cause. Cela permet de traduire \\u00e0 l\\u2019image toutes les \\u00e9tapes de leur \\u00e9volution, et cela offre de grandes possibilit\\u00e9s en termes d\\u2019interpr\\u00e9tation.\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0John Lasseter Une nouvelle version du sc\\u00e9nario, \\u00e9crite par Lasseter, Stanton et Docter, est pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9e en septembre 1991 avec Tinny et une marionnette de ventriloque du genre Charlie McCarthy et ayant appartenu au p\\u00e8re d'Andy. L'id\\u00e9e au centre de l'histoire est la confrontation de deux personnages qui d\\u00e9veloppent petit \\u00e0 petit une amiti\\u00e9,. Cette relation entre un ancien et un nouveau jouet permet d'explorer des territoires complexes en \\u00e9motions. La cr\\u00e9ation des personnages principaux, \\u00e0 savoir l'ancien et le nouveau jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9 d'Andy, n'a pas \\u00e9t\\u00e9 ais\\u00e9e.\\n Tinny est ensuite remplac\\u00e9 par une figurine militaire de type G.I. Joe, jouet pr\\u00e9f\\u00e9r\\u00e9 de Lasseter, avant de se doter d'un th\\u00e8me spatial, d'apr\\u00e8s le jouet des ann\\u00e9es 1960 Major Matt Mason. De plus, la soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Hasbro a refus\\u00e9 l'usage du G.I. Joe, mais a autoris\\u00e9 celui de M.\\u00a0Patate,. Selon le magazine EW, le refus \\u00e9tait motiv\\u00e9 par la mauvaise image donn\\u00e9e par un personnage G.I. Joe attach\\u00e9 \\u00e0 un p\\u00e9tard M-80, m\\u00eame renomm\\u00e9 Combat Carl. Tinny est alors rebaptis\\u00e9 Lunar Larry puis Tempus from Morph.\\n Les personnages devant s'opposer mais partager des traits communs, afin d'avoir un meilleur sc\\u00e9nario autour de l'astronaute, l'ancien jouet est alors devenu un cow-boy, les deux genres cherchant \\u00e0 conqu\\u00e9rir une fronti\\u00e8re. Il est baptis\\u00e9 Woody d'apr\\u00e8s l'acteur afro-am\\u00e9ricain Woody Strode mais reste une marionnette de ventriloque. Les deux personnages Woody et Tempus sont pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9s en juin 1992 \\u00e0 Disney dans un test de 30\\u00a0secondes. Mais comme Disney souhaite que le film vise \\u00e0 la fois un public jeune et un public adulte, la compagnie demande \\u00e0 revoir les personnalit\\u00e9s de Woody et Tempus et que des r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences pour adultes soient ajout\\u00e9es. Un des probl\\u00e8mes de Woody est que les marionnettes de ventriloque ont r\\u00e9cemment \\u00e9t\\u00e9 associ\\u00e9es aux films d'horreur. Lasseter se base alors sur une poup\\u00e9e de Casper le gentil fant\\u00f4me, munie d'une ficelle pour la voix, pour transformer Woody, r\\u00e9duisant en plus sa taille, tr\\u00e8s proche de celle de Tempus et permettant un meilleur antagonisme. Woody a conserv\\u00e9 une trace de la poup\\u00e9e de ventriloque avec sa corde parlante. Le reste de la personnalit\\u00e9 de Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 d\\u00e9velopp\\u00e9 sur l'acteur choisi pour lui pr\\u00eater sa voix (voir ci-apr\\u00e8s). L'ajout de ce personnage spatial, bri\\u00e8vement nomm\\u00e9 Buzz the spaceman, modifie le sc\\u00e9nario. Finalement le personnage spatial est baptis\\u00e9 Buzz Lightyear (Buzz l'\\u00c9clair), en r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 l'astronaute Buzz Aldrin.\\n Dans les premiers sc\\u00e9narios, le lieu de d\\u00e9tente de la famille \\u00e9tait une combinaison entre une pizzeria et un golf miniature, avec des sc\\u00e8nes comiques autour des \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments du golf. Ce n'est qu'avec l'arriv\\u00e9e de Buzz qu'il se transforme en quelque chose qui peut \\u00e9voquer un spatioport, la pizzeria Pizza Planet, m\\u00e9lange de diner des ann\\u00e9es 1950, d'une salle d'arcade des ann\\u00e9es 1990 et d'un fast-food au d\\u00e9cor de science-fiction. Les plans du restaurant et de sa salle de jeu sont si d\\u00e9taill\\u00e9s qu'ils auraient pu \\u00eatre construits pour de vrai, l'\\u00e9quipe charg\\u00e9e de les concevoir ayant travaill\\u00e9 comme des architectes. En octobre 1992, Joe Ranft rejoint Pixar et aide au d\\u00e9veloppement du sc\\u00e9nario.\\n Le nouveau sc\\u00e9nario de Toy Story est fortement influenc\\u00e9 par les id\\u00e9es du sc\\u00e9nariste Robert McKee, et conna\\u00eet de nombreuses modifications avant d'\\u00eatre finalis\\u00e9. Le sc\\u00e9nario initial est l'\\u0153uvre de Lasseter, Schneider, Schumacher, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter et Joe Ranft, ancien de chez Disney. Comme son contrat l'autorise, Disney fait appel \\u00e0 Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow et, plus tard, Whedon, pour aider le d\\u00e9veloppement du sc\\u00e9nario,.\\n Au bout d'une ann\\u00e9e de production, la productrice Bonnie Arnold vient aider Guggenheim, apportant son exp\\u00e9rience des films d'action comme Danse avec les loups (1990). Son arriv\\u00e9e pr\\u00e9vue par le contrat de juillet 1990 \\u00e9tait un souhait de Disney d'avoir deux producteurs, Guggenheim c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 Pixar et Arnold c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 Disney. Le duo a con\\u00e7u un syst\\u00e8me budg\\u00e9taire pour assurer la productivit\\u00e9 du studio Pixar. Du c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 de chez Disney, Kathleen Gavin assure la coordination des projets sp\\u00e9ciaux en tant que vice-pr\\u00e9sidente, ayant d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 coproduit L'\\u00c9trange No\\u00ebl de monsieur Jack.\\n Joss Whedon vient aider \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9criture du sc\\u00e9nario durant quelques mois avant qu'il soit connu comme le cr\\u00e9ateur de la s\\u00e9rie Buffy contre les vampires (d\\u00e9but\\u00e9e en 1997). Whedon avait propos\\u00e9 de faire de Barbie un personnage qui sauverait Woody et Buzz \\u00e0 la fin du film, dans un tenue de commando \\u00e0 l'image de Sarah Connor dans Terminator 2\\u00a0: Le Jugement dernier, \\u00e9l\\u00e9ment qu'il avait d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 imagin\\u00e9 en 1992 pour le film Buffy, tueuse de vampires,. L'id\\u00e9e fut abandonn\\u00e9e apr\\u00e8s le refus de Mattel, propri\\u00e9taire de la licence Barbie. Le producteur Ralph Guggenheim a d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que Mattel n'avait pas accept\\u00e9 l'utilisation de Barbie dans le film car \\u00ab\\u00a0Mattel pense que les filles qui jouent avec des poup\\u00e9es Barbie projettent leurs personnalit\\u00e9s sur la poup\\u00e9e. Si vous donnez \\u00e0 la poup\\u00e9e une voix et que vous l'animez, vous lui donnez une personnalit\\u00e9 qui ne correspond pas \\u00e0 l'id\\u00e9al de chaque petite fille\\u00a0\\u00bb. Les poup\\u00e9es Barbie appara\\u00eetront, cependant, dans les suites du film, Toy Story 2 et Toy Story 3.\\n Disney a donn\\u00e9 officiellement son feu vert pour le film le 19 janvier 1993, date \\u00e0 laquelle le casting des voix a pu commencer,.\\n Lasseter avait toujours voulu que Tom Hanks soit la voix originale de Woody, affirmant que Hanks \\u00ab\\u00a0a la capacit\\u00e9 de prendre des sentiments et de les rendre \\u00e9mouvants\\u00a0\\u00bb,. M\\u00eame si le personnage, comme celui de Une \\u00e9quipe hors du commun (1992) est pauvre et m\\u00e9prisable.\\u00a0\\u00bb De rapides s\\u00e9ances de test, utilisant la voix de Hanks dans Turner et Hooch (1989), ont convaincu ce dernier de signer pour le film,.\\n Billy Crystal a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 approch\\u00e9 pour la voix de Buzz mais a refus\\u00e9 le r\\u00f4le, ce qu'il a ensuite regrett\\u00e9, bien qu'il ait quelques ann\\u00e9es plus tard jou\\u00e9 la voix originale de Bob Razowski dans un autre succ\\u00e8s de Pixar, Monstres et Cie (2001),. Katzenberg propose alors le r\\u00f4le \\u00e0 Tim Allen, d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 apparu dans la s\\u00e9rie t\\u00e9l\\u00e9vis\\u00e9e Papa bricole, et celui-ci accepte apr\\u00e8s une session de test faite \\u00e0 D\\u00e9troit.\\n Toy Story est le premier r\\u00f4le dans un film d'animation \\u00e0 la fois pour Hanks et pour Allen.\\n Lasseter voulait que Don Rickles fasse la voix de M.\\u00a0Patate. Afin de le persuader, Lasseter, Thomas Schumacher et quelques personnes lui ont rendu visite avec une figurine de M.\\u00a0Patate. Par accident, Lasseter a fait tomber le chapeau melon de la figurine qui, sans cet accessoire, avait une forte ressemblance avec Rickles, chauve. Cet incident a permis de d\\u00e9tendre l'atmosph\\u00e8re et finalement Rickles a accept\\u00e9. La recherche de l'acteur pour Zigzag a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 plus longue car l'\\u00e9quipe cherchait un acteur avec un accent ironique. Ne parvenant pas \\u00e0 trouver ce qu'ils voulaient, un jour Schumacher proposa de changer d'optique et d'avoir un accent rural, ce que l'acteur Jim Varney repr\\u00e9sentait assez bien. Ce dernier accepta. Ce choix a par la suite oblig\\u00e9 les \\u00e9quipes artistiques \\u00e0 modifier l\\u00e9g\\u00e8rement Zigzag (voir ci-apr\\u00e8s).\\n Lasseter ne voulait pas faire de Toy Story un film musical comme l'ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 les pr\\u00e9c\\u00e9dentes productions de Disney telles que La Petite Sir\\u00e8ne (1989), Aladdin ou Le Roi lion. Initialement, Disney avait toutefois voulu privil\\u00e9gier le format musical, faisant valoir que \\u00ab\\u00a0Nous suivons la voie des films musicaux. Les personnages qui se mettent \\u00e0 chanter constituent un raccourci important\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n Disney et Pixar sont finalement parvenus \\u00e0 un accord respectant le choix de Lasseter\\u00a0: pas de com\\u00e9die musicale et pas de personnage qui chante, mais des musiques accompagnant et soulignant l'action. Chris Montan, responsable musical chez Disney depuis le milieu des ann\\u00e9es 1980, contacte Randy Newman pour lui demander d'\\u00e9crire les chansons de Toy Story. Ce dernier n'avait alors jamais compos\\u00e9 de musique pour un film d'animation. Lasseter a d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que \\u00ab\\u00a0Ses musiques sont \\u00e9mouvantes, profondes et satiriques, il apportera une touche \\u00e9motionnelle \\u00e0 chaque sc\\u00e8ne\\u00a0\\u00bb. Newman accepte et pr\\u00e9sente sa premi\\u00e8re composition, Je suis ton ami, le 26 mars 1993 \\u00e0 Lasseter, Guggenheim, Arnold et Montan au si\\u00e8ge de Disney \\u00e0 Burbank. Newman a compos\\u00e9 la chanson phare du film Je suis ton ami (ou T'as trouv\\u00e9 un ami au Qu\\u00e9bec et You've Got a Friend in Me en version originale) en un jour. La chanson la plus difficile \\u00e0 composer selon Newman a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 I Will Go Sailing No More (Jamais plus je ne volerai) en raison du changement de sentiment \\u00e0 rendre en plein milieu, passant \\u00ab\\u00a0d'une lamentation plaintive et mordante \\u00e0 un cri de d\\u00e9fi.\\nLa version fran\\u00e7aise quant \\u00e0 elle, est compos\\u00e9e de onze chansons instrumentales, trois versions fran\\u00e7aises interpr\\u00e9t\\u00e9es par Charl\\u00c9lie Couture et d'une chanson dans sa version originale en anglais.\\n Pixar pr\\u00e9sente un avant-projet du film \\u00e0 Disney le 19 novembre 1993,. Le r\\u00e9sultat est d\\u00e9sastreux car Woody est pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9 comme un \\u00ab\\u00a0imb\\u00e9cile sarcastique\\u00a0\\u00bb, un personnage insupportable. Le pr\\u00e9sident de Walt Disney Feature Animation, Peter Schneider, arr\\u00eate imm\\u00e9diatement la production en attendant qu'un nouveau sc\\u00e9nario soit pr\\u00e9par\\u00e9 et approuv\\u00e9 par Disney. Steve Daly mentionne une r\\u00e9union similaire tenue par Joe Ranft en date du 17 novembre 1993 avec le m\\u00eame r\\u00e9sultat. Il pr\\u00e9cise que l'animation avait d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 commenc\\u00e9 et a d\\u00fb \\u00eatre arr\\u00eat\\u00e9e.\\n Dans cette version, Woody trompe les autres jouets et crie sur Zigzag, pousse intentionnellement Buzz, le m\\u00e8ne vers le jardin de Sid. Lasseter demande alors \\u00e0 Disney d'attendre un peu le temps de modifier le sc\\u00e9nario afin d'\\u00e9viter de devoir licencier toute l'\\u00e9quipe de production chez Pixar et que le studio Disney produise le film seul. Pixar parvient \\u00e0 survivre \\u00e0 cet arr\\u00eat en se repliant sur ses anciennes activit\\u00e9s en attendant que le sc\\u00e9nario soit r\\u00e9\\u00e9crit,.\\n Le nouveau sc\\u00e9nario fait de Woody un personnage plus sympathique, gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 la pr\\u00e9sence du sc\\u00e9nariste et v\\u00e9t\\u00e9ran de l'animation Joe Ranft. Par exemple c'est une lampe Luxo (non vivante), en hommage \\u00e0 Luxo Jr., qui fait tomber Buzz et non Woody. Le film est allong\\u00e9 avec une introduction dans laquelle on voit Andy jouer avec Woody pour apporter plus de sentiments. Pour des besoins de r\\u00e9alisme, ou une \\u00ab\\u00a0cr\\u00e9dibilit\\u00e9 \\u00e9motionnelle\\u00a0\\u00bb selon Steve Daly, du film, de nombreux \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments secondaires ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s, le meilleur exemple \\u00e9tant la publicit\\u00e9 pour Buzz l'\\u00c9clair.\\n Katzenberg red\\u00e9marre alors la production en f\\u00e9vrier 1994,. Aucun employ\\u00e9 n'a donc \\u00e9t\\u00e9 licenci\\u00e9. Les acteurs ont d\\u00fb revenir en mars pour enregistrer les textes du nouveau sc\\u00e9nario. Mais Katzenberg refuse que le titre final du film comporte le terme Toy (\\u00ab\\u00a0jouet\\u00a0\\u00bb) par peur de repousser le public adolescent. En raison de d\\u00e9saccords avec Michael Eisner, alors PDG de Disney, Jeffrey Katzenberg quitte Disney et son rempla\\u00e7ant ne s'oppose pas \\u00e0 l'usage du titre Toy Story.\\n Entre le d\\u00e9but de la production et 1994, l'\\u00e9quipe de 24\\u00a0personnes a grossi pour atteindre 110\\u00a0personnes,. En comparaison, Le Roi lion, sorti en 1994, avait un budget de 45\\u00a0millions de dollars et une \\u00e9quipe de 800\\u00a0personnes. David Price d\\u00e9taille ainsi l'\\u00e9quipe\\u00a0: 27\\u00a0animateurs, 22\\u00a0directeurs techniques, 61\\u00a0artistes et ing\\u00e9nieurs. Mais de nombreux artistes \\u00e9taient en r\\u00e9alit\\u00e9 employ\\u00e9s par une soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 commune \\u00e0 Disney et Pixar nomm\\u00e9e Hi Tech Toons.\\n Durant la production, l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar a fait le choix de ne pas reproduire la r\\u00e9alit\\u00e9 en cherchant \\u00e0 en faire une r\\u00e9plique exacte mais de cr\\u00e9er un monde hyperr\\u00e9el. Lasseter a dit \\u00e0 propos du d\\u00e9fi que repr\\u00e9sentait l'animation par ordinateur\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Chaque feuille et chaque brin d'herbe ont d\\u00fb \\u00eatre cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s.\\u00a0\\u00bb Ce principe est compr\\u00e9hensible avec l'exemple des soldats en plastique. Bien qu'ils ne bougent ni comme de vrais soldats ni comme les jouets en plastique qu'un enfant manipule, ils agissent comme des soldats en plastique vivants. Lui et son \\u00e9quipe avaient pour souci majeur de rendre les jouets authentiques et vivants\\u00a0:\\n \\u00ab\\u00a0La qualit\\u00e9 du jeu des personnages de Toy Story parvient \\u00e0 vous faire croire que les jouets sont vivants. Apr\\u00e8s avoir vu le film, vous ne regarderez plus jamais vos jouets ou ceux de vos enfants comme avant. Finalement, Toy Story n\\u2019est peut-\\u00eatre pas une histoire imaginaire...\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0Ralph Guggenheim, producteur du film L'organisation de l'\\u00e9quipe \\u00e9tait comme une cha\\u00eene de montage similaire \\u00e0 celle en vigueur chez Disney.\\n Le d\\u00e9partement artistique con\\u00e7oit les personnages, les d\\u00e9cors et tous les objets. La cr\\u00e9ation du film a commenc\\u00e9 gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 des storyboards anim\\u00e9s qui aidaient les 27\\u00a0animateurs travaillant sur le film \\u00e0 concevoir les personnages. L'animation par ordinateur de chaque personnage est pass\\u00e9e par une premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9tape, o\\u00f9 chaque personnage a soit \\u00e9t\\u00e9 cr\\u00e9\\u00e9 avec de la p\\u00e2te \\u00e0 modeler, soit \\u00e9t\\u00e9 mod\\u00e9lis\\u00e9 sur un sch\\u00e9ma dessin\\u00e9 \\u00e0 l'ordinateur.\\n Le service de la conception graphique dirig\\u00e9 par Ralph Eggleston et comprenant Bob Pauley, Bill Cone, Tia Kratter et Robin Cooper a eu la charge du niveau de d\\u00e9tail des sc\\u00e8nes, de la lumi\\u00e8re d'ambiance g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale au plus petit d\\u00e9tail des accessoires. Des d\\u00e9tails \\u00e0 peine visibles comme les rayures sur plinthes ou un r\\u00e9veil d\\u00e9r\\u00e9gl\\u00e9 et clignotant dans la chambre d'Andy ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 ajout\\u00e9s pour donner l'impression d'un monde r\\u00e9el.\\n Ces \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments sont mod\\u00e9lis\\u00e9s en 3D par l'un des directeurs techniques soit \\u00e0 partir d'un cahier des charges soit d'une sculpture pour les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments plus complexes (certains jouets ou les humains). Les mod\\u00e8les 3D sont agr\\u00e9ment\\u00e9s de contr\\u00f4les, ou variables d'animation, afin de d\\u00e9finir leurs mouvements et les cons\\u00e9quences d'un mouvement sur leur forme. Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 mod\\u00e9lis\\u00e9 par Bill Reeves et Buzz par Eben Ostby. Les cadreurs ont aussi \\u00e9t\\u00e9 charg\\u00e9s de redimensionner les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s par les artistes, parfois de cr\\u00e9er plusieurs versions d'un m\\u00eame mod\\u00e8le comme le bureau d'Andy dont les d\\u00e9tails du bois apparaissent quand Woody monte dessus.\\n Ensuite, le d\\u00e9partement artistique d\\u00e9finit une sc\\u00e8ne avec sa palette de couleurs et son \\u00e9clairage et le d\\u00e9partement du cadrage positionne les mod\\u00e8les dans la sc\\u00e8ne et les mouvements de cam\\u00e9ra. Il n'a fallu pas moins de neuf sources diff\\u00e9rentes de lumi\\u00e8re pour Woody lorsqu'il regarde par la fen\\u00eatre Buzz qui vient de tomber, en raison de l'heure, celle du coucher de soleil.\\n \\u00c0 plusieurs reprises, le film use de miroirs, de reflets et autres surfaces r\\u00e9fl\\u00e9chissantes (casque de Buzz, r\\u00e9troviseur,\\u00a0etc.). Ce rendu a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 obtenu gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 la cr\\u00e9ation d'un environnement mapp\\u00e9 dans un cube. Les images \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments de la sc\\u00e8ne sont projet\\u00e9es sur les faces int\\u00e9rieures d'un cube qui entoure les personnages\\u00a0; le miroir ne fait alors que r\\u00e9fl\\u00e9chir une des faces du cube sans \\u00eatre oblig\\u00e9 de recr\\u00e9er les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments.\\n La sc\\u00e8ne finale, une course poursuite pour rejoindre la voiture de la famille d'Andy, a n\\u00e9cessit\\u00e9 la cr\\u00e9ation d'un d\\u00e9cor tr\\u00e8s important. Pour simplifier leur t\\u00e2che, l'\\u00e9quipe a cr\\u00e9\\u00e9 un jeu de mod\\u00e8les r\\u00e9utilisables constitu\\u00e9 de 14\\u00a0maisons et 15\\u00a0terrains param\\u00e9trables en couleur, implantation et d\\u00e9cors de jardin, pour un total de 125\\u00a0d\\u00e9clinaisons.\\n Le d\\u00e9partement d'animation (3D) applique alors les principes de base de l'animation pour donner vie aux personnages. Une fois que les animateurs avaient le mod\\u00e8le d'un personnage, les articulations et les mouvements ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 cod\\u00e9s, permettant \\u00e0 chaque personnage de se d\\u00e9placer de diverses mani\\u00e8res, de parler, marcher ou sauter. Chaque articulation, avec le code qui lui est associ\\u00e9, est nomm\\u00e9e avar\\u00a0(en) (animation variable),. Une fois le personnage et ses avars cr\\u00e9\\u00e9s, les animateurs avaient souvent la charge de chercher \\u00e0 \\u00ab\\u00a0briser\\u00a0\\u00bb le personnage, pousser les avars \\u00e0 l'extr\\u00eame pour d\\u00e9tecter les \\u00e9ventuels bugs.\\n Chez Pixar, \\u00e0 l'inverse des habitudes[NB 3] de Disney, un animateur g\\u00e8re une sc\\u00e8ne en entier et non un personnage durant tout le film\\u00a0; toutefois, il y a quelques exceptions. Pour la sc\\u00e8ne dans la station service, Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 anim\\u00e9 par Mark Oftedal et Buzz par Guionne Leroy. L'animateur d\\u00e9finit des points cl\\u00e9s de l'animation, la machine g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rant les \\u00e9tapes interm\\u00e9diaires.\\n De tous les personnages, Woody a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 le plus complexe puisqu'il a n\\u00e9cessit\\u00e9 la cr\\u00e9ation de 723\\u00a0mouvements possibles, dont 212 pour le visage et 58 pour la bouche,.\\n Lasseter a fait le choix de ne pas faire g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rer les mouvements des l\\u00e8vres. Pour synchroniser la voix des acteurs avec les personnages, les animateurs ont pass\\u00e9 une semaine par trame de 8\\u00a0secondes \\u00e0 repasser en d\\u00e9tail sur la bouche des personnages et sur leurs expressions.\\n Apr\\u00e8s cela, les animateurs ont compil\\u00e9 les sc\\u00e8nes et d\\u00e9velopp\\u00e9 un nouveau storyboard avec les personnages anim\\u00e9s par ordinateur. Les animateurs ont ensuite ajout\\u00e9 des ombres, de l'\\u00e9clairage, des effets visuels, et enfin \\u2014 gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 300\\u00a0processeurs informatiques \\u2014 ont donn\\u00e9 au film son apparence finale,. L'\\u00e9quipe responsable des textures, dirig\\u00e9e par Tom Porter, a utilis\\u00e9 l'outil de texturage de RenderMan, le RenderMan Shading Language. L'\\u00e9quipe responsable des \\u00e9clairages, la plus importante en nombre et dirig\\u00e9e par Galyn Susman et Sharon Calahan, a eu \\u00e0 sa disposition de nombreuses possibilit\\u00e9s techniques allant des \\u00e9clairages standards (vie courante), professionnels (cin\\u00e9ma) mais aussi des lumi\\u00e8res sans ombres, d'autres n'\\u00e9clairant qu'un seul objet ou encore des projecteurs d'ombres.\\n Afin de r\\u00e9aliser le rendu de Toy Story, Pixar a utilis\\u00e9 une ferme de serveurs, la Renderfarm. Le film a utilis\\u00e9 un affichage \\u00e0 la r\\u00e9solution de 1\\u00a0536 \\u00d7 922 pixels avec un pixel repr\\u00e9sentant un carr\\u00e9 d'un demi-centim\\u00e8tre pour un \\u00e9cran de salle de cin\\u00e9ma standard. Gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 l'utilisation de l'anticr\\u00e9nelage pour adoucir les traits, une r\\u00e9solution plus grande, estim\\u00e9e \\u00e0 plusieurs milliers de lignes, n'a pas \\u00e9t\\u00e9 n\\u00e9cessaire.\\n Au cours de la post-production, le film a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 envoy\\u00e9 \\u00e0 Skywalker Sound, o\\u00f9 les effets sonores ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 m\\u00e9lang\\u00e9s avec le th\\u00e8me musical. Une s\\u00e9ance de test en public a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9e \\u00e0 San Rafael en 1993.\\n L'apparence de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair est bas\\u00e9e sur les combinaisons port\\u00e9es par les astronautes du programme Apollo et les figurines G.I. Joe,. Sa mentalit\\u00e9 rigide et son inflexibilit\\u00e9, mais aussi sa force de caract\\u00e8re sont dus \\u00e0 la mati\\u00e8re qui le compose, du plastique rigide.\\n Le deuxi\\u00e8me personnage, initialement une poup\\u00e9e de ventriloque, a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 chang\\u00e9 en une poup\\u00e9e cow-boy, le sh\\u00e9rif Woody, nomm\\u00e9e d'apr\\u00e8s l'acteur am\\u00e9ricain de westerns Woody Strode. En apparence, Woody est tr\\u00e8s relax\\u00e9, d\\u00e9tendu, avec un aspect attachant et des valeurs qui nous poussent \\u00e0 avoir confiance en lui. Au contraire de Buzz, Woody n'a pas un moral d'acier\\u00a0; quand son mental flanche, son corps fait de m\\u00eame, c'est \\u00e0 relier au fait que c'est une poup\\u00e9e en tissu.\\n Plus de deux mille croquis de Woody et mille de Buzz ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 n\\u00e9cessaires avant d'aboutir aux personnages que l'on conna\\u00eet, choisis par John Lasseter. Graphiquement, les deux personnages ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 con\\u00e7us avant que Tim Allen et Tom Hanks ne donnent leurs voix\\u00a0; mais selon Bonnie Arnold, plus ils pr\\u00eataient leur voix, plus Buzz et Woody donnaient l'impression d'\\u00eatre Allen et Hanks. Finalement, Woody comprend plus de 1\\u00a0500 avars, bien plus que les 18 de Luxo Jr.\\n Le caract\\u00e8re m\\u00e9content de M.\\u00a0Patate est, comme l'explique Lasseter, d\\u00fb \\u00e0 son int\\u00e9grit\\u00e9 physique, les \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments de son visage tombant \\u00e0 longueur de journ\\u00e9e, motif l\\u00e9gitime de m\\u00e9contentement. Ceci fait en plus un parall\\u00e8le avec l'expression am\\u00e9ricaine \\u00ab\\u00a0a chip on his shoulder\\u00a0\\u00bb qui d\\u00e9signe un m\\u00e9contentement, une rumination pour la personne qui doit porter \\u00ab\\u00a0une \\u00e9charde (chip) sur son \\u00e9paule\\u00a0\\u00bb, \\u00e9tant donn\\u00e9 que chip signifie \\u00e9galement \\u00ab\\u00a0tranche\\u00a0\\u00bb et que c'est de l\\u00e0 que vient le mot \\u00ab\\u00a0chips\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n La fragilit\\u00e9 de la poup\\u00e9e de porcelaine La Berg\\u00e8re induit la douce romance avec Woody et ses mouvements d\\u00e9licats, sinon elle casse. Pour Bayonne, comme on place souvent une tirelire en hauteur sur une \\u00e9tag\\u00e8re, il \\u00e9prouve un sentiment de sup\\u00e9riorit\\u00e9 et, en liaison avec l'expression \\u00ab\\u00a0two cents matters\\u00a0\\u00bb, pense avoir souvent raison. Techniquement les deux personnages sont identiques au niveau informatique, un assemblage de formes simples \\u00e0 la surface lisse mais gr\\u00e2ce au logiciel d'ombrage, qui g\\u00e8re la fa\\u00e7on dont une source lumineuse arrive sur une surface, la texture, la \\u00ab\\u00a0peau\\u00a0\\u00bb de Bayonne et celle de la Berg\\u00e8re sont totalement diff\\u00e9rentes.\\n Pour Rex, ses articulations peu nombreuses et limit\\u00e9es l'\\u00e9loignent des monstres de Jurassic Park (1993) ce qui le rend rigide mais aussi provoque son manque de confiance en lui. Sa pr\\u00e9sence dans le film \\u00e9tait justifi\\u00e9e par la forte popularit\\u00e9 des dinosaures et du Tyrannosaurus rex. Afin de renforcer le fait que ce soit un jouet, la texture de sa peau au niveau du cou se brise quand il tourne la t\\u00eate, qui comme c'est un jouet bouge d'un seul bloc. Zigzag, en raison de sa difficult\\u00e9 \\u00e0 se mouvoir par lui-m\\u00eame, a un caract\\u00e8re de suiveur. \\u00c0 l'origine con\\u00e7u comme un chien Jack Russell Terrier, joueur et nerveux, son aspect a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 modifi\\u00e9 avec le choix de l'acteur Jim Varney, ses oreilles ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 allong\\u00e9es, assouplies et d\\u00e9plac\\u00e9es du haut du cr\\u00e2ne vers le c\\u00f4t\\u00e9, ses yeux ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 mis en berne, son cou rapetiss\\u00e9 et il est devenu plus proche du chien de Saint-Hubert, comme Pluto.\\n Le colosse miniature avec des bras disproportionn\\u00e9s est appel\\u00e9 Rocky Gibraltar, c'est une figurine de catch. Pour animer les soldats en plastique, Pete Docter a demand\\u00e9 \\u00e0 une partie des artistes d'attacher chacun des vieilles chaussures \\u00e0 une planche et de marcher avec. Apr\\u00e8s plusieurs s\\u00e9ries de pas et sauts dans le hall du studio, les animateurs ont r\\u00e9ussi \\u00e0 imaginer les mouvements des soldats. De m\\u00eame, de nombreuses tentatives ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9es pour comprendre l'ouverture du parachute et les mouvements lors d'une descente du second \\u00e9tage d'un soldat parachutiste miniature suspendu par le casque.\\n Pour repr\\u00e9senter les humains, le d\\u00e9fi de l'\\u00e9quipe de Pixar a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 comparable \\u00e0 celui pour Blanche-Neige et les Sept Nains (1937) car personne n'avait encore r\\u00e9ussi \\u00e0 reproduire un humain convaincant, or il fallait ici en cr\\u00e9er quatre. Le premier personnage humain le plus approchant de ce que les animateurs voulaient \\u00e9tait le b\\u00e9b\\u00e9 dans Tin Toy. La difficult\\u00e9 provient surtout de la conjonction de la peau et des v\\u00eatements\\u00a0; ainsi, pour reproduire les mouvements du visage et du T-shirt de Sid, garde-robe qui ne d\\u00e9passe pas un total de 50\\u00a0$ (dans la vie r\\u00e9elle), il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 n\\u00e9cessaire \\u00ab\\u00a0d'afficher plus de lignes qu'un \\u00e9cran de contr\\u00f4le a\\u00e9rien\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n Le chien de Sid, Scud, est anim\\u00e9 gr\\u00e2ce \\u00e0 178 avars mais certains comme ceux des oreilles et de la queue ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 tr\\u00e8s souvent utilis\\u00e9s, au contraire de ceux des dents. Les jouets mutants, \\u00ab\\u00a0r\\u00e9par\\u00e9s\\u00a0\\u00bb par Sid, sont parmi les derniers \\u00e0 avoir \\u00e9t\\u00e9 con\\u00e7us et model\\u00e9s. Et pour beaucoup ils r\\u00e9utilisent des \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments con\\u00e7us pour les jouets d'Andy comme le torse de Rocky Gibraltar pour le mutant \\u00e0 t\\u00eate d'insecte ou le skateboard d'Andy en version miniature pour RollerBob.\\n Le budget initial fourni par Disney \\u00e9tait de 17,5\\u00a0millions d'USD avec une sortie pr\\u00e9vue pour 1994. Mais d\\u00e8s 1994, le budget de Disney atteint les 21,5\\u00a0millions, et 6\\u00a0millions sont encore n\\u00e9cessaires. De son c\\u00f4t\\u00e9, Steve Jobs, qui avait achet\\u00e9 Pixar pour 10\\u00a0millions d'USD, a investi plus de 50\\u00a0millions sans atteindre la rentabilit\\u00e9. Disney demande \\u00e0 Pixar de faire un cr\\u00e9dit de 3\\u00a0millions d'USD garanti sur les fonds personnels de Jobs. Steve Jobs tente de renflouer Pixar en faisant un partenariat avec Microsoft.\\n Finalement la cr\\u00e9ation du film a n\\u00e9cessit\\u00e9 un budget de 30\\u00a0millions de dollars. Avant la sortie du film, le producteur ex\\u00e9cutif du film Steve Jobs avait d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que \\u00ab\\u00a0Si Toy Story remporte un succ\\u00e8s mod\\u00e9r\\u00e9 \\u2014 disons 75\\u00a0millions de $ au box-office \\u2014 on [Pixar et Disney] atteindra le seuil de rentabilit\\u00e9. S'il en recueille 100\\u00a0millions, on gagnera de l'argent. Mais si c'est un vrai blockbuster et qu'il rapporte 200\\u00a0millions ou \\u00e0 peu pr\\u00e8s, on va se faire beaucoup d'argent.\\u00a0\\u00bb Le pr\\u00e9sident de Disney Michael Eisner avait lui d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que \\u00ab\\u00a0La technologie est brillante, les voix sont inspir\\u00e9es et je pense que l'histoire va toucher la corde sensible des gens. Croyez-moi, lorsqu'on a pour la premi\\u00e8re fois accept\\u00e9 de travailler ensemble, on ne pensait vraiment pas que leur premier film serait notre sortie de l'\\u00e9t\\u00e9 1995\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n En d\\u00e9cembre 1994, Guggenheim rencontre un directeur de Disney Consumer Products (DCP) et d\\u00e9couvre l'absence d'une gamme de produits d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9s. Cette absence \\u00e9tait due \\u00e0 un calendrier charg\\u00e9 en productions chez Disney, avec Pocahontas (1995) et Le Bossu de Notre-Dame (1996) ainsi qu'\\u00e0 une incompr\\u00e9hension, d'apr\\u00e8s laquelle Toy Story n'aurait pas de personnages originaux.\\n En janvier 1995, Peter Schneider annonce la sortie de Toy Story pour novembre 1995 ne laissant que la moiti\\u00e9 du temps habituel pour concevoir une gamme. De plus, Mattel et Hasbro d\\u00e9clinent l'offre de produire des jouets. Disney trouve un fabricant qui accepte de produire les jouets, Toy Fair, une soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 de Toronto avec une succursale en Chine nomm\\u00e9e Thinkway Toys, sp\\u00e9cialis\\u00e9e dans les tirelires parlantes. C'est aussi en janvier que Lasseter rencontre Albert Chan, propri\\u00e9taire de Thinkway et principal cr\\u00e9ateur. Chan propose une gamme de jouets bas\\u00e9e sur des figurines de 6\\u00a0pouces (15,2\\u00a0cm), moiti\\u00e9 moins que le format des G.I. Joe souhait\\u00e9 par Lasseter pour Buzz. Chan r\\u00e9pond que ce format ne se fait plus mais Lasseter insiste arguant que le public voudra les personnages du film. D\\u00e9but mars, Chan revient avec des figurines, 12\\u00a0pouces (30,5\\u00a0cm) pour Buzz et 15\\u00a0pouces (38,1\\u00a0cm) pour Woody et Lasseter l'emm\\u00e8ne dans une salle de projection du studio o\\u00f9 le film \\u00e9tait projet\\u00e9. Selon les souvenirs de Lasseter, les employ\\u00e9s du studio sont alors devenus hyst\\u00e9riques. Eben Osby, modeleur de Buzz, a bondi de son si\\u00e8ge, travers\\u00e9 la salle en courant pour prendre la figurine des mains de Lasseter. Mais les cha\\u00eenes de magasins n'ont pas partag\\u00e9 l'enthousiasme des employ\\u00e9s\\u00a0: Walmart ne commercialisa pas la figurine, Toys \\\"R\\\" Us et Disney Store n'ont eux command\\u00e9 pour les \\u00c9tats-Unis que 60\\u00a0000\\u00a0figurines de Buzz et 45\\u00a0000 de Woody. Lasseter demanda la cr\\u00e9ation de 250\\u00a0000\\u00a0figurines de chaque, mena\\u00e7ant de les produire \\u00e0 ses frais. Une semaine avant la sortie du film, ce stock \\u00e9tait d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 \\u00e9coul\\u00e9. Les commandes de figurines de Buzz ont atteint les 1,6\\u00a0million apr\\u00e8s une semaine de diffusion. En 2007, on comptait 25\\u00a0millions de figurines vendues, tous personnages confondus.\\n Toy Story a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 au centre d'une grande campagne de marketing avant sa sortie qui mettait en avant des images du film, par exemple sur les emballages alimentaires. Une grande diversit\\u00e9 de produits d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9s est sortie durant l'exploitation en salles du film et durant sa sortie en VHS dont des jouets, des v\\u00eatements ou des chaussures.\\n Disney a d\\u00e9pens\\u00e9 20\\u00a0millions de dollars pour le marketing autour du film\\u00a0; Burger King, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola et Payless ShoeSource ont eux d\\u00e9pens\\u00e9 125\\u00a0millions de dollars dans des op\\u00e9rations mettant en jeu la promotion autour du film,. The New York Times d\\u00e9taille quelques-unes des d\\u00e9penses\\u00a0: 45\\u00a0millions de dollars pour Burger King, 75\\u00a0\\u00e0 80\\u00a0millions de sachets promotionnels chez Frito-Lay, filiale de PepsiCo, tandis que Coca-Cola a propos\\u00e9 des promotions sur la gamme Minute Maid (alors en perte de vitesse).\\n Un consultant marketing a dit \\u00e0 propos de cette promotion\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Comment un enfant, assis devant un film d'une heure et demie mettant en sc\\u00e8ne une foule de jouets reconnaissables \\u00e0 l'\\u0153il, pourra ne pas vouloir en poss\\u00e9der un\\u00a0?\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n \\n AllMusic\\u00a0: \\n modifier  Classements\\u00a0:\\n La premi\\u00e8re de Toy Story a eu lieu le 19 novembre 1995 \\u00e0 Hollywood, en Californie dans le El Capitan Theatre.

Cependant, depuis l'acquisition compl\\u00e8te de Pixar par The Walt Disney Company en 2006, Toy Story \\u2014 tout comme les autres films produits par Pixar \\u2014 fait d\\u00e9sormais figurer la marque Disney\\u2022Pixar.\\n Toy Story a re\\u00e7u un accueil critique tr\\u00e8s favorable par les critiques du monde entier.

Kenneth Turan du Los Angeles Times a d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 que \\u00ab\\u00a0Avec Tom Hanks, qui apporte [\\u2026] une \\u00e9norme cr\\u00e9dibilit\\u00e9 \\u00e0 Woody, Toy Story constitue l'un des films d'animation les mieux interpr\\u00e9t\\u00e9s\\u00a0; les acteurs font fortement ressentir leur pr\\u00e9sence\\u00a0\\u00bb. Plusieurs critiques ont \\u00e9galement f\\u00e9licit\\u00e9 la capacit\\u00e9 du film \\u00e0 r\\u00e9unir des personnes de tous \\u00e2ges, et en particulier aussi bien les enfants que les adultes,. Owen Gleiberman du magazine Entertainment Weekly a \\u00e9crit\\u00a0:\\u00ab\\u00a0Il a la puret\\u00e9, la libert\\u00e9 extatique de l'imagination, c'est la marque des meilleurs films pour enfants\\u00a0\\u00bb.\\n \\u00ab\\u00a0Oui, nous nous pr\\u00e9occupons de ce que disent les critiques. Oui, nous nous pr\\u00e9occupons des chiffres que notre film va faire au box-office la premi\\u00e8re semaine. Oui, nous nous pr\\u00e9occupons des chiffres que notre film va faire au box-office en totalit\\u00e9. Mais si nous faisons tout ce que nous faisons, c'est avant tout pour divertir notre public. Je tire la plus grande joie de mon m\\u00e9tier de r\\u00e9alisateur lorsque je me glisse dans une salle de cin\\u00e9ma anonymement et que je regarde les gens qui regardent mon film. Voir la joie sur le visage des gens, voir les gens \\u00eatre vraiment dans le film... est pour moi la plus grande r\\u00e9compense que je pourrais avoir.\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0John Lasseter En 1995, le magazine Time a class\\u00e9 Toy Story \\u00e0 la huiti\\u00e8me place des dix meilleurs films de l'ann\\u00e9e. En 2003, The Online Film Critics Society a d\\u00e9sign\\u00e9 le film comme le meilleur film d'animation de tous les temps. En 2007 cette fois-ci, Toy Story est apparu \\u00e0 la 22e\\u00a0place du top 50 des films aux effets visuels les plus influents, dress\\u00e9 par The Visual Effects Society. En 2005 \\u2014 sa premi\\u00e8re ann\\u00e9e d'\\u00e9ligibilit\\u00e9 \\u2014 le film est entr\\u00e9 au National Film Registry. Il est donc l'un des cinq seuls films qui y sont entr\\u00e9s lors de leur premi\\u00e8re ann\\u00e9e d'\\u00e9ligibilit\\u00e9, avec Do the Right Thing, Raging Bull, Les Affranchis et Fargo. Il est aussi class\\u00e9 99e sur le classement des 100\\u00a0meilleurs films am\\u00e9ricains de tous les temps r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 par l'AFI en 2007,,. Il est l'un des deux seuls films d'animation sur cette liste, avec Blanche-Neige et les Sept Nains. Toy Story est \\u00e9galement apparu \\u00e0 la sixi\\u00e8me place d'un autre classement de l'AFI, celui des dix meilleurs films d'animation.\\n Enfin, le film a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 d\\u00e9clar\\u00e9 \\u00ab\\u00a0meilleur film d'animation\\u00a0\\u00bb \\u00e0 la fois par la Los Angeles Film Critics Association et le Kansas City Film Critics Circle,. Ce film fait partie de la liste du BFI des 50 films \\u00e0 voir avant d'avoir 14 ans \\u00e9tablie en 2005 par le British Film Institute, int\\u00e9grant m\\u00eame le top 10 de cette liste. Il est aussi le plus haut class\\u00e9 des films d'animation (99e) dans le classement du magazine Empire des 500\\u00a0meilleurs films de tous les temps.\\n Durant les cinq premiers jours d'exploitation du film aux \\u00c9tats-Unis (correspondant au week-end de Thanksgiving \\u2014 l'Action de gr\\u00e2ce), les recettes se sont \\u00e9lev\\u00e9es \\u00e0 39\\u00a0071\\u00a0176\\u00a0$US. Toy Story s'est class\\u00e9 premier au box-office du week-end avec des recettes de 29\\u00a0140\\u00a0617\\u00a0$, position qu'il a maintenue les deux semaines suivantes. David Price donne les chiffres suivants\\u00a0: 10\\u00a0millions le premier jour, 28\\u00a0millions pour les trois jours du week-end, 64,7\\u00a0millions au bout de 12\\u00a0jours.\\n Le film a eu les recettes aux \\u00c9tats-Unis les plus hautes de tous les films sortis en 1995, dont Batman Forever et Apollo 13 (avec Tom Hanks \\u00e9galement). \\u00c0 l'\\u00e9poque de sa sortie, il constituait le troisi\\u00e8me meilleur film d'animation en termes de recettes, apr\\u00e8s Le Roi lion (1994) et Aladdin (1992). Sans tenir compte de l'inflation, Toy Story \\u00e9tait class\\u00e9 en mars 2009 \\u00e0 la 96e\\u00a0place sur la liste des films ayant fait les meilleures recettes aux \\u00c9tats-Unis, depuis il est descendu en juillet 2010 \\u00e0 la 115e. Le film a eu des revenus bruts de 191\\u00a0796\\u00a0233\\u00a0$ aux \\u00c9tats-Unis et au Canada et de 170\\u00a0162\\u00a0503\\u00a0$ \\u00e0 l'international, pour un total de 361\\u00a0958\\u00a0736\\u00a0$. En France, Toy Story a totalis\\u00e9 2\\u00a0746\\u00a0426\\u00a0entr\\u00e9es, faisant de lui le huiti\\u00e8me plus grand succ\\u00e8s en France de l'ann\\u00e9e 1996.\\n Le tableau suivant dresse un bilan du nombre d'entr\\u00e9es qu'avait effectu\\u00e9 le film dans diff\\u00e9rents pays d'Europe au 1er janvier 1997.\\n Toy Story est sorti en VHS et Laserdisc le 29 octobre 1996, sans bonus. Durant la premi\\u00e8re semaine apr\\u00e8s sa sortie, les recettes des locations de VHS s'\\u00e9levaient \\u00e0 5,1\\u00a0millions de dollars, faisant de Toy Story le num\\u00e9ro un des vid\\u00e9os de la semaine. Plus de 21,5\\u00a0millions de VHS ont \\u00e9t\\u00e9 vendues la premi\\u00e8re ann\\u00e9e,. Le 11 janvier 2000, il est sorti en VHS dans la s\\u00e9rie Gold Classic Collection, avec Tin Toy en bonus\\u00a0; ces cassettes se sont \\u00e9coul\\u00e9es \\u00e0 2\\u00a0millions d'unit\\u00e9s. Sa premi\\u00e8re sortie en DVD remonte au 17 octobre 2000, o\\u00f9 il \\u00e9tait inclus dans un pack avec Toy Story 2 (avant d'\\u00eatre plus tard disponible individuellement). \\u00c9galement le 17 octobre 2000, un ensemble de trois DVD est sorti, l\\u2019Ultimate Toy Box, compos\\u00e9 de Toy Story, Toy Story 2 et un DVD de bonus. Le 6 septembre 2005, un double-DVD en l'honneur du dixi\\u00e8me anniversaire de la s\\u00e9rie est sorti, contenant une grande partie des bonus de l\\u2019Ultimate Toy Box.\\n Toy Story a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 disponible en format Blu-ray pour la premi\\u00e8re fois dans le Special Edition Combo Pack qui contenait deux disques\\u00a0: le film en format Blu-ray et le film en format DVD, et qui est sorti le 23 novembre 2010.\\n R\\u00e9compenses\\n Nominations\\n Ce premier long-m\\u00e9trage des studios Pixar marque un tournant dans l'histoire du dessin anim\\u00e9\\u00a0: c'est le premier film enti\\u00e8rement r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 en images de synth\\u00e8se 3D\\u00a0; coproduit par les studios Disney, il inaugure une suite de succ\\u00e8s parmi lesquels 1001 pattes (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monstres et Cie (2001), Le Monde de Nemo (2003), Les Indestructibles (2004), Cars (2006), Ratatouille (2007), WALL-E (2008), L\\u00e0-haut (2009) et Toy Story 3 (2010).\\n Amor\\u00e7ant une tradition chez les studios Pixar, Toy Story renferme de multiples clins d'\\u0153il \\u00e0 l'industrie du cin\\u00e9ma. Par exemple, la th\\u00e9i\\u00e8re qu'utilise Hannah quand elle joue avec Buzz est une r\\u00e9plique de la th\\u00e9i\\u00e8re de l'Utah, mod\\u00e8le utilis\\u00e9 dans la synth\\u00e8se d'image 3D qui est devenu un objet standard de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence dans la communaut\\u00e9 de la synth\\u00e8se d'image. De nombreux clins d'\\u0153il sont plus particuli\\u00e8rement port\\u00e9s sur l'entreprise Disney. Lorsque Buzz veut prouver \\u00e0 Woody qu'il sait voler, une image de Mickey Mouse est cach\\u00e9e sur une r\\u00e9plique g\\u00e9ante de montre. Enfin, vers la fin du film, quand Woody et Buzz arrivent pr\\u00e8s de la voiture d'Andy en roulant et qu'on les voit dans le r\\u00e9troviseur, on peut entendre la chanson Hakuna matata du film d'animation Le Roi lion, sorti un an auparavant.\\n Le film est aussi parsem\\u00e9 de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences \\u00e0 l'histoire de Pixar et \\u00e0 ses courts m\\u00e9trages pass\\u00e9s. Quand le livreur de Pizza Planet entre dans la station-service Dinoco, il demande o\\u00f9 se situe le West Cutting Boulevard. C'\\u00e9tait en fait l'adresse des studios d'animation Pixar \\u00e0 Richmond (Californie), \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9poque de la r\\u00e9alisation du film. Depuis 2000, les studios ont d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nag\\u00e9 \\u00e0 Emeryville (Californie). La lampe de bureau et le ballon jaune avec une \\u00e9toile rouge font r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence au premier court-m\\u00e9trage de Pixar, Luxo Jr. (1986),. Dans la sc\\u00e8ne o\\u00f9 Woody invite les jouets \\u00e0 se trouver un partenaire de d\\u00e9m\\u00e9nagement, on peut apercevoir en arri\\u00e8re-plan sur une \\u00e9tag\\u00e8re un livre intitul\\u00e9 Tin Toy dont l'auteur mentionn\\u00e9 est Lasseter (une r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 John Lasseter). C'est de ce court-m\\u00e9trage r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9 en 1988 par Lasseter que Toy Story est inspir\\u00e9. On trouve aussi un livre nomm\\u00e9 Knick Knack, autre court m\\u00e9trage de Pixar, datant lui de 1989.\\n Toy Story marque \\u00e9galement le d\\u00e9but d'une longue liste d'apparitions d'objets r\\u00e9currents dans les films sign\\u00e9s Pixar. Le code A113, qui \\u00e9tait \\u00e0 l'origine le num\\u00e9ro d'une classe de CalArts (\\u00e9cole o\\u00f9 ont travaill\\u00e9 John Lasseter et Brad Bird) et qui appara\\u00eetra dans tous les autres longs m\\u00e9trages de Pixar, appara\\u00eet dans le film, sur la plaque d'immatriculation du monospace de la m\\u00e8re d'Andy. Figure \\u00e9galement dans le film la compagnie Dinoco, qui sera aussi pr\\u00e9sente dans Cars et WALL-E, ainsi que la cha\\u00eene de pizzerias Pizza Planet, dont le camion appara\\u00eetra dans la quasi-int\\u00e9gralit\\u00e9 des longs m\\u00e9trages de Pixar. Quand Luxo Junior bouscule Buzz par la fen\\u00eatre ouverte, celui-ci pousse le c\\u00e9l\\u00e8bre cri Wilhelm qui pourra \\u00eatre entendu \\u00e9galement dans Toy Story 3.\\n Le sol o\\u00f9 se trouvent Woody et Buzz quand ils tentent de s'\\u00e9chapper de la maison de Sid fait r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 celui de l'h\\u00f4tel Overlook dans Shining.\\n Diff\\u00e9rents auteurs ont vu de l'humanisme dans le film et l'ont rapproch\\u00e9 du roman Don Quichotte,. Bruce R. Burningham a \\u00e9tabli des comparaisons entre les personnages des deux \\u0153uvres. Ainsi, Buzz l'\\u00c9clair se rapprocherait de Don Quichotte alors que Woody est compar\\u00e9 \\u00e0 Sancho Panza. Burningham avance que ce dernier, au cours du film, \\u00e9prouve des difficult\\u00e9s dues \\u00e0 ses rapports avec Buzz, un nouveau venu plein d'illusions. Rossinante, le cheval de Don Quichotte, serait devenu le vaisseau spatial accident\\u00e9 de Buzz. Il souligne toutefois que Dulcin\\u00e9e n'a pas d'\\u00e9quivalent dans le film de Pixar. Pour lui, cela vient du fait que dans la tradition chevaleresque, chaque chevalier a une femme \\u00e0 qui il peut se confier, tandis que les codes de la science-fiction ne pr\\u00e9voient pas de personnage qui aurait un tel r\\u00f4le vis-\\u00e0-vis des rangers de l'espace.\\n Burningham met \\u00e9galement en \\u00e9vidence un lien entre les histoires de Toy Story et de Don Quichotte\\u00a0: comme Don Quichotte, dont la g\\u00e9n\\u00e9alogie est d\\u00e9lib\\u00e9r\\u00e9ment ambigu\\u00eb, Buzz n'a pas de v\\u00e9ritable histoire avant le d\\u00e9but du film. Il se r\\u00e9veille ex nihilo de son \\u00ab\\u00a0hypersomnolence\\u00a0\\u00bb, aussi vite qu'Alonso Quichano se d\\u00e9couvre une nouvelle identit\\u00e9 dans le premier chapitre. Plus loin dans le film, Buzz essaie de trouver un \\u00ab\\u00a0vaisseau\\u00a0\\u00bb pour revenir sur sa \\u00ab\\u00a0plan\\u00e8te\\u00a0\\u00bb pendant que Woody tente de trouver un moyen de revenir avec Buzz dans la chambre d'Andy, et ce en se servant des illusions de Buzz. Pour Burningham, cette situation est calqu\\u00e9e sur le sch\\u00e9ma narratif du roman de Cervantes, o\\u00f9 Sancho, tout comme Woody, apprend vite \\u00e0 se servir des r\\u00eaves de son ma\\u00eetre pour arriver \\u00e0 ses propres fins.\\n Toy Story a eu un impact important sur l'industrie cin\\u00e9matographique de par le c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 innovant de l'animation en images de synth\\u00e8se. Apr\\u00e8s la sortie du film, diverses industries se sont int\\u00e9ress\\u00e9es \\u00e0 la technologie utilis\\u00e9e dans le film. Les fabricants de cartes graphiques ont souhait\\u00e9 pouvoir cr\\u00e9er des images similaires \\u00e0 celles du film pour les ordinateurs personnels, les d\\u00e9veloppeurs de jeu vid\\u00e9o ont voulu apprendre \\u00e0 reproduire ce type d'animation dans leurs jeux et les chercheurs en robotique se sont pench\\u00e9s sur la mise en place d'une intelligence artificielle dans leurs robots pour que ceux-ci aient un comportement proche de celui des personnages du film.\\n \\nD'apr\\u00e8s Jason Bosse, \\u00ab\\u00a0tous ceux qui travaillent dans l'animation traditionnelle ont compris qu'il fallait se surpasser, faire jouer les personnages de fa\\u00e7on plus vraie, et non pas se contenter du style traditionnel qui \\u00e9tait appliqu\\u00e9 depuis 20\\u00a0ans\\u00a0\\u00bb .  \\u00ab\\u00a0Nous n'aurions pas pu faire ce film par la voie de l'animation traditionnelle. C'est une histoire qui ne peut \\u00eatre racont\\u00e9e qu'avec des personnages en trois dimensions\\u2026 Certains des plans du film sont si beaux.\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0Tom Schumacher, vice-pr\\u00e9sident de Walt Disney Feature Animation Le personnage de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair et sa phrase phare, \\u00ab\\u00a0Vers l'infini et au-del\\u00e0\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb (au Qu\\u00e9bec, \\u00ab\\u00a0Vers l'infini et plus loin encore\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb), ont particip\\u00e9 \\u00e0 la renomm\\u00e9e du film. Le personnage est si populaire qu'en 2008, des astronautes ont emmen\\u00e9 une figurine de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair dans l'espace \\u00e0 bord de la navette spatiale Discovery pour le tournage d'un film p\\u00e9dagogique.\\n La phrase \\u00ab\\u00a0Vers l'infini et au-del\\u00e0\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb est apparue sur plusieurs tee-shirts tir\\u00e9s du film. De par sa grande popularit\\u00e9, elle a m\\u00eame \\u00e9t\\u00e9 utilis\\u00e9e par quelques philosophes et math\\u00e9maticiens dans leurs publications,,. En 2008, cette phrase a de nouveau fait le tour des nouvelles mondiales lorsqu'on a appris qu'un p\\u00e8re et son fils, tout au long des 15\\u00a0heures pendant lesquelles ils ont nag\\u00e9 dans l'oc\\u00e9an Atlantique, avaient continuellement r\\u00e9p\\u00e9t\\u00e9 cette phrase afin de ne pas se perdre mutuellement,.\\n Buzz ainsi que les autres personnages du film font d\\u00e9sormais partie de la culture populaire\\u00a0: Debian, un syst\\u00e8me d'exploitation libre pour ordinateur, \\u00e0 la suite de la d\\u00e9cision de Bruce Perens le chef de projet de l'\\u00e9poque qui travaillait aussi pour Pixar, a baptis\\u00e9 ses versions successives des noms des personnages du film\\u00a0; \\u00e0 savoir Buzz, Rex, Bo, Hamm, Slink, Potato, Woody, Sarge, Etch, Lenny, Squeeze, Wheezy, Jessie, Etch, Sid et Buster. Le logo en forme de spirale de Debian serait inspir\\u00e9, selon Martin Krafft par la forme particuli\\u00e8re du menton de Buzz.\\n La bande originale de Toy Story a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 produite par Walt Disney Records et est sortie le 22 novembre 1995, la semaine de la sortie du film. Compos\\u00e9e et \\u00e9crite par Randy Newman, la bande originale a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 lou\\u00e9e pour sa musique \\u00ab\\u00a0vive et remuante\\u00a0\\u00bb. Mais en d\\u00e9pit de ce succ\\u00e8s critique, l'album ne d\\u00e9passera pas la place 94 du Billboard 200.\\n Je suis ton ami est aussi sorti sous forme de single en cassette audio et en CD le 12 avril 1996 afin de promouvoir la sortie de la bande originale. En 2006, la bande originale a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 remasteris\\u00e9e et, bien qu'elle ne soit plus disponible en magasin, elle est achetable sur des plates-formes telles que iTunes.\\n Toy Story a donn\\u00e9 lieu \\u00e0 trois suites, Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010) et Toy Story 4  (2019) et \\u00e0 une s\\u00e9rie d'animation, Les Aventures de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, dont le prologue, Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, le film\\u00a0: Le D\\u00e9but des aventures, est sorti en vid\\u00e9o.\\n Au d\\u00e9part, il \\u00e9tait pr\\u00e9vu que la suite de Toy Story, dont le d\\u00e9veloppement a commenc\\u00e9 en 1996, sorte directement en vid\\u00e9ofilm. Cependant, comme l'histoire \\u00e9tait consid\\u00e9r\\u00e9e assez bonne pour ne pas sortir directement en vid\\u00e9o, il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 annonc\\u00e9 en 1998 que la suite sortirait en salles. L'enregistrement des voix de Toy Story 2, dans lequel Woody est vol\\u00e9 durant un vide-greniers, a vu le retour de la majorit\\u00e9 des voix pr\\u00e9sentes dans le premier volet. La critique a encore mieux accueilli ce deuxi\\u00e8me volet que le premier, Toy Story 2 parvenant m\\u00eame \\u00e0 d\\u00e9crocher un \\u2014 ce qui est pourtant peu fr\\u00e9quent \\u2014 100\\u00a0% sur le site Rotten Tomatoes, note bas\\u00e9e sur 25\\u00a0critiques. Le film a recueilli 485\\u00a0015\\u00a0179\\u00a0$ de recettes \\u00e0 l'international, ce qui en faisait, en son temps, le deuxi\\u00e8me plus gros succ\\u00e8s des films d'animation, apr\\u00e8s Le Roi lion,.\\n Toy Story a \\u00e9galement donn\\u00e9 lieu \\u00e0 un spin-off directement sorti en vid\\u00e9o, Buzz l'\\u00c9clair, le film\\u00a0: Le D\\u00e9but des aventures, prologue de la s\\u00e9rie Les Aventures de Buzz l'\\u00c9clair. Le film et la s\\u00e9rie suivent Buzz l'\\u00c9clair et ses amis qui tentent de maintenir la justice dans la galaxie. Bien que le film ait \\u00e9t\\u00e9 critiqu\\u00e9 car il n'utilisait pas le m\\u00eame type d'animation que Toy Story et Toy Story 2, pr\\u00e8s de 3\\u00a0millions de VHS et DVD du film se sont vendus la premi\\u00e8re semaine de sa sortie,.

Ce travail a dur\\u00e9 quatre mois, et il a fallu six mois suppl\\u00e9mentaires pour ajouter la 3D aux deux films. Le principal st\\u00e9r\\u00e9ographe Bob Whitehill a supervis\\u00e9 ce travail en cherchant \\u00e0 obtenir un rendu qui ait une influence \\u00e9motionnelle sur la narration du film\\u00a0:\\n \\u00ab\\u00a0Pour chercher les meilleures fa\\u00e7ons d'utiliser la 3D au profit de l'histoire d'un film, je regarde le film dans son ensemble. Par exemple, dans Toy Story, lorsque les jouets sont seuls dans leur monde, je voulais rendre l'impression d'un monde o\\u00f9 l'on vit en s\\u00e9curit\\u00e9. Et lorsqu'ils sortent dans le monde des hommes, c'est l\\u00e0 que je fais r\\u00e9ellement intervenir la 3D pour bien refl\\u00e9ter le fait que ce monde est dangereux, compliqu\\u00e9 et bouleversant.\\u00a0\\u00bb\\n \\u2014\\u00a0Bob Whitehill La reprise en 3D du film a obtenu de bons r\\u00e9sultats au box-office am\\u00e9ricain, recueillant 12\\u00a0491\\u00a0789\\u00a0$ lors du premier week-end d'exploitation, le pla\\u00e7ant alors troisi\\u00e8me derri\\u00e8re Bienvenue \\u00e0 Zombieland et Temp\\u00eate de boulettes g\\u00e9antes.\\n En novembre 1996, le spectacle sur glace Disney on Ice\\u00a0: Toy Story a ouvert ses portes.

Pour les autres significations, voir Alice au pays des merveilles (homonymie).\\n \\n Les Aventures d'Alice au pays des merveilles (titre original\\u00a0: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland), fr\\u00e9quemment abr\\u00e9g\\u00e9 en Alice au pays des merveilles, est un roman publi\\u00e9 en 1865 par Lewis Carroll. Il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 traduit en fran\\u00e7ais pour la premi\\u00e8re fois en 1869 par la m\\u00eame maison d'\\u00e9dition (Macmillan and Co).\\n Lors de sa premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9criture, le livre n'\\u00e9tait pas destin\\u00e9 aux enfants. L'\\u00e9criture fut reprise une seconde fois pour les enfants en conservant les personnages merveilleux qui la rendaient si attrayante pour ce jeune public. Le roman foisonne d'allusions satiriques aux amis de l'\\u00e9crivain et aux le\\u00e7ons que les \\u00e9coliers britanniques devaient m\\u00e9moriser \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9poque. Le pays des merveilles d\\u00e9crit dans le conte joue sans cesse avec la logique. L'ouvrage reste populaire au XXIe\\u00a0si\\u00e8cle, aussi bien aupr\\u00e8s des enfants que des adultes.\\n Le livre a connu une suite intitul\\u00e9e De l'autre c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 du miroir. Les adaptations cin\\u00e9matographiques combinent souvent des \\u00e9l\\u00e9ments des deux livres. L'\\u00e9crivain am\\u00e9ricain Martin Gardner a publi\\u00e9 The Annotated Alice, qui regroupe Alice au pays des merveilles et De l'autre c\\u00f4t\\u00e9 du miroir accompagn\\u00e9s des po\\u00e8mes victoriens que Lewis Carroll parodia dans le corps du texte.\\n Le livre a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 publi\\u00e9 le 4 juillet 1865, trois ans jour pour jour apr\\u00e8s une promenade en barque sur l'Isis (qui coule \\u00e0 Oxford) effectu\\u00e9e par les r\\u00e9v\\u00e9rends Dodgson (Carroll) et Robinson Duckworth en compagnie de trois jeunes filles\\u00a0:\\n L'excursion commen\\u00e7a au pont Folly pr\\u00e8s d'Oxford et finit une dizaine de kilom\\u00e8tres plus loin dans le village de Godstow. Durant le trajet, Dodgson raconta aux s\\u0153urs Liddell une histoire qu'il venait d'inventer. Celle-ci fut suivie plus tard par Alice's Adventures Underground et finit par devenir Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\\n En 1998, un exemplaire de la premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9dition a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 vendu 1,5 million de dollars, ce qui est une vente record pour un livre pour enfants. Seuls vingt-deux exemplaires de la premi\\u00e8re \\u00e9dition de 1865 auraient surv\\u00e9cu. Dix-sept d'entre eux se trouvent dans des biblioth\\u00e8ques et cinq chez des particuliers.\\n Alice s'ennuie aupr\\u00e8s de sa s\\u0153ur qui lit un livre (\\u00ab\\u00a0sans images, ni dialogues\\u00a0\\u00bb) tandis qu'elle ne fait rien. \\u00ab\\u00a0\\u00c0 quoi bon un livre sans images, ni dialogues\\u00a0?\\u00a0\\u00bb, se demande Alice. Mais voil\\u00e0 qu'un lapin blanc aux yeux roses v\\u00eatu d'une redingote avec une montre \\u00e0 gousset \\u00e0 y ranger passe pr\\u00e8s d'elle en courant. Cela ne l'\\u00e9tonne pas le moins du monde. Pourtant, lorsqu'elle le voit sortir une montre de sa poche et s'\\u00e9crier\\u00a0: \\u00ab\\u00a0Je suis en retard\\u00a0! En retard\\u00a0! En retard\\u00a0!\\u00a0\\u00bb, elle se dit que d\\u00e9cid\\u00e9ment ce lapin a quelque chose de particulier. En entrant derri\\u00e8re lui dans son terrier, elle fait une chute presque interminable qui l'emm\\u00e8ne dans un monde aux antipodes du sien. Elle va rencontrer une galerie de personnages retors et se trouver confront\\u00e9e au paradoxe, \\u00e0 l'absurde et au bizarre\\u2026\\n Alice suit un lapin dans son terrier. Puis elle trouve une cl\\u00e9 qui m\\u00e8ne \\u00e0 un joli jardin. Elle boit une boisson \\u00e9tiquet\\u00e9e \\\"bois-moi\\\" et mange un g\\u00e2teau \\u00e9tiquet\\u00e9 \\\"mange-moi\\\" qui la fait r\\u00e9tr\\u00e9cir afin qu'elle puisse entrer dans le jardin.\\n Alice rencontre une souris fran\\u00e7aise et elle essaie de converser en fran\\u00e7ais \\u00e9l\\u00e9mentaire. Elle offense alors la souris qui tente de lui \\u00e9chapper.\\n Alice participe \\u00e0 une course avec les animaux du groupe mais elle les fait fuir en parlant de son f\\u00e9roce chat[N 1].\\n Le lapin blanc r\\u00e9appara\\u00eet alors qu'il cherche les gants et l'\\u00e9ventail de la duchesse et demande \\u00e0 Alice de l'aider. Alice boit dans une petite bouteille et commence \\u00e0 devenir g\\u00e9ante, mais trouve ensuite des petits g\\u00e2teaux pour l'aider \\u00e0 se r\\u00e9duire \\u00e0 sa taille normale.\\n Alice trouve un champignon et une chenille qui fume un narguil\\u00e9. Elle parvient \\u00e0 manger les bonnes quantit\\u00e9s de champignon pour qu'elle puisse retrouver sa taille normale parce qu'elle pense qu'elle a perdu son identit\\u00e9,.\\n La duchesse donne \\u00e0 Alice un b\\u00e9b\\u00e9 qui se transforme en cochon, puis la petite fille rencontre le chat du Cheshire.\\n Alice assiste \\u00e0 un go\\u00fbter avec le Li\\u00e8vre de mars, le Chapelier fou et un Loir tr\\u00e8s fatigu\\u00e9. Ils donnent \\u00e0 Alice de nombreuses \\u00e9nigmes \\u00e0 r\\u00e9soudre, alors Alice dit que c'est le go\\u00fbter le plus stupide auquel elle ait jamais assist\\u00e9.\\n Alice quitte la f\\u00eate et trouve trois cartes peignant les roses blanches, parce que la Reine de c\\u0153ur d\\u00e9teste les roses blanches. Alice rencontre alors le roi et la reine et est invit\\u00e9e \\u00e0 jouer au croquet avec eux.\\n Alice est pr\\u00e9sent\\u00e9e au Griffon qui l'emm\\u00e8ne chez la fausse tortue, qui est tr\\u00e8s triste.\\n Alice r\\u00e9cite le quadrille du homard et la danse des fausses tortues et des griffons.\\n Le valet de c\\u0153ur est accus\\u00e9 d'avoir vol\\u00e9 les tartes de la reine.\\n Alice est appel\\u00e9e comme t\\u00e9moin, mais elle est accus\\u00e9e du crime. La reine ordonne \\u00ab\\u00a0de lui couper la t\\u00eate\\u00a0\\u00bb, mais avant qu'Alice ne soit tu\\u00e9e, sa s\\u0153ur la r\\u00e9veille du r\\u00eave.\\n Dans 'The Annotated Alice\\u00a0(en)', Martin Gardner fournit des informations g\\u00e9n\\u00e9rales sur les personnages. Gardner a sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 que le Chapelier est une r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence \\u00e0 Theophilus Carter\\u00a0(en), un marchand de meubles connu \\u00e0 Oxford, et que Tenniel a apparemment dessin\\u00e9 le Chapelier pour qu'il ressemble \\u00e0 Carter, sur une suggestion de Carroll.\\n La fausse tortue est une r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rence au critique d'art John Ruskin, qui venait une fois par semaine \\u00e0 la maison Liddell pour enseigner aux enfants le dessin, le croquis et la peinture \\u00e0 l'huile.\\n Lewis Carroll r\\u00e9alisa lui-m\\u00eame 37 dessins \\u00e0 la plume dans l'exemplaire manuscrit de l'histoire qu'il offrit \\u00e0 Alice Liddell, le 26 novembre 1864. Une \\u00e9dition en fac simil\\u00e9 (avec une traduction fran\\u00e7aise) a d'ailleurs \\u00e9t\\u00e9 r\\u00e9alis\\u00e9e par les \\u00e9ditions Fr\\u00e9mok en 2006.\\n Les sources divergent sur la question de savoir si c'est Dodgson ou son \\u00e9diteur qui jugea bon de ne pas garder ses propres images. C'est en tout cas Lewis Carroll qui opta pour John Tenniel, dessinateur alors r\\u00e9put\\u00e9 pour sa participation \\u00e0 la revue satirique Punch.\\n Bien que les illustrations de John Tenniel restent tr\\u00e8s associ\\u00e9es \\u00e0 l'\\u0153uvre, le texte de Carroll a inspir\\u00e9 un grand nombre d'illustrateurs au fil du temps. Plusieurs centaines de versions ont ainsi vu le jour. Parmi les plus notables\\u00a0:\\n Carroll a \\u00e9crit beaucoup de chansons et po\\u00e8mes pour 'Les Aventures d'Alice au pays des merveilles' notamment\\u00a0:\\n Martin Gardner et d'autres sp\\u00e9cialistes ont montr\\u00e9 que le livre est rempli de nombreuses parodies de la culture populaire victorienne, sugg\\u00e9rant qu'il appartient dans l'esprit \\u00e0 Topsyturveydom de W. S. Gilbert et Alfred Cellier.\\n La plupart des aventures du livre peuvent avoir \\u00e9t\\u00e9 bas\\u00e9es sur ou influenc\\u00e9es par des personnes, des situations et des b\\u00e2timents \\u00e0 Oxford et \\u00e0 Christ Church. Par exemple, le \\\"Rabbit Hole\\\" symbolisait les v\\u00e9ritables escaliers situ\\u00e9s \\u00e0 l'arri\\u00e8re de la salle principale de Christ Church. Une sculpture repr\\u00e9sentant un griffon et un lapin, telle qu'on peut la voir dans la cath\\u00e9drale de Ripon, o\\u00f9 le p\\u00e8re de Carroll \\u00e9tait chanoine, a peut-\\u00eatre inspir\\u00e9 le conte.\\n Dans le huiti\\u00e8me chapitre, trois cartes peignent en rouge les roses d'un rosier, parce qu'elles avaient accidentellement plant\\u00e9 un rosier blanc que la reine de c\\u0153ur d\\u00e9teste. Les roses rouges symbolisaient la maison anglaise des Lancaster, tandis que les roses blanches symbolisaient leur maison rivale des York, et les guerres qui les opposaient \\u00e9taient donc les guerres des Roses.\\n Si le livre est rest\\u00e9 imprim\\u00e9 et inspire continuellement de nouvelles adaptations, le mat\\u00e9riel culturel dont il s'inspire est devenu un savoir largement sp\\u00e9cialis\\u00e9. Le Dr Leon Coward affirme que le livre \\\"souffre\\\" de \\\"lectures qui refl\\u00e8tent la fascination d'aujourd'hui pour le postmodernisme et la psychologie, plut\\u00f4t que de se plonger dans une interpr\\u00e9tation historiquement inform\\u00e9e\\\", et suppose que cela est d\\u00fb en partie au fait que le public d\\u00e9couvre le r\\u00e9cit \\u00e0 travers une source \\\"de seconde main\\\", expliquant que \\\"nos impressions du texte original sont bas\\u00e9es sur une multiplicit\\u00e9 de r\\u00e9interpr\\u00e9tations. Nous ne r\\u00e9alisons pas n\\u00e9cessairement que nous manquons quelque chose dans la compr\\u00e9hension du produit original, parce que nous n'avons g\\u00e9n\\u00e9ralement jamais affaire au produit original\\\".\\n Plusieurs personnes, dont Martin Gardner et Selwyn Goodacre, ont sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 que Dodgson s'int\\u00e9ressait \\u00e0 la langue fran\\u00e7aise, choisissant d'y faire des r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences et des jeux de mots dans l'histoire. Il est plus que probable qu'il s'agisse de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences aux le\\u00e7ons de fran\\u00e7ais - une caract\\u00e9ristique commune de l'\\u00e9ducation d'une fille de la classe moyenne victorienne. Par exemple, dans le deuxi\\u00e8me chapitre, Alice suppose que la souris est peut-\\u00eatre fran\\u00e7aise. Elle choisit donc de lui dire la premi\\u00e8re phrase de son livre de cours de fran\\u00e7ais\\u00a0: \\\"O\\u00f9 est ma chatte\\u00a0?\\\" (\\\"Where is my cat?\\\"). Dans la traduction fran\\u00e7aise d'Henri Bu\\u00e9, Alice suppose que la souris est peut-\\u00eatre italienne et lui parle en italien.\\n L'expression \\\" Digging for apples \\\" de Pat pourrait \\u00eatre un jeu de mots interlinguistique, puisque pomme de terre signifie pomme de terre et pomme signifie pomme.\\n Dans le deuxi\\u00e8me chapitre, Alice s'adresse d'abord \\u00e0 la souris en disant \\\" O Souris \\\", en se basant sur son souvenir des d\\u00e9clinaisons du nom \\\" dans la grammaire latine de son fr\\u00e8re, 'Une souris - d'une souris - \\u00e0 une souris - une souris - O souris\\u00a0!' \\\". Ces mots correspondent aux cinq premiers des six cas du latin, dans un ordre traditionnel \\u00e9tabli par les grammairiens m\\u00e9di\\u00e9vaux\\u00a0: mus (nominatif), muris (g\\u00e9nitif), muri (datif), murem (accusatif), (O) mus (vocatif). Le sixi\\u00e8me cas, mure (ablatif) est absent de la r\\u00e9citation d'Alice. Nilson a plausiblement sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 que l'absence de l'ablatif d'Alice est un jeu de mots sur le travail de son p\\u00e8re Henry Liddell sur le standard A Greek-English Lexicon puisque le grec ancien n'a pas de cas ablatif. De plus, Mousa (signifiant muse) \\u00e9tait un nom mod\\u00e8le standard dans les livres grecs de l'\\u00e9poque dans les paradigmes de la premi\\u00e8re d\\u00e9clinaison, nom court-alpha. En outre, la phrase \\\"O Muse, sing...\\\" ou une variante proche de celle-ci figure dans de nombreuses traductions anglaises d'Hom\\u00e8re, la prononciation par Alice de \\\"O Mouse\\\" formant un jeu de mots qui aurait \\u00e9t\\u00e9 apparent pour les plus instruits parmi le lectorat victorien de Dodgson, \\u00e9tant donn\\u00e9 la relative importance des lettres classiques dans les programmes d'enseignement des classes sup\\u00e9rieures britanniques \\u00e0 cette \\u00e9poque.\\n Comme Carroll \\u00e9tait math\\u00e9maticien \\u00e0 Christ Church, il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 sugg\\u00e9r\\u00e9 qu'il y a beaucoup de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences et de concepts math\\u00e9matiques dans cette histoire et dans Through the Looking-Glass. La sp\\u00e9cialiste de la litt\\u00e9rature Melanie Bayley a affirm\\u00e9 dans le magazine New Scientist que Dodgson a \\u00e9crit Alice au pays des merveilles dans sa forme finale comme une satire cinglante des nouvelles math\\u00e9matiques modernes qui \\u00e9mergeaient au milieu du XIXe si\\u00e8cle,.\\n Voici quelques exemples de r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences aux math\\u00e9matiques dans Alice\\u00a0:\\n Chapitre 1 (\\\" Down the Rabbit-Hole \\\")\\u00a0: alors qu'elle r\\u00e9tr\\u00e9cit, Alice s'interroge avec philosophie sur la taille finale qu'elle atteindra, peut-\\u00eatre \\\" en s'\\u00e9teignant compl\\u00e8tement, comme une bougie \\\"\\u00a0; cette r\\u00e9flexion refl\\u00e8te le concept de limite.\\n Chapitre 2 (\\\"La piscine de larmes\\\")\\u00a0: Alice essaie d'effectuer une multiplication mais obtient des r\\u00e9sultats \\u00e9tranges\\u00a0: \\\"Voyons voir\\u00a0: quatre fois cinq font douze, quatre fois six font treize, et quatre fois sept font... Oh l\\u00e0 l\\u00e0\\u00a0! Je n'arriverai jamais \\u00e0 vingt \\u00e0 ce rythme\\u00a0!\\\" On explore ainsi la repr\\u00e9sentation des nombres \\u00e0 l'aide de diff\\u00e9rentes bases et syst\\u00e8mes num\\u00e9raux positionnels\\u00a0: 4 \\u00d7 5 = 12 en notation de base 18, 4 \\u00d7 6 = 13 en notation de base 21 et 4 \\u00d7 7 = 14 en notation de base 24. En continuant cette s\\u00e9quence, en augmentant de trois bases \\u00e0 chaque fois, le r\\u00e9sultat sera toujours inf\\u00e9rieur \\u00e0 20 dans la notation de la base correspondante. (Apr\\u00e8s 4 \\u00d7 12 = 19 en base 39, le produit serait 4 \\u00d7 13 = 1A en base 42, puis 1B, 1C, 1D, et ainsi de suite).\\n Chapitre 7 (\\\"Un Tea-Party fou\\\")\\u00a0: Le Li\\u00e8vre de mars, le Chapelier et le Loir donnent plusieurs exemples dans lesquels la valeur s\\u00e9mantique d'une phrase A n'est pas la m\\u00eame que celle du contraire de A (par exemple, \\\"On pourrait tout aussi bien dire que \\\"Je vois ce que je mange\\\" est la m\\u00eame chose que \\\"Je mange ce que je vois\\\"\\u00a0!\\\")\\u00a0; en logique et en math\\u00e9matiques, on parle de relation inverse. Alice se demande \\u00e9galement ce que signifie le fait que le changement de si\\u00e8ge autour de la table circulaire les ram\\u00e8ne au d\\u00e9but. Il s'agit d'une observation de l'addition sur l'anneau des nombres entiers modulo N.\\n Le chat du Cheshire s'estompe jusqu'\\u00e0 dispara\\u00eetre compl\\u00e8tement, ne laissant que son large sourire suspendu dans l'air, ce qui am\\u00e8ne Alice \\u00e0 s'\\u00e9merveiller et \\u00e0 noter qu'elle a vu un chat sans sourire, mais jamais un sourire sans chat. L'abstraction profonde des concepts, comme la g\\u00e9om\\u00e9trie non euclidienne, l'alg\\u00e8bre abstraite et les d\\u00e9buts de la logique math\\u00e9matique, s'emparait des math\\u00e9matiques \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9poque o\\u00f9 Dodgson \\u00e9crivait. La d\\u00e9limitation par Dodgson de la relation entre le chat et le grin peut \\u00eatre consid\\u00e9r\\u00e9e comme repr\\u00e9sentant le concept m\\u00eame des math\\u00e9matiques et du nombre. Par exemple, au lieu de consid\\u00e9rer deux ou trois pommes, on peut facilement consid\\u00e9rer le concept de \\\"pomme\\\", dont les concepts de \\\"deux\\\" et \\\"trois\\\" semblent d\\u00e9pendre. Un saut beaucoup plus sophistiqu\\u00e9 consiste \\u00e0 consid\\u00e9rer les concepts de \\\"deux\\\" et \\\"trois\\\" par eux-m\\u00eames, tout comme un sourire, qui semblait \\u00e0 l'origine d\\u00e9pendre du chat, s\\u00e9par\\u00e9 conceptuellement de son objet physique.\\n Carina Garland note comment le monde est \\\"exprim\\u00e9 par des repr\\u00e9sentations de la nourriture et de l'app\\u00e9tit\\\", citant le d\\u00e9sir fr\\u00e9quent d'Alice de consommer (\\u00e0 la fois de la nourriture et des mots), ses \\\"app\\u00e9tits curieux\\\". Souvent, l'id\\u00e9e de manger co\\u00efncide avec des images macabres. Apr\\u00e8s l'\\u00e9nigme \\\"Pourquoi un corbeau ressemble-t-il \\u00e0 un pupitre\\u00a0?\\\", le Chapelier affirme qu'Alice pourrait tout aussi bien dire \\\"Je vois ce que je mange... je mange ce que je vois\\\" et la solution de l'\\u00e9nigme, propos\\u00e9e par Boe Birns, pourrait donc \\u00eatre la suivante\\u00a0: \\\"Un corbeau mange des vers\\u00a0; un pupitre est mang\\u00e9 par des vers\\\"\\u00a0; cette id\\u00e9e de nourriture r\\u00e9sume l'id\\u00e9e de la vie qui se nourrit de la vie elle-m\\u00eame, car le ver est mang\\u00e9 et devient ensuite le mangeur - une image horrible de la mortalit\\u00e9.\\n Nina Auerbach explique que le roman tourne autour du boire et du manger, ce qui \\\"motive une grande partie de son comportement [celui d'Alice]\\\", car l'histoire porte essentiellement sur les choses qui \\\"entrent et sortent de sa bouche\\\". Les animaux du pays des merveilles sont particuli\\u00e8rement int\\u00e9ressants, car la relation d'Alice avec eux change constamment. En effet, comme le dit Lovell-Smith, les changements de taille d'Alice la repositionnent continuellement dans la cha\\u00eene alimentaire, ce qui lui fait prendre conscience de l'attitude \\\"manger ou \\u00eatre mang\\u00e9\\\" qui r\\u00e8gne au pays des merveilles.\\n Article principal\\u00a0: \\u0152uvres bas\\u00e9es sur Alice au pays des merveilles\\n En 2015, Robert Douglas-Fairhurst a \\u00e9crit dans The Guardian,\\n Depuis la premi\\u00e8re publication des Aventures d'Alice au pays des merveilles il y a 150 ans, l'\\u0153uvre de Lewis Carroll a donn\\u00e9 naissance \\u00e0 toute une industrie, des films aux man\\u00e8ges de parcs \\u00e0 th\\u00e8me en passant par des produits tels qu'un costume d'Alice \\\"mignonne et insolente\\\" (\\\"jupon et bas non inclus\\\"). La petite fille au visage vide rendue c\\u00e9l\\u00e8bre par les illustrations originales de John Tenniel est devenue une tache d'encre culturelle que nous pouvons interpr\\u00e9ter comme bon nous semble.\\n Alice et le reste du Pays des Merveilles continuent d'inspirer ou d'influencer de nombreuses autres \\u0153uvres d'art jusqu'\\u00e0 aujourd'hui, parfois indirectement via le film Disney de 1951, par exemple. On trouve des r\\u00e9f\\u00e9rences, des hommages, des remaniements et des \\u0153uvres d\\u00e9riv\\u00e9es dans de nombreuses \\u0153uvres de litt\\u00e9rature, de cin\\u00e9ma, de th\\u00e9\\u00e2tre, d'art visuel, de musique et de jeux (comme les cartes \\u00e0 jouer).

Comment ajouter mes sources\\u00a0?\\n \\n Les Quatre Filles du docteur March (titre original\\u00a0: Little Women)  est un roman de l\\u2019autrice am\\u00e9ricaine Louisa May Alcott, publi\\u00e9 dans un premier temps en deux volumes. Le premier parut en 1868 et le second en 1869. \\u00c0 sa sortie, le premier volume connut un franc succ\\u00e8s, autant dans la presse qu'aupr\\u00e8s du public, tant et si bien que l'auteure compl\\u00e9ta son \\u0153uvre par un second volume, sorti en 1869. L'histoire de ces quatre s\\u0153urs a connu d'autant plus de succ\\u00e8s qu'elle a fait \\u00e9cho au quotidien de nombreuses familles am\\u00e9ricaines ayant v\\u00e9cu la guerre de S\\u00e9cession.\\n Ce roman est tir\\u00e9 de l'exp\\u00e9rience personnelle de Louisa May Alcott qui avait trois s\\u0153urs. Par ailleurs, le personnage de Jo semble inspir\\u00e9 de l'auteure elle-m\\u00eame. On peut ainsi consid\\u00e9rer qu'il s'agit d'une autobiographie romanc\\u00e9e.\\n En France, le roman a paru pour la premi\\u00e8re fois en 1880 aux \\u00e9ditions J. Hetzel sous le titre Les Quatre filles du docteur Marsch, traduit et adapt\\u00e9 au go\\u00fbt de l'\\u00e9poque par Pierre-Jules Hetzel sous son nom de plume de P.-J.

En l\\u2019absence de leur p\\u00e8re Robert, pasteur nordiste engag\\u00e9 comme aum\\u00f4nier dans le conflit, quatre jeunes s\\u0153urs issues de la classe moyenne de la soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 font face aux difficult\\u00e9s de la vie quotidienne en ce temps de guerre\\u00a0: la raisonnable Margaret (surnomm\\u00e9e Meg), l'intr\\u00e9pide Josephine (surnomm\\u00e9e Jo), la charitable Elisabeth (surnomm\\u00e9e Beth) et l'orgueilleuse Amy. Elles vivent \\u00e0 Concord dans l'\\u00c9tat du Massachusetts avec leur m\\u00e8re et leur fid\\u00e8le domestique, Hannah. Autrefois riche, la famille March a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 ruin\\u00e9e lorsque Robert March a fait faillite en aidant un ami dans ses affaires.

Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people over cargo. There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. The car is considered an important part of the developed economy.[citation needed]\\n The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor Fran\\u00e7ois Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car\\u2014a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use\\u2014was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, both American cars, are widely considered the first mass-produced and mass-affordable cars, respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages. In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II. In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialised countries.\\n Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than petrol-driven cars before 2025. The transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.\\n There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land-use, road congestion, air pollution, noise pollution, public health, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and the generation of revenue from taxation. People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.\\n The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum \\\"wheeled vehicle\\\" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre \\\"two-wheeled cart\\\", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros \\\"chariot\\\". It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.\\n \\\"Motor car\\\", attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British English. \\\"Autocar\\\", a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning \\\"self-propelled car\\\", is now considered archaic. \\\"Horseless carriage\\\" is attested from 1895.\\n \\\"Automobile\\\", a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek aut\\u00f3s (\\u03b1\\u1f50\\u03c4\\u03cc\\u03c2) \\\"self\\\" and Latin mobilis \\\"movable\\\", entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in 1897. It fell out of favour in Britain and is now used chiefly in North America, where the abbreviated form \\\"auto\\\" commonly appears as an adjective in compound formations like \\\"auto industry\\\" and \\\"auto mechanic\\\".\\n In 1649, Hans Hautsch of Nuremberg built a clockwork-driven carriage. The first steam-powered vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around 1672. It was a 65-centimetre-long (26\\u00a0in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger. It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or run.\\n Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle. He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts. His inventions were limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure. In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle. It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.\\n The development of external combustion (steam) engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars. A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. In the United Kingdom, sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.\\n In 1807, Nic\\u00e9phore Ni\\u00e9pce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyr\\u00e9olophore), but installed it in a boat on the river Saone in France. Coincidentally, in 1807, the Swiss inventor Fran\\u00e7ois Isaac de Rivaz designed his own \\\"de Rivaz internal combustion engine\\\", and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Ni\\u00e9pces' Pyr\\u00e9olophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. Neither design was successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir, who each built vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.\\n In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouv\\u00e9 demonstrated a three-wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity. Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus) were working on cars at about the same time, the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car\\u2014a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use\\u2014when the German Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen; he is generally acknowledged as the inventor of the car.\\n In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first Motorwagen was built in 1885 in Mannheim, Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, Benz & Cie., which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model. They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888, Bertha Benz, the wife and business partner of Carl Benz, undertook the first road trip by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband's invention.\\n In 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called boxermotor. During the last years of the 19th century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a joint-stock company. The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world, was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897, the Pr\\u00e4sident automobil.\\n Daimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name Daimler. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895, about 30\\u00a0vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach, and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other's early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG. Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35\\u00a0hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\\n In 1890, \\u00c9mile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France. In 1891, Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a petrol-driven vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type 3 completed 2,100 kilometres (1,300\\u00a0mi) from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first Paris\\u2013Brest\\u2013Paris bicycle race, but finished six days after the winning cyclist, Charles Terront.\\n The first design for an American car with a petrol internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by George Selden of Rochester, New York. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of 16 years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, Selden was granted a US patent (U.S. patent 549,160) for a two-stroke car engine, which hindered, more than encouraged, development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others, and overturned in 1911.\\n In 1893, the first running, petrol-driven American car was built and road-tested by the Duryea brothers of Springfield, Massachusetts. The first public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon took place on 21 September 1893, on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield. Studebaker, subsidiary of a long-established wagon and coach manufacturer, started to build cars in 1897:\\u200a66\\u200a and commenced sales of electric vehicles in 1902 and petrol vehicles in 1904.\\n In Britain, there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success, with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in 1860. Santler from Malvern is recognised by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first petrol-driven car in the country in 1894, followed by Frederick William Lanchester in 1895, but these were both one-offs. The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Company, a company founded by Harry J. Lawson in 1896, after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines. Lawson's company made its first car in 1897, and they bore the name Daimler.\\n In 1892, German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a \\\"New Rational Combustion Engine\\\". In 1897, he built the first diesel engine. Steam-, electric-, and petrol-driven vehicles competed for a few decades, with petrol internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design, only Mazda's version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success.\\n All in all, it is estimated that over 100,000\\u00a0patents created the modern automobile and motorcycle.\\n Large-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing, Michigan, and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the US by Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford, beginning in 1913 with the world's first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant.\\n As a result, Ford's cars came off the line in 15-minute intervals, much faster than previous methods, increasing productivity eightfold, while using less manpower (from 12.5\\u00a0manhours to 1\\u00a0hour 33\\u00a0minutes). It was so successful, paint became a bottleneck. Only Japan black would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colours available before 1913, until fast-drying Duco lacquer was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford's apocryphal remark, \\\"any color as long as it's black\\\". In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.\\n Ford's complex safety procedures\\u2014especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about\\u2014dramatically reduced the rate of injury. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \\\"Fordism\\\" and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the US. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\\n In the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citro\\u00ebn was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.\\n Development of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self-starter (both by Charles Kettering, for the Cadillac Motor Company in 1910\\u20131911), independent suspension, and four-wheel brakes.\\n Since the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was Alfred P. Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the General Motors Companion Make Program, so that buyers could \\\"move up\\\" as their fortunes improved.\\n Reflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, LaSalles, sold by Cadillac, used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile; in the 1950s, Chevrolet shared bonnet, doors, roof, and windows with Pontiac; by the 1990s, corporate powertrains and shared platforms (with interchangeable brakes, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as Apperson, Cole, Dorris, Haynes, or Premier, could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the Great Depression, by 1940, only 17 of those were left.\\n In Europe, much the same would happen. Morris set up its production line at Cowley in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford's practice of vertical integration, buying Hotchkiss' British subsidiary (engines), Wrigley (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as Wolseley: in 1925, Morris had 41\\u00a0per cent of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from Abbey to Xtra, had gone under. Citro\\u00ebn did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault's 10CV and Peugeot's 5CV, they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and Mors, Hurtu, and others could not compete. Germany's first mass-manufactured car, the Opel 4PS Laubfrosch (Tree Frog), came off the line at R\\u00fcsselsheim in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5\\u00a0per cent of the market.\\n In Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companies were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and these were small, three-wheeled for commercial uses, like Daihatsu, or were the result of partnering with European companies, like Isuzu building the Wolseley A-9 in 1922. Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle. Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Mazda, and Honda began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda's decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation, the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Subaru, meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries, as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation.\\n The transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution, noise pollution and climate change.\\n Most cars in use in the early 2020s run on petrol burnt in an internal combustion engine (ICE). The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers says that, in countries that mandate low sulphur motor spirit, petrol-fuelled cars built to late 2010s standards (such as Euro-6) emit very little local air pollution. Some cities ban older petrol-driven cars and some countries plan to ban sales in future. However, some environmental groups say this phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles must be brought forwards to limit climate change. Production of petrol-fuelled cars peaked in 2017.\\n Other hydrocarbon fossil fuels also burnt by deflagration (rather than detonation) in ICE cars include diesel, autogas, and CNG. Removal of fossil fuel subsidies, concerns about oil dependence, tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. This includes hybrid vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. Out of all cars sold in 2021, nine per cent were electric, and by the end of that year there were more than 16\\u00a0million electric cars on the world's roads. Despite rapid growth, less than two per cent of cars on the world's roads were fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars by the end of 2021. Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines, but these are impractical for common use.\\n Oil consumption has increased rapidly in the 20th and 21st centuries because there are more cars; the 1980s oil glut even fuelled the sales of low-economy vehicles in OECD countries. The BRIC countries are adding to this consumption.\\n As of 2023[update] few production cars use wheel hub motors.\\n In almost all hybrid (even mild hybrid) and pure electric cars regenerative braking recovers and returns to a battery some energy which would otherwise be wasted by friction brakes getting hot. Although all cars must have friction brakes (front disc brakes and either disc or drum rear brakes) for emergency stops, regenerative braking improves efficiency, particularly in city driving.\\n Cars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort, and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 21st-century cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation, and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example, the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.\\n Some of the original controls are no longer required. For example, all cars once had controls for the choke valve, clutch, ignition timing, and a crank instead of an electric starter. However, new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. These include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Another trend is the replacement of physical knobs and switches by secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW's iDrive and Ford's MyFord Touch. Another change is that while early cars' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the early 2020s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.\\n Cars are typically equipped with interior lighting which can be toggled manually or be set to light up automatically with doors open, an entertainment system which originated from car radios, sideways windows which can be lowered or raised electrically (manually on earlier cars), and one or multiple auxiliary power outlets for supplying portable appliances such as mobile phones, portable fridges, power inverters, and electrical air pumps from the on-board electrical system.[a] More costly upper-class and luxury cars are equipped with features earlier such as massage seats and collision avoidance systems.\\n Dedicated automotive fuses and circuit breakers prevent damage from electrical overload.\\n Cars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a boot light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.\\n During the late 20th and early 21st century, cars increased in weight due to batteries, modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and \\\"more-powerful\\u2014if more efficient\\u2014engines\\\" and, as of 2019[update], typically weigh between 1 and 3 tonnes (1.1 and 3.3 short tons; 0.98 and 2.95 long tons). Heavier cars are safer for the driver from a crash perspective, but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users. The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance, with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance. The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, a typical city car, weighs about 700 kilograms (1,500\\u00a0lb). Heavier cars include SUVs and extended-length SUVs like the Suburban. Cars have also become wider.\\n Some places tax heavier cars more: as well as improving pedestrian safety this can encourage manufacturers to use materials such as recycled aluminium instead of steel. It has been suggested that one benefit of subsidising charging infrastructure is that cars can use lighter batteries.\\n Most cars are designed to carry multiple occupants, often with four or five seats. Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear. Full-size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six, seven, or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats. On the other hand, sports cars are most often designed with only two seats. Utility vehicles like pickup trucks, combine seating with extra cargo or utility functionality. The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include, among others, the sedan/saloon, hatchback, station wagon/estate, coupe, and minivan.\\n Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Mary Ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown, Ireland, and Henry Bliss one of the US's first pedestrian car casualties in 1899 in New York City. There are now standard tests for safety in new cars, such as the Euro and US NCAP tests, and insurance-industry-backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). However, not all such tests consider the safety of people outside the car, such as drivers of other cars, pedestrians and cyclists.\\n The costs of car usage, which may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance, are weighed against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of the benefits\\u2014perceived and real\\u2014of vehicle usage. The benefits may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience, and emergency power. During the 1920s, cars had another benefit: \\\"[c]ouples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates, plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night.\\\"\\n Similarly the costs to society of car use may include; maintaining roads, land use, air pollution, noise pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life; and can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. Societal benefits may include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of car production and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability of humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.\\n Cars are a major cause of urban air pollution, with all types of cars producing dust from brakes, tyres, and road wear, although these may be limited by vehicle emission standards. While there are different ways to power cars, most rely on petrol or diesel, and they consume almost a quarter of world oil production as of 2019[update]. Both petrol and diesel cars pollute more than electric cars. Cars and vans caused 8% of direct carbon dioxide emissions in 2021. As of 2021[update], due to greenhouse gases emitted during battery production, electric cars must be driven tens of thousands of kilometres before their lifecycle carbon emissions are less than fossil fuel cars; however this varies considerably and is expected to improve in future due to lower carbon electricity, and longer lasting batteries produced in larger factories. Many governments use fiscal policies, such as road tax, to discourage the purchase and use of more polluting cars; and many cities are doing the same with low-emission zones. Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g., hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels.[citation needed] High fuel taxes or cultural change may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars,[citation needed] or to not drive.\\n The lifetime of a car built in the 2020s is expected to be about 16\\u00a0years, or about 2 millionkm (1.2 millionmiles) if driven a lot. According to the International Energy Agency the average rated fuel consumption of new light-duty vehicles fell by only 0.9% between 2017 and 2019, far smaller than the 1.8% annual average reduction between 2010 and 2015. Given slow progress to date, the IEA estimates fuel consumption will have to decrease by 4.3% per year on average from 2019 to 2030. The increase in sales of SUVs is bad for fuel economy. Many cities in Europe have banned older fossil fuel cars and all fossil fuel vehicles will be banned in Amsterdam from 2030. Many Chinese cities limit licensing of fossil fuel cars, and many countries plan to stop selling them between 2025 and 2050.\\n The manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive, and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories, including energy usage, waste and water consumption. Manufacturing each kWh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of petrol. The growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl, therefore encouraging more travel by car, resulting in inactivity and obesity, which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases.\\n Animals and plants are often negatively affected by cars via habitat destruction and pollution. Over the lifetime of the average car, the \\\"loss of habitat potential\\\" may be over 50,000 square metres (540,000\\u00a0sq\\u00a0ft) based on primary production correlations.[clarification needed] Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars, referred to as roadkill. More recent road developments are including significant environmental mitigation in their designs, such as green bridges (designed to allow wildlife crossings) and creating wildlife corridors.\\n Growth in the popularity of cars and commuting has led to traffic congestion. Moscow, Istanbul, Bogot\\u00e1, Mexico City and S\\u00e3o Paulo were the world's most congested cities in 2018 according to INRIX, a data analytics company.\\n Mass production of personal motor vehicles in the United States and other developed countries with extensive territories such as Australia, Argentina, and France vastly increased individual and group mobility and greatly increased and expanded economic development in urban, suburban, exurban and rural areas.[citation needed]\\n In the United States, the transport divide and car dependency resulting from domination of car-based transport systems presents barriers to employment in low-income neighbourhoods, with many low-income individuals and families forced to run cars they cannot afford in order to maintain their income. Dependency on automobiles by African Americans may result in exposure to the hazards of driving while black and other types of racial discrimination related to buying, financing and insuring them.\\n Although intensive development of conventional battery electric vehicles is continuing into the 2020s, other car propulsion technologies that are under development include wireless charging, hydrogen cars, and hydrogen/electric hybrids. Research into alternative forms of power includes using ammonia instead of hydrogen in fuel cells.\\n New materials which may replace steel car bodies include aluminium, fiberglass, carbon fiber, biocomposites, and carbon nanotubes. Telematics technology is allowing more and more people to share cars, on a pay-as-you-go basis, through car share and carpool schemes. Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems. Open-source cars are not widespread.\\n Fully autonomous vehicles, also known as driverless cars, already exist as robotaxis but have a long way to go before they are in general use.\\n Car-share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular, in the US and Europe. For example, in the US, some car-sharing services have experienced double-digit growth in revenue and membership growth between 2006 and 2007. Services like car sharing offer residents to \\\"share\\\" a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighbourhoods.\\n The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells the world's motor vehicles, more than three-quarters of which are cars. In 2020, there were 56\\u00a0million cars manufactured worldwide, down from 67\\u00a0million the previous year.\\n The automotive industry in China produces by far the most (20\\u00a0million in 2020), followed by Japan (seven million), then Germany, South Korea and India. The largest market is China, followed by the US.\\n Around the world, there are about a billion cars on the road; they burn over a\\u00a0trillion litres (0.26\\u00d710^12\\u00a0US\\u00a0gal; 0.22\\u00d710^12\\u00a0imp\\u00a0gal) of petrol and diesel fuel yearly, consuming about 50 exajoules (14,000\\u00a0TWh) of energy. The numbers of cars are increasing rapidly in China and India. In the opinion of some, urban transport systems based around the car have proved unsustainable, consuming excessive energy, affecting the health of populations, and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investment. Many of these negative effects fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars. The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems. The car industry is also facing increasing competition from the public transport sector, as some people re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.\\n Established alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transport such as busses, trolleybusses, trains, subways, tramways, light rail, cycling, and walking. Bicycle sharing systems have been established in China and many European cities, including Copenhagen and Amsterdam. Similar programmes have been developed in large US cities. Additional individual modes of transport, such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted. A study which checked the costs and the benefits of introducing Low Traffic Neighbourhood in London found the benefits overpass the costs approximately by 100 times in the first 20 years and the difference is growing over time.\\n General:\\n \\n Effects:\\n \\n Mitigation:\",\n          \"The Great Gilly Hopkins is a 1978 realistic children's novel by Katherine Paterson. It won the U.S. National Book Award in 1979. In 2012 it was ranked number 63 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by School Library Journal \\u2013 the third of three books by Paterson in the top 100.\\n A film adaptation starring Sophie N\\u00e9lisse as Gilly Hopkins and Kathy Bates as Trotter was released in 2015.\\n The novel has been translated into Catalan, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish. \\u00c1rp\\u00e1d G\\u00f6ncz's Hungarian translation has been adapted into a radio play, with Zs\\u00f3fi J\\u00e1vor playing Gilly and M\\u00e1rta F\\u00f3nay playing Trotter.\\n Galadriel \\\"Gilly\\\" Hopkins is a mean, unfriendly 11-year-old girl who is headed for yet another foster home. She hates living with different people all the time and just wants to settle in with her birth mother, Courtney Rutherford Hopkins, whose photograph Gilly secretly treasures. Gilly doesn't like the look of her new foster mom, Mrs. Trotter, a \\\"fat hippo\\\", and decides she is going to hate her whole life.\\n Gilly hatches a plan to escape from Trotter and steals the money she needs for it to work. She knows that her mother lives in San Francisco, California so she writes a letter to Courtney saying that her beloved Galadriel will be with her soon. When Gilly escapes the first time, she gets caught by police and Trotter immediately comes down to the station to retrieve her. Gilly's grandmother, Nonnie, comes to Trotter's house and tells her that she will take Gilly home. Nonnie was previously unaware that she had a granddaughter. By this time Gilly realizes that she really wants to be with Trotter. However, the law says that Gilly must go with Nonnie, so she goes to Nonnie's house.\\n Then Gilly gets good news: her mother is coming. But when she goes to the airport, Courtney is not the woman in Gilly's photograph: she has stringy hair and a lot of other traits Gilly didn't expect, like being selfish. Gilly also finds out that her mother only came because Nonnie paid her, not because she wanted to come. She realizes for the first time how foolish she has been and that she actually loves Trotter. The story ends with Gilly on the phone, crying to Trotter to take her back. Trotter, in turn, gently convinces her that her home is with Nonnie.\\n The Great Gilly Hopkins won various major accolades:\\n The book has been a frequent target of censors; the novel appears on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books between 1990 and 1999 (20), as well as between 2000 and 2009 (52).\\n On February 8, 2013, it was announced that Stephen Herek would direct a film adaptation of the book, with Kathy Bates as Trotter and Danny Glover in major roles. On February 6, 2014, Sophie N\\u00e9lisse as Gilly Hopkins, Glenn Close and Octavia Spencer joined the cast of the film. On May 9, 2014, Julia Stiles and Bill Cobbs joined the cast of the film. Principal photography began on April 9, 2014, and ended on June 15, 2014. The film premiered at the SCHLINGEL International Film Festival October 6, 2015, and was released by Lionsgate Premiere on October 7, 2016.\\n The novel was adapted as a children's stage musical in 1996 and is available for licensing through Samuel French.\\n The novel was adapted as a made-for-TV movie produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions was televised January 19, 1981, directed by Jeffrey Hayden and teleplay by Charles Pratt Jr. during CBS Afternoon Playhouse.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"en_word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2626,\n        \"min\": 4,\n        \"max\": 12308,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 94,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5386,\n          3408,\n          479\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"en_internal_links\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 98,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Main page; Contents; Current events; About Wikipedia; Help; Learn to edit; Community portal; Upload file; ; learn more; Article; Talk; Read; Read; Upload file; river; Rio de Janeiro; Rio do Sul; R\\u00edo Bec; R\\u00edo Bravo, Tamaulipas; Deerpark, New York; Rio, Florida; Rio, Georgia; Rio, Illinois; Rio, Virginia; Rio, West Virginia; Rio, Wisconsin; El R\\u00edo, Las Piedras, Puerto Rico; R\\u00edo Arriba, A\\u00f1asco, Puerto Rico; R\\u00edo Arriba, Arecibo, Puerto Rico; R\\u00edo Arriba, Fajardo, Puerto Rico; R\\u00edo Arriba, Vega Baja, Puerto Rico; R\\u00edo Abajo, Ceiba, Puerto Rico; R\\u00edo Abajo, Cidra, Puerto Rico; R\\u00edo Abajo, Humacao, Puerto Rico; R\\u00edo Abajo, Utuado, Puerto Rico; R\\u00edo Abajo, Vega Baja, Puerto Rico; Rio Creek, Wisconsin; Rio Grande Valley (Texas); RIO Washingtonian Center; Rio, Italy; Rio, Greece; R\\u00edo Bravo, Suchitep\\u00e9quez; Rio Grande (disambiguation); R\\u00edo Muni; Rio Tuba; Rio Adebisi; Rio Alderton; Rio Fahmi; Rio Fanning; Rio Ferdinand; Rio Goldhammer; Rio Gomez; Rio Hackford; Rio Haryanto; Rio Hillen; Rio Hope-Gund; Rio Komiya; Rio Mavuba; Rio Nitta; Rio Noguchi; Rio Omori; Rio Preisner; Rio Raj; Rio Ramandika; Rio Ramirez; Rio Reiser; Rio Rii; Rio Ruiz; Rio Sakuma; Rio Saputro; Rio Shipston; Rio Suryana; Rio Waida; Rio Wells; Rio Ya\\u00f1ez; Rio Fredrika; Rio Hardy; Rio Hirai; Rio Kanno; Rio Kishida; Rio Locsin; Rio Matsumoto; Rio Natsuki; Rio Natsume; Rio Sasaki; Rio Shimamoto; Rio Shimono; Rio Shirai; Rio Suzuki; Rio Takizawa; Rio Teramoto; Rio Uchida; Rio Waida; Rio Watari; Rio Yamase; Rio Yamashita; Tina Yuzuki; Al Rio; Alexis-Fran\\u00e7ois Rio; Michel Rio (footballer); Michel Rio; Neiphiu Rio; Patrice Rio; Zhaleo Rio; Rio (1939 film); Rio (franchise); Rio (2011 film); Rio (soundtrack); Rio 2; \\\"Rio\\\" (CSI: Miami); Rio: Rainbow Gate!; Rio (Money Heist); Rio (Shaman King); main villain from Juken Sentai Gekiranger; Bob the Builder; Seishun Buta Yar\\u014d; Yu-Gi-Oh!

Each morning, as the golden sun peeked over the horizon, these children would wake to the soothing lullaby of the waves.\\n\\nThe older of the two was Luna, a curious and adventurous girl with hair as silver as moonlight and eyes that sparkled like the brightest stars. Her little brother, Kai, was as playful as a dolphin and had a laugh that sounded like a thousand tinkling seashells. Together, they explored their world filled with ocean treasures and hidden mysteries.\\n\\nOne breezy afternoon, while collecting shimmering sea glass along the sandy shore, Luna and Kai stumbled upon a majestic, old seashell that whispered stories when held close. As they listened, they discovered tales of mermaids who danced under the moonlight, and sea turtles that traveled the world beneath the ocean waves.\\n\\n\\\"Wouldn't it be wonderful to meet them, Kai?\\\" Luna dreamed out loud, her eyes wide with excitement.\\n\\n\\\"Let's follow the whispers!\\\" Kai cheered, as adventurous as ever. And so, hand in hand, they set off on a magical journey across the soft shores and gleaming waves.\\n\\nAs they traveled, they met splendid sea creatures who guided them along the way. A wise old sea turtle named Neptune showed them where the coral gardens bloomed with vibrant colors. A playful pod of dolphins taught them how to ride the waves, filling the air with laughter.\\n\\nFinally, under a sky filled with twinkling stars, Luna and Kai found themselves at a hidden cove. There, they saw mermaids shimmering in the moonlight, their songs creating a beautiful melody that danced with the waves. The mermaids welcomed Luna and Kai, teaching them how to weave dreams from stardust and make wishes upon seashells.\\n\\nThe children learned that when their hearts stayed kind and open, they would always hear the ocean's songs, and it would guide them safely home, no matter how far they wandered.\\n\\nAs the first rays of dawn began to color the sky, Luna and Kai bid farewell to their new friends and promised to share the wonders of the sea with everyone they knew. With hearts full of joy and imagination, they returned home, knowing that the adventure never truly ends when you have the ocean in your heart.\\n\\nAnd every night, as they tucked into bed, the gentle whispers of the old seashell lulled them to sleep, carrying them back to the magic of their ocean friends in dreams. And so, their story flowed, as endless and enchanting as the sea itself. In a tiny village, where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with warm, golden hues, there lived a little girl named Luna. She loved to explore the rolling hills and green forests surrounding her village, discovering hidden streams and secret meadows.\\n\\nOne day, while wandering through the forest, Luna stumbled upon a hidden path she had never seen before. The path was winding and narrow, and it seemed to be calling her name. She decided to follow it, and as she walked, the trees grew taller, and the air grew sweeter with the scent of blooming flowers.\\n\\nSuddenly, Luna heard the most enchanting sound \\u2013 a gentle humming, like the quiet buzzing of a happy bee. She followed the sound and found herself standing in front of a beautiful, sparkling river. And that's when she saw them \\u2013 a group of stones, half-submerged in the water, singing in perfect harmony.\\n\\nThe stones were different shapes and sizes, and each one had a unique voice. There was a deep, rumbling stone that sounded like a gentle giant, a high-pitched stone that sounded like a playful fairy, and a soft, whispery stone that sounded like a lullaby.\\n\\nLuna was mesmerized by the singing stones. She sat down on the riverbank, and the stones began to sing just for her. They sang about the beauty of nature, the magic of the forest, and the wonder of the world.\\n\\nAs the sun began to set, Luna knew it was time to go back to her village. But she promised the singing stones that she would return the next day, and they promised to sing for her again. And so, every day, Luna would visit the singing stones, and they would fill her heart with joy and her spirit with wonder.\\n\\nThe villagers soon heard about the singing stones, and they too began to visit them. The stones sang for everyone, and soon the whole village was filled with laughter and music. And Luna, the little girl who discovered the singing stones, was hailed as a hero, for bringing joy and magic to her community.\\n\\nAs the years went by, the singing stones became a legend, a reminder of the magic that lies just beyond our doorstep. And every time you hear the gentle humming of a happy bee, or the soft gurgling of a river, remember Luna and the enchanting singing stones, and the joy they brought to a tiny village, where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with warm, golden hues.\",\n          \"In a magical kingdom known for its wide-open plains and sparkling rivers, there lived a magnificent wild horse named Spirit. Born under the bright twinkle of a summer sky, Spirit grew from a playful foal into a strong and noble stallion. He galloped proudly, leading his herd through lush meadows and whispering winds.\\n\\nOne evening, while exploring under the soft glow of moonlight, Spirit stumbled upon a group of men with their horses tied nearby, fast asleep. Curious and cautious, Spirit crept closer. But as fate would have it, a twig snapped under Spirit's hoof, waking the men. With a burst of energy, they captured the spirited stallion and took him to a camp surrounded by tall wooden fences.\\n\\nIn this new place, they tried to tame Spirit, but his spirit was strong and free. One day, a young man named Little Creek was also brought to the camp, and he could see that Spirit was no ordinary horse. Little Creek had a kind heart, and he admired Spirit's fierce independence. Together, they devised a clever plan to escape.\\n\\nAs the sun rose brightly, signaling the start of a new day, Little Creek gently whispered his plan to Spirit. With a shared glance of understanding, they made their daring escape, freeing the other horses as they raced toward the open fields.\\n\\nBack at Little Creek's village, Spirit met a beautiful mare named Rain. She was as gentle as the evening breeze and as swift as the river itself. Spirit felt a new kind of freedom in her warm gaze, and they grew close, their hearts dancing in rhythm.\\n\\nBut soon, trouble loomed as men from the camp chased after Spirit and Little Creek. With bravery in their hearts, Spirit and his friends faced many challenges together. In one heroic moment, Spirit leaped across a wide canyon, with Little Creek holding on tightly\\u2014a leap that showed courage can overcome the greatest of fears.\\n\\nThe kind-hearted Little Creek understood Spirit's need for freedom and let him go back to his beloved herd. Rain, now recovered from the dangers they had faced, trotted by Spirit's side. They returned to the golden plains where Spirit's family awaited him.\\n\\nUnderneath the endless sky, Spirit and Rain galloped freely once more, their hooves drumming a joyful tune across the land. And so, in this magical kingdom, Spirit and Rain lived happily, running wild and free under the sunlit heavens. To this day, their story is told with wonder, a tale of bravery, love, and the unbreakable spirit of freedom. Deep in the enchanted forest, where the moonlight filtered through the leaves and the trees whispered secrets to each other, there grew the most magical grapes anyone had ever seen. These weren't just any grapes \\u2013 they sparkled and shone like tiny diamonds, and their sweet aroma filled the air.\\n\\nIn a cozy little cottage at the edge of the forest, a kind old farmer named Leo lived with his curious little rabbit, Rosie. Leo loved nothing more than tending to his garden, but he had always dreamed of growing the magical grapes. One day, while exploring the forest, Leo stumbled upon a hidden path he had never seen before. The path was lined with glittering stones, and it seemed to be calling him towards the magical grapes.\\n\\nAs Leo and Rosie wandered down the path, the trees grew taller, and the air grew sweeter. They soon found themselves standing in front of a beautiful vine, heavy with the most magnificent grapes they had ever laid eyes on. Leo couldn't resist the temptation to taste one, and as soon as the juicy grape touched his tongue, he felt a strange sensation \\u2013 he could hear the grapes singing!\\n\\nThe grapes sang a gentle melody, telling Leo that they would only grow and thrive if he promised to share their sweetness with the entire forest. Leo, being a kind and generous farmer, happily agreed. And so, he carefully plucked a few grapes and shared them with the creatures of the forest.\\n\\nAs the animals tasted the magical grapes, they began to glow with a soft, gentle light. The fireflies twinkled brighter, the rabbits hopped with joy, and the birds sang sweet melodies. The forest was filled with happiness and magic, all thanks to Leo's kindness and the enchanted grapes.\\n\\nFrom that day on, Leo and Rosie tended to the magical grapes with love and care. They shared their sweetness with the forest, and the creatures repaid them with friendship and wonder. As the sun set in the enchanted forest, Leo would smile, knowing that the magical grapes would always remind him of the power of kindness and sharing. And as you drift off to sleep, remember that a little bit of kindness can make the whole world sparkle like the magical grapes.\",\n          \"In a tiny village nestled deep within a magical forest, there lived a group of enchanting, little blue creatures called the Smurfs. These cheerful, three-apples-tall beings made their homes in mushroom-shaped houses that dotted the village like colorful candies.\\n\\nEach Smurf had a special name that matched their personality perfectly. There was Brainy Smurf, who loved to share his wisdom; Jokey Smurf, full of giggles and surprises; and gentle Smurfette, with her golden hair and kind heart. No matter what the task, every Smurf knew just what to do, and they all looked up to their wise, old leader, Papa Smurf, who wore a bright red hat.\\n\\nThe Smurfs\\u2019 days were filled with laughter and song, as they gathered smurfberries and played in the sun-dappled forest. But life wasn't always smooth in the Smurf village. Nearby lurked the grumpy old wizard Gargamel and his sneaky cat, Azrael, always dreaming up plans to capture the Smurfs.\\n\\nYet, the Smurfs were clever and worked together to outsmart Gargamel's tricks, teaching us the power of teamwork and friendship. Whenever Gargamel came too close, the Smurfs would scurry into hiding or use their quick wits to turn his plans upside down.\\n\\nAnd so, in the brightest corner of the forest, the Smurfs continued their joyful adventures. Whether building new things, sharing delicious smurfberry pies, or painting the sky with their laughter, the little blue friends cherished every moment together, reminding us all of the magic that true friendship brings. Not too long ago, in a magical land filled with sparkling stars and whispering trees, there lived a brave and curious little rabbit named Rosie. Rosie loved to explore and play outside, but she had always been fascinated by a mysterious place hidden behind a tall, ancient wall. The wall was covered in vines and flowers, and a big, shiny gate with a sign that read: \\\"The Moonlit Maze.\\\"\\n\\nOne evening, when the moon was full and bright, Rosie decided to sneak out of her cozy burrow and take a peek at the mysterious maze. As she approached the gate, it creaked open by itself, inviting her to enter. Rosie's heart skipped a beat, but she took a deep breath and stepped inside.\\n\\nThe maze was filled with twisting paths, shimmering fountains, and glittering fireflies. Rosie wandered deeper into the maze, her little paws pattering on the stone floor. Suddenly, she heard a soft voice whispering her name. \\\"Rosie, Rosie, come and find the treasure!\\\"\\n\\nRosie's ears perked up, and she followed the voice. The path led her to a beautiful garden filled with moonflowers, their white petals shining like tiny moons. In the center of the garden, Rosie found a glittering crystal nestled in a bed of soft, green moss.\\n\\nJust as she reached for the crystal, a friendly owl perched on a nearby tree called out, \\\"Well done, little Rosie! You've solved the first part of the maze. But to find the real treasure, you need to solve a riddle.\\\"\\n\\nRosie's eyes sparkled with excitement. She loved riddles! The owl asked, \\\"What can be broken, but never held? What can be given, but never sold?\\\"\\n\\nRosie thought for a moment, tapping her chin with her paw. Then, a big smile spread across her face. \\\"The answer is a promise!\\\" she exclaimed.\\n\\nThe owl cheered, \\\"Hooray, Rosie! You're absolutely right!\\\" The maze began to glow, and the paths lit up like a twinkling starry night. Rosie followed the glowing path, which led her to a hidden door. Inside, she found a treasure chest filled with sparkling stars, shiny pebbles, and a note that read: \\\"Congratulations, Rosie! You're the bravest and cleverest rabbit in the land. Keep exploring, and never stop believing in the magic of the moonlit maze.\\\"\\n\\nFrom that day on, Rosie visited the Moonlit Maze every full moon, solving\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Snowy loved to listen to the stories of her wise old grandmother, who would tell tales of brave adventurers and magical creatures.\\n\\nOne evening, as the snowflakes began to fall gently outside, Snowy's grandmother told her the most exciting tale of all. \\\"Snowy, my little one,\\\" she said, \\\"the forest is full of wonders, but you must be brave to discover them.\\\" Snowy's ears perked up, and she felt a thrill of excitement in her heart.\\n\\nThe next morning, Snowy decided to go on an adventure of her own. She packed a small bag with carrots, a bottle of fresh water, and a warm scarf, and set off into the forest. The snow crunched beneath her feet as she wandered deeper into the woods. She met a friendly squirrel who offered her some nuts, and a kind owl who showed her the way.\\n\\nAs Snowy walked, the forest grew quieter, and the trees seemed to grow taller. She came across a frozen pond, where she saw a group of animals ice-skating and laughing together. Snowy joined in, and soon she was gliding across the ice, her paws waving in the air.\\n\\nBut as the sun began to set, Snowy realized she was lost. The forest seemed darker and scarier than before. Just as she was starting to worry, she heard a soft voice calling out to her. \\\"Snowy, little one, come this way.\\\" It was a gentle deer, who led her to a warm and cozy cave.\\n\\n Inside the cave, Snowy found a group of animals gathered around a fire, sipping hot chocolate and telling stories. The deer introduced her to the group, and Snowy felt happy and safe. She realized that even though she was lost, she had found something special \\u2013 new friends and a sense of bravery.\\n\\nAs the night wore on, Snowy knew it was time to go home. The animals said goodbye, and the deer led her back to the edge of the forest. Snowy's grandmother was waiting for her, a warm smile on her face. \\\"I knew you could do it, Snowy,\\\" she said, hugging her tight. \\\"You're a brave and adventurous rabbit, and the forest will always be full of wonders for you to discover.\\\"\\n\\nFrom that day on, Snowy\",\n          \"There was a time when the sun dipped into the ocean, painting the sky with hues of pink and orange, and the stars began to twinkle like diamonds in the night sky. In a small village nestled between two great rivers, there lived a young boy named Kanaq. Kanaq loved to listen to the stories of his grandfather, a wise and kind elder who knew the secrets of the land and the magic that lived within it.\\n\\nOne evening, as the fire crackled and the villagers settled in for the night, Kanaq's grandfather began to tell a tale of a very special canoe. \\\"This canoe,\\\" he said, \\\"was not like any other. It was made of crystal, and it shone like the stars in the sky. The canoe was said to have the power to take its rider on incredible journeys, to places hidden beneath the waves and to the hearts of the mountains.\\\"\\n\\nKanaq's eyes grew wide with wonder as he listened to his grandfather's tale. He couldn't wait to hear more about the magical canoe. \\\"What happened to the canoe?\\\" he asked, his voice full of excitement.\\n\\nHis grandfather smiled and continued the story. \\\"The canoe was said to have been carved by the spirits of the land, who imbued it with their magic. But as time passed, the canoe was forgotten, and it lay hidden in a secret cave, waiting for someone brave and kind to find it.\\\"\\n\\nKanaq's heart skipped a beat as he imagined himself finding the canoe and going on amazing adventures. He felt a sense of longing to find the canoe and to experience the magic that it held.\\n\\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. Kanaq couldn't stop thinking about the crystal canoe. He spent every spare moment searching for it, exploring the rivers and the forests, and talking to the animals that lived there.\\n\\nOne day, as he was wandering through the forest, he stumbled upon a hidden cave. And there, nestled among the rocks, lay the crystal canoe. It shone like the stars in the sky, and Kanaq knew that he had found something truly special.\\n\\nWith the canoe by his side, Kanaq went on incredible journeys, exploring the depths of the ocean and the heights of the mountains. He met creatures that he had never seen before, and he learned about the magic that lived within the land.\\n\\nAs the years passed, Kanaq grew up to be a wise and kind leader, just like his grandfather. And he never forgot the lessons that\",\n          \"There was a time when the ocean was filled with sparkling treasures, and in a hidden corner of the coral reef, a little seahorse named Finley lived. Finley was the most magnificent seahorse in the sea, with a shiny coat that changed colors like the sunset \\u2013 pink, orange, and purple all at once.\\n\\nFinley loved to explore the ocean, playing hide-and-seek among the seaweed and chasing after schools of glittering fish. But Finley's favorite thing to do was to help his friends. He would carry lost shells back to their homes, and even lend a fin to a struggling crab who needed a little push.\\n\\nOne day, a big storm came to the ocean, and the water became murky and dark. The fish were scared, and the coral reef was covered in yucky seaweed. Finley knew he had to do something to help his friends feel safe again.\\n\\nSo, he swam to the heart of the storm, his shining coat lighting the way. As he swam, his coat began to glow even brighter, and the storm started to calm down. The sun peeked through the clouds, and the ocean began to sparkle once more.\\n\\nThe fish cheered, and the coral reef was clean again. Finley's friends thanked him for his bravery, and from that day on, they called him the Shining Seahorse. And every time Finley swam through the ocean, his coat shone bright, reminding everyone of the magical power of kindness and helping others.\\n\\nNow, it's time for you to go to sleep, little one, and dream of Finley's sparkling adventures in the ocean. Just like Finley, you can make a difference in the world by being kind and helping those around you.
